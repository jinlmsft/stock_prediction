Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q3 2018 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.
For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.
Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.
Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2018 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017.
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 25, 2018 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Great. Thank you for taking my question. I guess the big one is the deceleration in unit growth or online stores, which are probably related to that. I know it's a tough 3Q comp, but could you comment a little bit about that? And then kind of what initiatives could be most interesting to maybe reaccelerate that over the next couple of years? What categories? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Thank you, Justin. Yeah, let me just remind you a couple of things from last year. We had two reactions on our Super Saver Shipping threshold in the first half of the year between February and May. That did spur a lot of unit growth in the second and third quarter. We also have issue with digital content, not an issue, but the fact that digital content is moving to subscriptions, Amazon Music Unlimited and Kindle Unlimited in particular. It's been really popular.
I'll just remind you that the units – those do not count in our unit totals nor do the units from Whole Foods Market. So, yeah, I would say essentially with that backdrop, we're still very, very encouraged by the demand and the reception from customers on the consumer side. We have Amazon fulfilled units are still growing faster than paid units. 3P is now up to 53% of total paid units.
In-stock is very strong, especially as we head into the holiday period. I think we're well positioned for the holiday. We have over 100 million Prime eligible items that are available for FREE Two-Day Shipping for Prime members. And again, when we're talking about the unit deceleration, a lot of the fastest growing areas, things like subscription services, AWS and advertising are not caught in that metric.
Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.
And, Justin, this is Dave. Just to add on to that. You mentioned the online stores. Just a reminder, there is a little bit of impact from the revenue recognition. So you see the online stores revenue growing about 11% ex-FX, to be higher than that, but for the adoption ad standard. So there's a little bit of a headwind there as well.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. I was going to also then ask you to drill down a little bit on the international retail business. That seemed to slow down, I guess that whatever, 15% or something year-over-year. Any particularly color? Any markets that would have led to that? Though the comp was tougher, but anything else you'd call out there? Thanks a lot.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. On a year-over-year basis, I think you have to look at two things. We did the Souq acquisition last year in May. So the full pickup on that year-over-year was in 2017 and now we're lapping that. There's also material change in the Diwali calendar in India. About half of our Diwali sales last year were in Q3. This year they'll be fully in Q4. So those are a couple factors that hit the international growth area in particularly.
But I also point out that we launched Turkey in the quarter and now we have 17 Amazon websites globally. So we're still very pleased again with the international business, continue to invest in Prime benefits, international expansion as I just mentioned, and we're still seeing very good pickup. Story is different country-by-country obviously. Some are much further along than others, but overall we're very happy. India, although Diwali moved into Q4, so far that's going really well. We've seen great response from customers. We've had 60% growth in new customers during the period. Orders are coming in from 99% of the pin codes in the country. So, great first wave of the, what we call the Amazon's Great Indian Festival, which lead into Diwali.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question. You had significant operating income upside in 3Q relative to your guide. Can you just talk about the biggest drivers there in terms of outperformance? And then when you think about your 4Q outlook, how should we think about the minimum wage increase that you've talked about? And then any other one-time or special items that might be weighing on that operating income outlook? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. Let me start with Q3 and this will be commentary pretty much on the whole year that was especially true in Q4. So, first of all, we've had very strong growth in some very profitable businesses that we have, most notably AWS and advertising. But we've also had great cost performance this year in three specific areas I'll call out. So, first on head count. If you'll remember, we grew head count 48% in 2016 and 38% last year, if you adjust for Whole Foods. With Whole Foods, it was 66%, but without Whole Foods we still grew 38%.
We have looked to really leverage our investment from the last couple years and as we've funded and moved, invested in a lot of new areas as we've talked about, AWS, devices, digital content, we've had a lot of movement within the company that has filled a lot of those roles. So we're only up 13% on head count through nine months year-over-year. So a real step down in that. Again, the theme here is going to be banking some of the investments from prior years and looking to gain greater control.
In our fulfillment center world, we had grown square footage for our fulfillment center and shipping areas by over 30% the last two years, 2016 and 2017. I've talked about that in prior calls. Making that investment to match up with very strong Fulfilled by Amazon demand and AFN or Amazon Fulfilled Network units that are growing at a faster rate than our paid units.
This year we're only adding about 15% to our square footage. So again, getting better efficiencies on what we have and banking the multi-year investment that we've been making. And the last one, which is really significant, is on the infrastructure side. You see the operating margin for AWS is up to 31% this quarter. A lot of that is based on efficiencies of our data centers, not only for the AWS business, they're also for our Amazon consumer businesses, who is AWS' biggest customer.
If you look at capital leases, which is where we spend money for the data centers, it's up only 9% year-over-year, trailing 12 months, and it was up 69% last year, at the end of the year. So those three areas have driven a lot of the cost performance and a lot of the deviation from probably the estimates that I've come up with this year. So we are really happy that again we're seeing great cost performance in a number of areas across the business.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi. Please proceed.
Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thank you. Question on AWS. Obviously in the last few quarters, you've seen accelerating revenue growth. This quarter, 46%, still quite strong, but dollar and percentage growth did slow. I'm just kind of curious are you just reaching a point in terms of a lot of large numbers where it will be more difficult to sustain not only accelerating growth, but sustain kind of the 40-plus-percent growth levels where we've been recently? Or was there something also going on kind of in the quarter that maybe drove that? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Yeah, thanks for your question. This growth rate is going to bounce around. We've had sequential increase in growth rate the prior three quarters, I believe, it was. This quarter is slightly down, but still 46% growth is very strong. We are at an annualized run rate above $26 billion and that was about $18 billion this time last year. So we're very happy with the growth in the business, the momentum that we're seeing with enterprise customers. And we just mentioned on the cost side, it's been a very good year from gaining greater efficiencies in our infrastructure costs.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, the fourth quarter revenue guide and the fourth quarter revenue deceleration. Maybe can you just help us understand a little bit any of the specific categories or countries that have been the largest contributors to revenue growth throughout the course of this year? And which of those are really slowing down sort of driving this potential deceleration that you're guiding to?
Then the second one, you've applied robotics to the warehouses now around Kiva. Curious for your thoughts about the need or desire to invest in autonomous driving technologies to think about some of the other retailers partnering with Waymo and other players, et cetera.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. Let me talk about guidance. So our guidance for the fourth quarter implies 10% to 20% growth and includes an 80-basis point unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. I wouldn't point to any specific country. Once you adjust for the fact that Whole Foods, it was purchased in August of last year and that has impacted every quarter since then, Q4 will be the first solid non-Whole Foods comp since before we bought them since Q2 of last year.
So if you, even factoring that, and we're looking at Q4 and we have very high error bars on the quarter. Much of our, not only our revenue for the quarter, but also for the year comes in that very tight window between middle of November and the end of the year. So it's always a very difficult period for us to estimate. What I would say is that we feel like we're in great shape for the holiday. The warehouses are very clean. We feel like we're going to have great capacity not only for retail products but also for FBA. We're going to have great capacity for shipping to our customers. So we're very ready to go. Selection should be at its highest point, especially for Prime members. So we're very bullish on the fourth quarter. And we'll just have to see how revenue comes in.
I will say there's one housekeeping item on Prime revenue recognition that you should be aware of and may remember from prior quarters. This year, we took Prime subscription revenue and amortized it over the quarters on a straight line method. Previously, we had done it on a, is tilted more to Q4. It's based more on shipping units. So what you've seen is a push of revenue and income from Q4 into Q1, 2 and 3 that we've mentioned on each call.
This is the quarter where that will reverse. That is to scale it for you. Under the old methodology we would have had $300 million more of both revenue and operating income in the quarter. That has again been caught up for in prior quarters, but again not a huge factor on the growth rate for revenue, but just another item to consider.
On the Robotics, I don't have much to say on autonomous driving. We are putting most of our efforts right now, continue to into our Robotics program. We think it's been a great addition to our fulfillment capacity. It makes the jobs in our warehouse that much better. It makes the people around the robots that much more productive. It allows us to have much greater density of product storage and a number of other benefits. It has some additional capital intensity, but it has good return on invested capital from our standpoint.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question. With a lot of offline retailers talking more about omni-channel, wanted to understand sort of the investments you might be making around unifying the efforts with Whole Foods and Amazon Prime Now, speeding up delivery, giving consumers as much choice as possible and moving SKUs closer to households. How should we be thinking about that push in 2019 and 2020 and how that might open up new areas of wallet share for the company? Thanks guys.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. Yeah, I think we've started to show our strategy on the Whole Foods side. You'll see even this quarter we started to have greater expansion of our grocery delivery out of Whole Foods using Prime Now. We're now in 60 cities in the U.S., giving customers delivery in as fast as an hour on thousands of great organic products from Whole Foods.
We've also expanded grocery pickup and that's available in 10 cities. So the customers can pick up at the Whole Foods store. You'll see that we've started to tie Whole Foods into Alexa. You can build your cart using Alexa and then check out using the Prime Now app. So there's going to be a lot of, as you say, omni-channel overlap, especially in the grocery business.
On the storefront, we're also, as you can see, experimenting with numerous store formats. Amazon Go is now up to six stores. We opened five in the quarter. We're getting great feedback on that. Customers love the ability to quickly walk in, select items they want and leave without waiting in a checkout line. We opened up a Amazon four-star location in New York City where we're going to test the concept of a highly curated selection of top categories across Amazon. We of course have Amazon bookstores, 18 bookstores in the U.S. So we're going to experiment with multiple ways of reaching the customer, wherever they happen to be.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed.
Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Great. I guess two questions. Any color on, it looks like shipping costs and maybe labor costs might see some inflation in 2019. So do you agree with that? Or what are some of the things you can do to potentially offset some of that pressure?
And then, the 15% fulfillment square-footage growth, you're obviously deploying a lot of automation and there's a lot more efficiency gains in the current generation of fulfillment centers than maybe the older ones. So how should we think about a 15%? Is that not a good reading indicator on growth into 2019? Or is it – any color there would be helpful. Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. I think it's comparable to – last question first. I think the 15% is comparable to the 30%-plus that I mentioned in 2016 and 2017. We are debating whether the dynamics of the warehouse are changing so that square footage may not be the main indicator, might be cubic feet, but if we switch to that way of looking at it, we'll make sure that we bridge the gap on the difference between the two.
But the other comment about cost, I believe you're probably referring to the U.S. rumored USPS rate hikes in transportation cost. We're not expecting a material impact from these rate changes in 2019. Annual rate increases from our transportation partners is a really regular occurrence and we negotiate hard and we'll always work hard internally to get even more efficient on our own shipping method. So, we don't see that as being a huge issue.
On wages, of course, we did raise wages and starting November 1 just under 400,000 employees, both full-time and part-time in the U.S. and UK will be getting a substantial wage increase. So that is factored – I'm not quantifying that today, but it's factored into our Q4 guidance and it will be obviously factored into guidance into 2019.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed.
Youssef Squali - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Great. Thank you very much. Two quick questions. First, can you quantify the contribution of PillPack acquisition in the quarter? Maybe help us understand the strategy there.
And then there is some news, reports suggesting that you guys were working on an ad supported video streaming service under the IMDb brand. Can you just help shed any more light on that, is that especially relative to your Prime Video offering? Thank you very much.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Let me start with PillPack. The deal closed in September. So it wasn't a material impact on the quarter, but we're excited, really excited to start working with the management team there. They're very strong. They've done a great job building a highly differentiated customer experience, just customer-centric like we are. And right now our focus is on learning from them and innovating with them on how best to meet customer needs over time. I'll let Dave handle the second question.
Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.
Yeah. I think, I mean, we have no plans to build an ad-supported Prime Video offering for free at this time.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed.
Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Thanks. Two questions. First, I think I may have missed earlier. You gave out the impact of ASC 606.
And then maybe second question, I think what one of the things people are trying to think through is you obviously guide to revenue and operating income, but as the business is more than 3P and advertising, gross profit is now much more important and just the way you kind of capture the value you provide. So maybe if you can – is there a way to just kind of help us kind of foot the perhaps slower revenue growth we're seeing versus what's obviously you extracting kind of more value for your partners and customers and for yourself? Thanks.
Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks, Jason. This is Dave. Just quickly on the ASC impact, Brian mentioned earlier that of course we've been talking about it all year the changing, and the subscription revenue recognition is now straight line. So on a comp basis you'd expect to see subscription revenue be about $300 million lower due to that accounting change.
The other piece that we hadn't talked about is the reclass that we gave in the past few quarters, specifically around the advertising services that have moved from Contra COGS into other revenue beginning in 2018. That was about $750 million increase to that other sales revenue category here in the third quarter.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Yeah. And your comment on revenue versus operating income versus potentially gross profit, I would say the impact of third-party growth and we're now – up to 53% of our paid units in the quarter were third-party. It's steadily been going up. It's up 300 basis points year-over-year. So I think the impact on revenue growth rate, since the revenue component of that is not as large, is probably something to consider on a year-over-year period. I think it tends to not be as big a factor, sequentially quarter-over-quarter is the gradual growth in it. But again, we'll continue to give revenue guidance and also operating income to an appropriately conservative level that we've tried to maintain over time.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.
Anthony DiClemente - Evercore Group LLC
Thanks very much. Just wanted to dig in a little bit on advertising and the growth opportunity there. If you can help us on the potential for higher ad pricing in terms of the ROI for your marketers hopefully being reflected in higher price per ad. And then what about the ad load? So are we kind of close to being at a full ad load? Is there a long runway there? Just trying to get a sense for pricing and volume underneath advertising.
And then also along the lines of advertising, heading into the holiday season, should we expect any increase in your efforts around Alexa commercialization, voice keyword ads let's say, and does that fit into your broader advertising growth strategy? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Yeah, let me talk a little bit more broadly about advertising. So yeah, we are seeing really strong adoption across a number of groups, Amazon vendors and sellers for sure, authors, as well as third-party advertisers who want to reach Amazon customers.
As far as penetration, we don't have that quantified for you, but we still believe that there is a lot of room to continue to improve the presentation of and bringing to our customers new and more relevant purchase options. So we're continuing to invent both on the product side, the tools side with our goal being improve the usability of the tools for advertisers, make smarter recommendations for customers, automate activities so that advertisers don't have to work as hard, and invent new products for advertisers.
If we do this right, we think we'll both help advertisers and help Amazon consumers at the same time. So I know it doesn't answer the question about specific rate increases or capacity, but that is the general strategy that we're seeing in advertising.
Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.
Yeah, and this is Dave. Just jumping on the Alexa point, I mean, I think the short answer is we don't have any plans to add paid advertising to Alexa. I think we clearly had a lot of exciting things happen in the last month or two in terms of new announcements in devices out there. And I mean really looking at that, the goal is to make customers' lives easier and make it more convenient and a lot of that is you're seeing that in the homes and to some extent on the Go. So I think if you look at the recent announcements, you're seeing a few things. I mean, one, we're bringing a lot of cool hardware options to customers.
Second thing, I mean, making the Alexa service smarter. It's getting smarter and more capable. And then also delivering tools for developers, helping them build for and really with Alexa. So I think making her smarter and seeing that she gets smarter with all the skills, leveraging the cloud and AI, becoming more knowledgeable and introducing a lot of really new cool new features. So really excited about the customer response with those devices and those tools so far and looking forward to doing even more.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thanks. Wanted to just follow up on the advertising side and get a sense for how much you guys feel like you're demand constrained versus supply constrained, either in the ability to put more ads on your property and/or just provide the tools to advertisers and do you feel like there's more demand than you can satisfy? Any color you can share there?
Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.
Hey, this is Dave. I mean nothing specific. I mean I think so much of what we're focused on is making sure that there's a high degree of relevancy and usefulness for customers when you look at advertisements that you see on the site in particular and how we position those. And so we spent a lot of time looking at the data to make sure that customer behavior and feedback is telling us that it's useful and helpful and customers making those purchase decisions. And so, we're always testing different levels of that and trying to understand, and the various features, whether it's display or some of the sponsored elements that are out there, what kind of feedback is out there, but certainly keep that in mind as we roll out new things.
Operator
Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please proceed.
Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Great. Thanks. I guess two quick ones. Any change in the trajectory of Prime membership growth since the June price increase? And then, how would you describe the pricing environments for the core AWS services? And is this still a key lever that you use for business development? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Yeah. Sure. Let me start with the Amazon Prime price increase. Of course, that went into effect earlier the year in May. We're very pleased with the renewal data and annual sign up data that we've seen. Since then, program remains very strong, both in membership and engagement, and a lot of our video content, music and shipping definitely as well as other Prime Benefits. We just continue to see that ramp up, not only in the U.S., but in other countries.
So we do continue to make the Prime offer better as well. I mentioned earlier the linkage with Prime member savings at Whole Foods market that we set up in Q2, the expansion of grocery delivery to more than 60 cities in the U.S. using Prime Now and Whole Foods stores, the ability to pick up groceries from Whole Foods. Adding content, we have a great slate of content coming out in the fourth quarter here.
Hopefully, you've seen already Jack Ryan and The Romanoffs and pretty soon you'll see the follow-up season to The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and also a couple other things, and hopefully you'll see Thursday Night Football tonight when you get home.
Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.
This is Dave. Just on the AWS pricing philosophy. I mean, just a reminder. When we look at this, our pricing philosophy has worked relentlessly, take cost out of our own cost structure and where we can pass savings on to the web services customers in the form of lower prices. So it's easy to lower prices, but it's much harder to be able to afford the lower prices and that's something we work very hard in all our businesses, including AWS to do that. So when you look at AWS now, we've lowered prices 67 times since we launched, including a few more in the last few months. So those pre-OC price reductions are a normal part of our business for us.
Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.
(30:42) call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our IR website, at least through the end of the quarter.

Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q2 2018 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.
For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead?
Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.
Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2018 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017.
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 26, 2018 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict the demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.
Question-and-Answer Session

At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post from Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
Justin Post - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch
Great. Thank you. I guess, the standout metric of the quarter was the profitability and the margins. Both U.S. and International have improved year-over-year. Could you talk about (03:04) was it better than your expectations for the quarter? And then maybe reasons for the ad business to accelerate within the other line? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure, yeah. Thanks, Justin. Yeah, for the quarter, so it was a strong quarter. We had – what I attribute it to is continued strength in our – some of our most profitable areas. AWS had its third consecutive quarter of accelerating growth, 49% FX-neutral growth. Advertising also had strong growth. Elsewhere we saw probably better than expected efficiencies in operations, our infrastructure costs, and generally all of our fixed costs.
You'll note that in the first half of the year capital leases were flat year-over-year, although we're up 20% for the full trailing 12 months, in the last 6 months it's been pretty flat as the team has really worked well to plan our data centers run our data centers more efficiently, even to meet again increasing usage at our customers; usage rates are exceeding our growth rate.
So that's what I would point to. Internationally, a lot of the same factors hold. I would say that, in addition to the operating efficiencies, advertising is also starting to make an impact on gross profit, although advertising is smaller in International segment than it's in North America, it's growing at a same rapid clip year-over-year.
Even while in International, we're continuing to invest in a lot of areas, we continue to frontload Prime benefits for the newer geographies, we continue to launch new countries as we launch Prime in Australia recently. We've launched devices in multiple countries, Echo and Alexa were launched in France. Echo Spot was launched in India and Japan in the last quarter. So continued – it's a mix of operating efficiencies as we grow, and then also continuing to invest on a lot of fronts.

Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Hey, maybe two things. Just a little bit of color on that unit growth, I think, it was 17%, any particular things to call out there as that would have stunted that growth or negatively limited? Or is that just kind of the new, new normal?
And then Brian, I'm sorry, you just talked better than expected efficiencies in operations, could I ask you to tease that out a little bit more, and a little more color particularly on the retail side of the business? Are there particular newfound efficiencies that are sustainable? Thanks a lot.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. Let's start with unit growth. So I will note, we did a very strong unit growth rate last year in Q2, with 27%, so we're comping against that. As we look back on that, there were number of factors. I mean, in any quarter there can be product mix or ASP differentials which shift the unit growth figure, but if you also remember, we dropped our Super Saver Shipping threshold twice, the early part of last year from $49 to $35; and then down to $25.
So there was a bit of growth, particularly in lower ASP items from that, that we saw last year. So we're comping that. Another factor is digital content that moves to subscription. So Amazon Music and Kindle Unlimited, while they're very successful and it's a good transition, they just – the units do not count in this unit calculation.
So there's some things like that, that maybe obfuscate the numbers a bit, but we're really pleased with the retail growth. We think it's driven by again Prime, the Prime program, the engagement of Prime customers as well as increased selection, and particularly third-party selection.
On operations, if you look at probably the last 18 months, you're going to see a lot of different pace of increase in both infrastructure costs and capital costs, and the addition of fixed cost heads. So one thing that you'll notice is that, we've grown – we've stepped down our rate of growth of fixed head count, excluding the acquisitions we've grown 26% year-over-year at the end of June, on a trailing 12 month basis.
But 23% of that was in the second half of last year. So we are continuing to look at where we're investing head count. We're seeing a lot of our growth areas being fueled by head count that's moving within the company. There's a lot of movement of tech head count. And so there was less external hiring in the first half of this year. We don't think that, that's necessarily the long-term trend, but it certainly created a lot of operating efficiencies, and now we'll reset and evaluate where we need to still add people.
So I think the first half of the year could be a good test of where our cost structure is, coming off of the investment that leads up to the holiday. Last year, there was a lot of first half investment. If you look back on infrastructure and fixed head count that may be made that less pronounced. But this year it's a little more apparent.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to ask two, if I could. First, 3Q is typically a heavy fulfillment center build out period ahead of the holidays, and then lower utilization, but obviously your profit outlook is good. Can you just give us a sense of how you're thinking about FC build out and square footage increases this year?
And then, secondly a lot of excitement around the pharmacy opportunity with the acquisition of PillPack. Can you frame some of the strategic rationale there around the acquisition, and how that helps advance your efforts, and how we should think about integration going forward? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. On the fulfillment center capacity, I don't have a number for you, today. I'll probably clarify that at the end of next quarter as we head into holiday, but if you think back, the last two years, we've added square footage that's exceeded 30% growth, both in 2016 and 2017.
We anticipate it's going to be lower this year as we get some efficiencies off what we've built over the last few years, but I don't have a number for you today. I will say that, the majority of it is being put in service in the back-end of the year, just like in the last two years. But I'll – we'll clarify that next quarter.
On PillPack, yes, the deal of course hasn't closed, yet. We expect to close it in the second half of the year, so I'll limit my comments right now. But we're excited. I think the company has a really highly differentiated customer experience, and they've done a great job getting to the size and scale that they're at today. We think that, working together with them we can expand on that in the future.
They're like a lot of the other acquisitions we've done. Recently, we're looking for well-run companies with highly-differentiated customer experience, and a real sense of customer obsession that matches ours. So we think PillPack has got all those traits, and we look forward to the deal closing and working with them.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thanks. On AWS, does the backlog there give you confidence in the ability for this business to continue to post the type of robust growth that you've seen of late? And on Alexa, now that you're reaching a meaningful number of Alexa users, I wondered if you could discuss a bit more about how Alexa is impacting retail business?
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. Let me start with AWS. Yeah, we're very happy with the results we're seeing, and the backlog that we see, and the new contracts and new customers and the expansion of existing customer business that we see. Again, the business has accelerated the last three quarters, and we're seeing great signs in a number of areas.
We've added 800 new services and features so far this year; that's an accelerated pace from last year, which was a record year. We see customers have migrated more than 80,000 databases using the AWS Database Migration Service.
And customers are just branching out to a lot of new products from us. There are new areas like machine learning, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, serverless computing and database and analytics are really big. So we think that, when you look at it, why do people come to us? It's essentially set functionality and pace of innovation that we've demonstrated for multiple years. We've built a very strong partner and customer ecosystem. And frankly we've the most proven reliability of security and performance, and we've been at this longer than anyone else.
So again, we continue to deliver for customers. We continue to use feedback from customers to develop new services and features. The operating margin itself will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, a very strong performance this quarter. Obviously, part of that was in the capital leases being flat year-over-year, and the team's ability to really run the data centers at a higher efficiency.
Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.
Yeah. And I think, the second question was just related to how is Alexa impacting the business, overall. And – hey, this is Dave. I mean, I think, we're having a lot of success with devices and customers are enjoying those. We talked to coming out of Prime Day, had some good success and happy customers enjoying some of the devices there. So I think, that's a lot of – the focus now is really having a good and exciting roadmap of recent revises and more to come ahead, and getting those into customers' hands.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you. Just on the AWS point, as you're seeing customers to AWS, you're adding new customers to AWS, can you give us a sense of sort of where you're seeing customers spend focus. How successful – you mentioned database, but what other areas you're potentially seeing as customers move up the stack with you and grow?
And then, you flagged the flat capital lease growth on a year-over-year basis. In the past when you've talked about the growth in CapEx and capital lease, you generally referred to trying to grow those numbers or that infrastructure growth overall more or less with the business. Is there some level of efficiency breakthrough that you've gotten there where that's no longer the case? Or is it a function of timing? How should we think about what that CapEx and capital lease spend signals about your expectations for growth?
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. I would say it's just a demonstration of the very tight period where we – we've still added a lot, I mean, $4.6 billion is a lot of capital leases, but the rate of growth over last year is flat. So what I would say is, I'm not sure about the breakthrough element of it. We do spend a lot of time driving better efficiency in our data centers. We do see it; sometimes it is higher than other quarters. The starting point for our expectation would be, the usage growth would be very – that our growth in infrastructure costs would start with the growth in usage, which has been exceeding the revenue growth rate.
But we can drive more efficiently and we can sometimes bank the efficiencies of prior investments that we've made in other periods. So it will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. I would say last year in the first half was a pretty large investment area. I'll lump it in with capital expenditures, but in the first two quarters, Q1 of last year, it was 82% growth year-over-year in capital expenditures, Q2 was 67%.
This year, those numbers are 33% in Q1, and 1% in Q2. So it's a – there's a bit of timing at play here, but I think overall, in the longer-term, we certainly work to drive efficiency in both AWS infrastructure capability, and also in our warehouse networks.
I don't have on the other piece, on product detail, I don't have anything more for you. I would just say that, our growth is coming from customers that span from start-ups to enterprise customers to government agencies, and they start small and then they continue to build and shift their businesses to us, and many of them have gone – a large number have gone all-in on AWS, and have had a chance to lower their cost structures as a result. I'd count Amazon in that category, because on the consumer side of the business, we increasingly see infrastructure savings due to the conversion to AWS resources.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my questions, I have two. The first one on the ad business, Brian, I was just wondering, could you give us some examples of some products you've had particular success with on the ad side? And I know you guys are always focused on removing customer friction points and solving pain points for customers, maybe talk to us about some of the still existing pain points for your advertiser customers you're looking to address with the advertising product?
And the second one, I know it's an accounting question, but we're going to be asked it a lot. On revenue accounting, can you just sort of walk us through any of the accounting changes that any of the revenue lines had in the current quarter because of the multiple accounting moving pieces? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Yeah, let me give Dave a chance afterwards to talk about that piece, but I'll start with advertising. So conceptually stepping back, it's now a multi-billion dollar business for us. We're seeing strong adoption across a number of fronts. Amazon vendors, sellers, authors as well as third-party advertisers who want to reach Amazon customers.
So we have hundreds of thousands of emerging and established advertisers. And they're using our services to achieve their marketing goals to – whether that's to drive new brand awareness, discovery or ultimately purchase decisions on our site.
Pain points and improvements, I would say, our priorities include improving the usability of our tools for advertisers, helping make smarter recommendations for customers. Automating, we're doing a lot of work on automating the activities that the advertisers need to do, and continue to invent new products for those advertisers.
We also think measurement is going to be important so we're focused on our measurement capabilities, so advertisers understand what outcomes they're driving on our properties. And we think that we're uniquely positioned to show them the direct benefit of their advertising.
Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.
Yeah. And Brian, this is Dave. Just on the accounting piece, specifically to Q2, the impact of the Accounting Standards Update, revenue recognition changes we did starting in the first part of year, it's a $640 million increase to other revenue, specifically related to how we treat some of the advertising service.
So you remember as part of the adoption beginning in 2018, certainly the advertising services were classified as revenue rather than cost of sales. So $640 million more is in other revenue this second quarter. You'd see that in that line item, which is about $2.2 billion here in the second quarter.
In addition to that, some of the other factors I talked about last quarter, some of the treatment of gross to net changes in some sales of apps and app content, digital media costs, some of that shift created a headwind for online stores revenue. So that year-over-year growth rate for that line item would have been higher, but for that change.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks so much. Two questions if I can. On Whole Foods, any update on the integration of Whole Foods within the broader Prime ecosystem, the way in which you're tying those assets and customer bases together to sort of promote the flywheel that you've talked about a fair bit?
And Prime Now, any update on the scale of markets globally, and what you're learning as Prime Now continues to scale in terms of how users adopt the service, putting SKUs closer to prem what that does to the velocity of purchasing? Thank you so much.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. So, it was a big quarter for Whole Foods and Prime. We launched additional savings for Prime members at Whole Foods. If you go to Whole Foods store or Whole Foods Market 365 store, you see a lot of yellow stickers for 10% discounts of hundreds of sale items. You also see deep discounts on selected popular products. So Prime members have adopted this benefit, it's one of the fastest rates we've ever seen for a Prime benefit, and they've already saved millions of dollars on everything from seasonal favorites to as I said popular daily sales.
So in addition, we've expanded grocery delivery to 20 cities so that's picking up steam. During the Prime Day, we had some unique deals for Prime customers at Whole Foods. Actually, the deals lasted for a week at Whole Foods. And people had, again the ability to see the benefit that Prime membership save incremental dollars, because of it at Whole Foods. And the Prime Rewards Visa Card, which gives you 5% off on all purchases has been applied to Whole Foods' purchases as well.
So that is the second wave, probably after the first wave where we talked in previous calls about initial price drops, putting lockers in the stores, selling some of the Whole Foods' products on the Amazon site, and other things. So the invention level is still really high. We think it's a big milestone this quarter to launch Prime benefits with Whole Foods, and we'll keep going, we'll see how that develops.
Prime Now, I guess, my comments are that, it's in 50 cities worldwide, it's across 9 countries. It is different than – we have multiple options for you in grocery delivery. We have the delivery services – so AmazonFresh and Prime Now which serve a certain need. We have a traditional grocery store now with Whole Foods, and then we have the combination of those two with home delivery, and we're using Prime Now or Whole Foods products through Prime Now to make those deliveries as well as the new kind of stores with Amazon Go that we're experimenting with. So lots of innovation, invention on that front as well.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Good evening. Hey guys, I had two questions. First is on the Music business. So I think, you said recently you had tens of millions of paying subscribers. So are those paying music listeners coming from Prime, and using the mobile app, or they coming in from Echo? Any color on what's driving that uptake and converting users into paid members?
Then the second question is, you mentioned efficiency gains in retail and the improvement in retail operating margin. If we look at International, it's still negative, but it's also improving pretty meaningfully, so can you parse where that improvement's coming from between India and the other emerging markets versus some of the more mature markets in Western Europe?
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure, let me start with that second question. So, yes, we have seen over the last few quarters, improved operating margins internationally. I would say in places like Europe and Japan, we're seeing many of the efficiencies I talked about earlier on fixed head count, operations costs, infrastructure costs, and also things like marketing working to be very efficient. I would also say that, although it's smaller internationally the impact of advertising is starting to show up more and more internationally. It's growing quite quickly just as it is in North America.
But you're right. We continue to invest. We're investing in India obviously, and have seen good traction there. We just passed our Fifth Year Anniversary – celebrated our Fifth Year Anniversary, as the most visited site in India. So we think there's a lot of great innovation that has continued to occur for Indian consumers and sellers, and that will continue.
But you're also seeing additional expansion. So we launched Prime in Australia; we're rolling devices out. We launched Echo and Alexa in France. The Echo Spot in India and Japan, and we announced that we're going to expand Echo and Alexa soon to Italy, Mexico and Spain. So I would say that we're continuing to frontload Prime benefits in the newer geographies. So that's one of the issues that we see with operating margin.
But we think it's the right thing to do. We are seeing strong traction in that front as well. We also like that the – on Prime Day, we were able to expand our list of countries that experience Prime Day; this year to Australia, Singapore, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. So we're very bullish on our International business. We do realize it's a period of investment and we're in different stages of growth in different countries.
Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.
Yeah, and this is Dave. Just quickly on Music, as you mentioned, tens of millions of paid customers are enjoying Amazon Music. When you look at the Amazon Music Unlimited subscription, it continues to grow very quickly. We've got those offerings in more than 30 countries now and the catalog there's tens of millions of songs, and a lot of rich playlists, personalized stations, those kinds of things.
Of course we started in Music with Prime Music, a little bit earlier in that space, and I think that's been a great way for Prime members to enjoy some of that catalog for free, and then as they enjoy that, be able to move into the Amazon Music Unlimited skill.
One of the great things that's also part of that, I think, you alluded to it is just Alexa, and one of the most popular features we see as you probably imagine for using those devices are just interacting with Alexa, wherever you may be is being able to listen to music. So that's proven to be a, I think, a good skill for folks to be able to enjoy in addition to a really kind of rich and growing Amazon skill set. We now have more than 45,000 skills available to customers.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Youssef Squali with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question.
Youssef Squali - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Thank you very much. On the new Supreme Court decision, you guys have been collecting state taxes in all 45 states where it's applicable for a 1P. And for a 3P, I think, it was in two states. Have you seen any slowdown to growth in these two states since you began collecting taxes? I think, you started maybe last 12 months or so.
When will you start collecting taxes in the rest of the country, and will you charge for it? Because my understanding is that, in those two states you do not collect or you do not charge to help these 3P sellers file taxes or collect state taxes. Thank you.
Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.
Yeah. Hey, Youssef this is Dave. So right now, as you mentioned 45 states that have state-imposed sales tax, first-party products we do our own collection on that. For 3P sellers right now, it's three states. So Washington State started as of January 1, Pennsylvania as of April 1, and most recently Oklahoma on July 1. So those are the ones where we're collecting and remitting. We haven't said – and to your second point we've not talked about any kind of trends. As you could imagine some of these are still really early days.

Thank you. Our final question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Thanks. Given the focus in the press release about Alexa Voice Services, any thoughts about how you would monetize on third-party devices? And then just a follow up on Amazon Prime Video Channels, any plans to offer standard skinny bundles to become a cable replacement? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Yeah, let me start with Alexa. So right now, our emphasis is around expanding the reach of Alexa and the usefulness. So as Dave mentioned, we're now up over 45,000 skills. We have a developer network of – that's expanded and we have over 13,000 smart home devices from 2,500 unique brands. You're seeing things like expansion into the hotel space where we're partnering with hotels to allow you to experience Alexa while you're traveling.
And you saw from the quote that was in our press release from Jeff, the number of Alexa-enabled devices has tripled in the past year, so – including some really large companies like Polk, Sonos, Acer, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, BMW, Ford, Toyota to name a few. So that's the biggest emphasis, is getting the expansion of Alexa to places where it can be useful. We also are developing new machine learning tools to help developers more easily build Alexa skills. We feel like we're getting great traction there.
So I think your original question was about monetization of Alexa, but right now the biggest thing we can do is to make it as useful as possible, and make devices that can use the skills.
Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.
Yeah, and then just on the second question. I mean, I can't speculate on what we might do in the future, but I'd say today, with Prime Channels, I think, we're really pleased with the growth we're seeing. We've seen some good channels come online over the last few quarters, and seen some good traction there. So we'll keep focusing on building out even better selection, because it's clear to us that customers want that option to be able to add that content as part of their Prime memberships.
Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.

Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q1 2018 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.
For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.
Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.
Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2018 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017.
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 26, 2018 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict the demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
At this time, we will now open up the call for questions. Our first question comes from line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks so much for taking the question. Wanted to ask if you had any update on the state of the advertising business, sort of the state of conversations with advertisers? What product uptake you're seeing out in the marketplace? And sort of how that's looking now as we move out of 2017 and into 2018 broadly for the platform? Thanks so much.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Yes, sure, Eric. I would say advertising continues to be a bright spot both from a product standpoint and also financially. It continued to be a strong contributor to profitability in Q1. It's now a multibillion-dollar program. You can see the – in our supplemental revenue disclosure, it's in other revenue, and it's the majority of the other revenue in that line item.
So our philosophy there again is we're continuing to focus on finding valuable ways to make our advertising opportunities better for customers, showing them new products that they may not have seen otherwise and also for emerging and established brands, helping them to reach customers. I think the advertisers generally are all shapes and sizes, and their common theme is they all want to reach our customers generally to drive brand awareness, discovery and eventually purchase.
Before I go into the second question, I want to make a comment about the Prime program. The Prime program continues to drive great strength in our top line, as you've seen over the last few years actually. We continue to increase the value of Prime, including speed selection and digital entertainment options. We've been expanding FREE Same-Day Shipping and One-Day options. And our Two-Day shipping, it's now available on over 100 million items, up from 20 million as recently as 2014. And we continue to add digital benefits like Prime Video.
The value of Prime to customers has never been greater. And the cost is also high, as we pointed out especially with shipping options and digital benefits, we continue to see rises in costs. So effective May 11, we're going to increase the price of our U.S. annual plan from $99 to $119 for new members. The new price will apply to renewals starting on June 16.
Prime provides a unique combination of benefits, and we continue to invest in making this Prime program even more valuable for our members. As a reminder, we haven't increased the U.S. annual price of Prime since our single increase, which was in March of 2014.
Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.
Yeah. And, Eric, sorry to just go back to your initial question too, just to hop back on that, just wanted to remind folks that we mentioned this last quarter on the call. But on January 1, we adopted an accounting standard update that amended our revenue recognition policies.
So the net impact to revenue in the first quarter was not material, but I do want to highlight a few areas. As part of the adoption beginning in Q1, certain advertising services were classified as revenue rather than a reduction of costs of sales. So the impact of this change was an increase of $560 million to other revenue in Q1, which is – the other revenue is, of course, part of our supplemental sales disclosure.
So you'll see that other revenue, in total, increased 132% ex-FX year-over-year to about $2 billion in the first quarter. Again, $560 million is included in there, and the majority of that is – would be included in the North America segment.
As you look at the other supplemental line item, just a few items of note. The line item online stores revenue increased about 13%, ex-FX. Beginning in the first quarter, sales of apps, in-app content, and certain digital media content are now presented on a net revenue basis and included in third-party seller services revenue, rather than that online stores revenue. So in the first quarter, online stores revenue would have been higher, but for this new standard.
And then the line item, subscription services revenue, that increased about 56% ex-FX year-over-year. Prime memberships are included in that line. Again, beginning in the first quarter, we now recognize annual Prime membership revenue straight line over the 12-month period. Prior to 2018, we recognized this revenue over the 12-month period with more revenue allocated to the fourth quarter each year. So in Q1 of this year, subscription services revenue would have been lower, but for this new standard.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my questions. So the first one on Prime, let me ask you this. As you think about your U.S. Prime penetration, there's some data that shows you're doing a very good job at capturing a lot of the middle to higher income households and now you're raising price. Talk about the tension point you need to solve to sort of reach some of the lower income households and even households that are not yet Prime. What are the main reasons why people in the U.S. are not signing on for Prime at this point?
And the second one on early learnings from the integration of Prime Now and Whole Foods, recognizing it's only in a few cities, what can you share about what you're seeing about purchase behavior, early learnings? And what are the main signposts you're watching as you determine how quickly to roll that out to more cities in the U.S. and hopefully, New York soon?
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. On your first question about Prime penetration, without getting into any statistics on penetration and by country, I would say we do have other options for, if you'll notice, there's the monthly option, obviously provides more flexibility for people who want to try out Prime before committing to the annual plan. There's discounted student plans. There's also discounts for other groups. So, we do feel it's still the best deal in retail, and we just work to make it better and better each day.
The second thing you mentioned is a good example. So, the ability in 10 cities to get Prime Now deliveries of Whole Foods groceries is an added benefit for people in that market using Prime – those markets using Prime Now. So as far as the Whole Foods, specifically on the question of what we'll look at as far as expanding that grocery delivery, we're going to use the 10 cities as a test and see how customers respond, just like we always do, and make sure that our deliveries are great for those people, and then we'll announce expansion plans once we digest that, the feedback we get from customers.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you. I was just wondering if you could give us a sense, the accelerating growth that we saw in the U.S. business in Q1, how much of that or how would you sort of segment that in terms of specific categories? Are there any specific categories that you would call out in terms of driving that?
And then, as we look at the like acceleration in the AWS business, any sense that you can give us in terms of what volumes or customer, you specifically call out sort of customer additions in some of your comments, what customer additions have looked like in terms of driving that business, particularly against sort of the comp against last year's price cuts?
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. So first, with the – you've mentioned North America revenue growth, and you can calculate that with and without the impact of Whole Foods, I'm sure. But the general drivers continues to be Prime and the Prime flywheel. So we see strong customer demand, not only for the benefits that we associate with Prime, we're seeing better engagement with Prime benefits, especially digital benefits, and that is always good news for eventual sales of other things.
We're also selling more subscriptions, Amazon Music Unlimited, multiple Kindle Unlimited, there's a number of services. So there's different revenue streams that we see. So, not much more I can add by product line to North America. And I talk about AWS revenue, again, we're – we are accelerating. We've accelerated for the last two quarters. The FX-neutral growth was 48% in Q1, up from 44% on the same basis in Q4 and 42% in Q3. And now nearly a $22 billion run rate.
So what we're saying is just continued strong usage both by existing customers and signing new customers for – see increased pace of enterprise migrations as customers are having success with AWS and increasingly trying new services. We are seeing people move more and more of their workflows to AWS and at a faster pace. And customers are moving databases to AWS as Aurora continues to grow at a very rapid clip.
So stepping back, I would say, what is driving the growth, we believe, again, it's the value that we create for AWS customers. We have the functionality and pace of innovation that others don't. We have partner and ecosystem that others don't. And we have proven operational capability and security expertise that's highly valued to the AWS customer base.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Mark A. May - Citi Investment Research
Thank you. Some of the data that we've seen suggests that this year, the rate of growth in the build out of fulfillment centers and other parts of the retail logistics network as well as data centers, but more on the former, that rate of growth is slowing this year relative to last year and even the year before. I know that you guys go through periods of kind of heavy investment, then you grow into that capacity. But I just wonder if you could comment a little bit about where we are kind of in that ebb and flow of that cycle right now.
And in terms of the accounting change that Dave referenced earlier with regard to revenue going from cost of revenue to the other line, can you comment if that particular type of advertising, that trade dollars type of marketing, is that growing at a meaningfully different rate than the ad revenue that's already booked as revenue? Thanks.
Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.
Yeah, Mark, this is Dave. On that second question, we've not commented on the growth rate or given the prior year period, so not much we can say there. As I said, the $560 million, if you were to back that out and look at the sort of pre-existing advertised – or other revenue rather that was included in that line item, we'd be growing about 72%. But again, that's not in relation to the COGS portion.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
And on the question on capacity, – excuse me, cap – I'll address it as CapEx and capital leases, we're still seeing strong investment there. If I look at the quarterly trends, you're right, that this quarter was up 33% in isolation versus last year. I look back to last year's first quarter and we grew 82% year-over-year. So it was a particularly heavy quarter, particularly for investment in warehouses.
So if I step back on the trailing 12 months though, CapEx, which is predominantly tied to our fulfillment center network, is up 47%. That is above the Amazon fulfilled unit growth rate, but we combined the strength of the FBA program and the space requirements as we get into bigger and bigger products. That's a representative number for that period.
On the capital leases, which is a good proxy for the spend to support the AWS business, that's up 49% year-over-year on the trailing 12 months.
So again, usage rates continue to exceed the revenue growth rates. Usage rates are strong, but we also have a number of projects underway that seek to increase our efficiency of our data centers. So have a couple things at play there that hopefully keep that number closer to the revenue growth rate.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question. Brian, you had significant operating income upside in 1Q and I think a better outlook for the second quarter than many expected. Can you just talk about the biggest factors that drove the delta relative to your 1Q guide? And is there any reason to think that you couldn't see similar leverage in the back half of the year? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. Yes, we came in well above our range that we had given of $300 million to $1 billion. I would attribute it primarily to a few things. First, the top-line growth was – continued to be strong coming out of Q4. We had great consumer business strength. We also had strong AWS revenue strength, where I already mentioned that we accelerated into the quarter, which is a different trend that we've seen recently. So customer adoption in AWS remained strong.
And when we hit the higher end of our range or just above our range on – with FX included, we generally see really good drop through on the incremental sales, given the fixed costs we have in fulfillment centers and data centers and quite frankly, people. So we saw great efficiencies at the higher level of revenue, and we're able to handle it. So that was generally very good financially.
We – at the time of guidance, we were concerned a bit about the high – relatively high inventory we had at year-end in space utilization. So we're still very full in our fulfillment centers. But we were able to correct that due to the high sales without having additional handling and transportation cost that you would normally see the reconfigure inventory locations. So that also helped and probably differential versus the guidance estimate.
And then, lastly, I would say, advertising continues to be a strong contributor to profitability and had strong results this quarter. As far as what that portends for future quarters, for now, I want to focus on Q2 and it's incorporated into our Q2 guidance. So we expect a lot of the strength areas to continue, consumer demand, AWS and advertising. We will definitely see higher investments as we move through the year. For example, video content spend will increase year-over-year, and we'll continue to hire, in particular, software engineers.
We'll have some costs in Q2 ahead of what's anticipated to be a Prime Day in early Q3. So – and then as you know, Q3 is generally a lower quarter due to all the work to get ready for holiday and the hiring of people and building teams. So, I won't go beyond Q2 at this point, but again, we're very happy with the customer reception we had in Q1 and then the income that, that drove.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Great. Thanks. Two questions. The $239 million in other income, what was that? And then could you just wax a little bit eloquently hopefully, on advertising revenue? And like how do you balance what are – what should be a monstrous amount of ad revenue opportunities, especially high profit, high margin ad revenue opportunities against an ideal or optimal consumer experience? These sponsored units I see in every search I do on Amazon seems great from an advertising perspective, but I sometimes wonder if it doesn't dilute the consumer experience. So just talk about how you balance that.
And then finally, as part of advertising, you've got also a heck of a lot inventory around all of that video, that Prime Video that you have that you don't allow – that you don't directly charge for, how do you think about that as an advertising revenue opportunity? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. Let me wax eloquently. Try to anyway. So let's start with the $239 million; that is essentially where attributable to warrants that we have in companies that we partnered with. We have transportation companies that we partnered with and other technology companies. As the stock market increased in Q1, a lot of these companies also went up. So that's where we book the gain on warrants that we have with – on investments. It's also – there was a good bit of FX gain due to the shift in currency and the weakening of the dollar. That showed up on a lot of lines on the P&L, but that one was positive.
On advertising, so let's step back a bit. It's now a multibillion-dollar program and growing very quickly. Our main goal here is to help customers discover new brands and products. So we show the sponsored products, we're trying to show people things they had maybe wouldn't have seen otherwise in their normal search results. So we're looking for a good balance here, as we said.
We want customers to get the benefit of the new brand and product discovery, and then we want to let sellers for both emerging and established brands, reach those customers. Those advertisers are of all shapes and sizes with the main goal of, again, trying to reach our customers whether it's to drive brand awareness, discovery or hopefully purchase.
So, we take the responsibility for that very seriously and are always balancing helpfulness of the advertising and try not to make it disruptive. But you're right, there are always pressures in that. We will come down on the side of the customer.
On your question on video advertising, yes, there may be opportunities over time to have more advertising in our Video, but we choose not to do that right now.
Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.
Yeah, I think the only thing I'd add to on that just related to Prime Video, as you may have seen in the announcement earlier today about the renewed agreement for the streaming partnership with Thursday Night Football. So we'll have 11 games in 2018 and 2019, be able to deliver that to over 100 million Prime members globally, which is a great continuation of the partnership we've had with the NFL.
We've done some things like the Prime Original Series All or Nothing; the third season's coming up soon, focused on the Dallas Cowboys. So that was one of our first forays in the live format that – one of the first forays in the live format where we had live ads and kind of, we're not only learning the technology, but learning to – learning that business. And I think we've been pleased with what we've seen so far obviously and look forward to the next few seasons with the NFL.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Thank you. So I think, Brian, I had a question on your international shopping rollout, so I think this was recently announced. Where do you think you measure up versus some of the more local players where you might not have a direct presence in the country? And where do you think your value proposition lies? And presumably this is informed by users coming in from those regions where you don't really have an official site for people come in to buy stuff from you anyway. So, which regions or countries are accounting for most of the demand that you are seeing? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Stephen, are you're still on? Can you elaborate more on the countries you're talking about, specifically?
Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
No, I'm just wondering, you already have a direct presence in some of the countries like China, Japan, et cetera, and the international shopping rollout presumably expands all that selection to most of the globe. So just wondering if you are seeing incremental demand, and where you might be seeing demand coming in from countries where you might not have a direct presence?
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Oh, on global store? Okay. Yes.
Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Yeah.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Yeah. Sorry, I thought you meant some of our expansion countries. So, yeah, I don't have a lot to share on that today, but I think you hit on the main point, is selection and opportunities for sellers in – who are with us in different countries to reach buyers outside of their home country. So it's a great benefit for sellers, and it only works if it's a great benefit for customers on the other side.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
Justin Post - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch
Yeah, thank you. I'd like to maybe dive into a couple of local recent overhangs. First, on shipping partners, just wondering how dependent are you on any shipping partner? And can you talk about any initiatives you've had to build out your own shipping network? I know in some countries that you might be over 50% of the stuff you're delivering. Could talk a little bit about dependency there?
And then secondly, on taxes, can you remind us what happened when Amazon started collecting taxes on your own items in various states? And just kind of overview of your view on collecting third-party sales – taxes from third parties in other states if that were to pass? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. Let me start with transportation. We have a great group of carriers that we use globally and you know who they are. But we're also growing our teams and capabilities to ensure that we can keep up with increased volume on our own, particularly around the holiday season. So that's driven a lot of our expansion of Amazon Logistics. It's driven the creation of sort centers. It's driven the purchase of airplanes to move product between points within our delivery network.
So we will continue to operate with this combination of external partners and internal capability. We like what we see so far with our Amazon Logistics capability. It's well over 50% in some countries, particularly the UK. It helps with again Prime Now and AmazonFresh and a lot of initiatives that we'll see, which again we mentioned the Prime Now is tied in with Whole Foods, now in 10 cities. So we think it's a core competency that we have and we need to have, and we'll continue to invest in that.
Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.
Yeah, and Justin, this is Dave, just on the sales tax piece. Today, on the first-party sales, we collect on our own products in all 45 states that have a state-imposed sales tax. On the 3T piece, we do collect on behalf of our sellers in two states, Washington State as of the first of this year, and then Pennsylvania turned on here on April 1.
So in terms of your question of sort of impact from the first-party piece that's been coming online, many of those states came on over a period of time to get to that 45 total, going back over many years. So yeah, nothing really more to add on that.
I think I would say we do continue to believe that the sales tax issue needs to be resolved at the federal level, and we're actively working with the states, with retailers and Congress to get federal legislation passed. We're not opposed to collecting sales tax within a constitution and permissible system that is both simple and applied evenhandedly.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Melich with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question.
Gregory Scott Melich - MoffettNathanson LLC
Hi. Thanks. So I want to follow up on Prime a little bit. The fee increase, why now? I mean, we've been adding value for a long time, obviously shipping costs are going up. Why is now the right time to have that fee hike, especially since membership looks like the growth numbers are starting to slow?
And tied into that, there's a lot of Alexa mentioning in the release. Could you give us some uptake on the importance of Alexa and basically voice commerce, and so the metrics you get in terms of usage there and the flywheel? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. We always evaluate the price of Prime in all the countries we're in, and we're looking for creative ways to reach the customer. As I mentioned earlier, creation – or excuse me, monthly plans, student plans, et cetera.
So it's really nothing more than looking at the state of the program, the high benefits it's delivering. I mentioned that four years ago when we last increased the price of Prime, you could get 20 million products within two days. Today you could get over 100 million products within two days, and many, many, many products within one day, same day or two hours.
So there's all kinds of new features that we've continually added to the Prime program. It's much different than it was in 2014. This is a reflection of that, that's a better reflection of the cost value of the program.

Sorry go ahead. Our next question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.
John Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you. So the U.S. international revenue mix, ex-Whole Foods and ex-AWS looks about 64%, 36%. Given investments in the international markets would you envision international kind of closing the gap in the coming years? And what would be the key drivers of the mix shift getting closer to 50-50? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. Yeah I don't want to project relative proportions of the different segments, but what I can say is the international continues to see the same level of investment as we're seeing in North America or have seen in North America.
So when we add benefits, Prime benefits, we're probably adding them at an earlier stage of life in the Prime program internationally than we did in the U.S. So, they have different dynamics. We think at the end of the day customers behave the same globally and that they value low prices selection and great customer experience.
So, we'll continue to make these investments in Prime. We'll continue to expand selection, continue to build FBA programs so that it increases selection even more and builds great partnerships with sellers. We'll continue to accelerate shipping. We'll continue to lower prices.
And sorry, I cut out the last person [Technical Difficulty] (30:50-30:55) including Alexa, which we think has great stickiness with, in the home and I think creates a lot of value in the home and also allows you to access over time Amazon products better.
We'll continue to invest in India where we're seeing great progress with both sellers and also customers. And we like the momentum we've seen there. The Prime program started in the first year in India grew faster than any Prime program we've seen in other countries. We're adding local content in India, video content, excuse me. We're also adding other benefits, Prime benefits. We're rolling out devices there, and we're seeing Indian developers developing skills for Alexa, and Alexa is up, as you saw in the press release, to 40,000 [Technical Difficulty] (31:46-31:51). Yes, but it's – it is important to us that they all are still delighting customers and growing to the best of their ability.

Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2017 Financial Results Teleconference. [Operator Instructions]. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.
Dave Fildes
Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2017 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2016. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, February 1, 2018, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
I'd also like to update you on the impact of the recent U.S. tax reform legislation. In our fourth quarter results, we recorded a provisional tax benefit for the impact of the new tax legislation of approximately $789 million, which is primarily driven by the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liabilities, resulting from the permanent reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%. As we complete our analysis of this new legislation, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts. Those adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made. 
With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Mahaney
I'd like to focus on the North American retail operating margins. That 4.5% was the highest, I think, we've seen in a couple of years, maybe the highest since you've actually broken that segment out. So could you just go through the drivers behind that? I know you called out Alexa as being better than expected. Was that one of the factors? Was it the full quarter of the Whole Foods impact? Was it advertising revenue? Just what drove that result and how sustainable is it?
Brian Olsavsky
Sure, Mark. Let me address your question by answering the entire company on noteworthy North America elements are strongest. So for the quarter, we came in at the highest end of our revenue range, $60.5 billion, 26 -- 36% FX-neutral growth and 25% FX-neutral growth, excluding the Whole Foods acquisition. So the fact that we came in at the high end of the range, volume was high, especially in North America, and a lot of times in Q4 and other quarters actually, we see better efficiencies when the warehouses were busy. So it's a very clean operational quarter, I would say. The ops team did a great job handling record volumes in Q4 and also incorporating all the new capacity we had opened in 2017. If you remember, we have added over 30% to our fulfillment square footage in 2017, coming off the similar increase in 2016. So amid all these opening of new buildings, many of them late in the year, the ops team did a fantastic job. 
Advertising was also a key contributor as we're continuing to make more value -- the offering's more valuable, both to customers and advertisers alike, and that was particularly strong in North America, although not in the North America segment. I would also point out, AWS had a strong quarter, accelerating growth versus Q3 and also expanding operating margins by 100 basis points. So particularly in North America, I would say there's the volume -- the strong volume -- top line volume, combined with increased advertising revenues and also very clean operational performance. Obviously, there's a lot of things that can happen in Q4 from weather to demand patterns changing. We've seen additional costs creep in, in the name of customer experience in prior years, and this was, in hindsight, probably one of the cleaner Q4s recently.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with J.P. Morgan.
Douglas Anmuth
Brian, I was hoping you could talk about how you're thinking about your primary investment areas in 2018 and perhaps if you could put it in context of '17. There things that are notably different this year relative to last year and also, how you think about the margin trajectory relative to what we saw last year.
Brian Olsavsky
Sure. I will be giving you guidance quarter by quarter, but I can talk to the general trends in the large investment areas. Let me start with AWS infrastructure and the growth in technical and sales teams. That will continue. We're [indiscernible] $20 billion run rate in top line revenues for AWS, up from 18% -- actually $18 billion last quarter. So we're very happy with both the progression in new services and features that we've been able to bring to customers and also their response with continued geographic expansion and continuing to again build on our tech teams and our sales teams. So that would -- that expense is going to continue and likely increase. Prime benefits will continue to increase as well. Prime Now -- excuse me, Prime Video, Prime Now, AmazonFresh, all of our major Prime benefits, we continue to expand globally.
Devices, as Jeff said in the press release, we are very happy with the results of Alexa. It's a very positive surprise for us both on a -- adding a little bit more to that, we had record device sales with very high levels of customer engagement, including increased levels of voice shopping, growth in functionality, growth in our partner, partners we work with, skills that we've increased rapidly, we're over 30,000 skills for Alexa. We've got 4,000 plus smarthome devices from 1,200 unique brands. So that -- the relationships we're having with external companies is actually helping to accelerate the adoption of Alexa with customers. So really strong usage of -- excuse me, Alexa with our devices. Obviously Echo, Echo Show and the Echo family all directly tied to Alexa, but also Fire TV and tablets and we're seeing more and more engagement. Alexa usage on Fire TV is up 9x year-over-year.
Music listening time on Alexa was 3x higher this holiday season. So that's what we mean when we said far exceeding our expectations. Those are the things that I would point to. And that is an area again where we'll continue to invest heavily, and as you say, double down on that. Fulfillment, again, is -- fulfillment capacity, especially the fuel strong top line growth and growth in Amazon fulfilled the units, which, again, is growing much quicker than our unit growth rate. We expect that and hope that to continue as well into 2018. Video content, we spoke about on the last call. We do like the results we're seeing with engagement on customers, their buying habits, their engagement with the Video content, their use of it on devices and we will continue to increase our budget in that area. But I'd be really -- I'd incorporate that into the guidance each quarter as we move through the year.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays.
Ross Sandler
Hey guys, just two questions. AWS reaccelerated again this quarter. Can you just give us some color on what are the key drivers there? Was it lapping some of the price activity from a year ago? Was it higher utilization, moving up the stack? Any color there would be helpful. And then a question on shipping costs. So it looks like it grew about 31% up on shipping costs in the quarter, and that's been kind of moving in tandem with the Amazon fulfilled unit growth. Is that the right way to think about it? It looks like it might be getting a little bit of leverage in the model right now what's driving that, the shipping cost leverage?
Brian Olsavsky
Sure. Let me start with that last one. Yes, the shipping costs are going to be very tied to AFN unit growth and also the impact often greater Prime adoption and faster shipping methods. So we consider that a very strong quarter as down sequentially in the growth that we've seen recently. That will fluctuate quarter to quarter. Again, it was a very strong operational quarter in Q4, and we've expanded the number of items that shipped free. There are now over 100 million items in the U.S. So shipping cost is always going to be a strong part of our offering, and we're -- it's going to be increasing due to our business model, and we, at the same time, look then to minimize the cost by getting more and more efficient in that area, AWS, yes, if you remember last year, we did have price increases in December of last year towards the end.
So it had a partial impact on the quarter. But generally, just strong usage growth -- usage growth continues to be strong growing at a higher rate than our revenue growth rate, and customers continued to add workloads and expand. And as I said, we're adding new services and features all the time, over 1,400 in 2017 alone. So it's a number of factors, I would say. It's not as simple as lapping a cost error -- excuse me, price decrease last year, but we're very happy with the performance in the AWS business. Now over a $20 billion run rate.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi.
Mark May
Brian, if you look back historically, your Q1 operating income guidance is typically about $300 million, $400 million lower than your Q4. Obviously, it's significantly greater than that this quarter. Maybe if you could shed a little light on why that is so and what are some of the key drivers there. And AWS and cloud pricing appears to have been more subtle in the recent quarters. Maybe if you could talk a little bit about the pricing environment and why that has been the case at least compared to trends from back in '14, '15, previously.
Brian Olsavsky
Sure. Let me start with guidance. So yes, the operating income guidance is $300 million to $1 billion. Operating income last year was $1 billion. Q1 is generally when we see the volume drop off from Q4 obviously, but a lot of the cost remain from the year-over-year build up in cost, particularly in the fulfillment network. So it's generally a headwind every Q1. It's -- given the 30% plus growth in square footage last year that we've built, that's 1 major headwind from Q4 to Q1. But we also continue to invest, particularly in Alexa and our device area. As I mentioned in a number of comments earlier, we're very happy with the results, the customer adoption, the device sales that we're seeing and the general customer acceptance there. So we will continue to invest there. That's probably the 2 largest factors in Q1, I would say.
Dave Fildes
This is Dave. Just on the second piece on pricing. I think on the pricing environment, nothing really to call out there. I guess, just a reminder on our pricing philosophy for AWS, I mean periodic price reductions are a normal part of our business where reduced prices more than 60x with AWS since launching. So really, our kind of goal philosophy here is to drive efficiencies in our ops and pass those savings on to customers, and some of that's through, again, with the more than 60 price reductions, but also finding through new service and future launches, better options for customer that -- customers to present more efficient features for them to be able to run their businesses.

Our next question comes from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets.
Daniel Salmon
First, Brian, any comments on the impact of ASC 606 accounting changes on your first quarter guidance here? And then just second on the advertising business, in particular, the ads that we see in the search results on the site, you have line search product sponsored ads, do you aim for certain particular ad load across the entire platform? Do you look at sort of tailoring it based on users activity, maybe a combination of both? I would just be interested in your thoughts on that.
Dave Fildes
Yes, this is Dave. I'll take the first part of that question just around the new revenue recognition standard. We did adopt a new standard in January 1 of this year, 2018, and you'll see that reflected in our financials for the first quarter coming up. There are -- it touches on a number of different parts of our business in terms of how we recognize revenue in terms of any aggregate, the impacts to our expectations for the revenue guidance for the first quarter. It's not material. There's a number of different areas, at least, that we've called out in our filings with the 10-Q in the past and the 10-K that will be on file shortly that talk about the different areas that are impacted us. But again, not material in the aggregate.
Brian Olsavsky
And on advertising, I would say our strategy is to make the customer experience additive by the ad process. We want customers to be able to see new brands and have easier time discovering products that they're looking for. For brands, we think the value proposition is that we can find ways for them, especially emerging brands, to reach new customers. So we're working with advertisers of all types and sizes to help them reach our customer base and the goal of driving brand awareness, discovery and better purchase decisions by the customer.
Operator
Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post
I think I have two questions. First, your Whole Foods, you've got over a quarter under your belt. How's it going versus your expectations? And what can Amazon really bring now that you've been there for a while, how are you thinking about that? And then secondly, your international decelerated a little bit this quarter, just wondering if there was any country to call out or anything going on there? And we know that you spent about $3 billion on International investment, I guess, last year. Where do you think the high watermark is on that? So just maybe a little more color on your international about business.
Brian Olsavsky
Sure. Let me start with the Whole Foods question. We're continuing to be very excited about the opportunities we have to innovate with the Whole Foods and Amazon teams together. In our physical stores, it feels there are supplemental disclosure that physical stores revenue was $4.5 billion in Q4, which is primarily comprised of Whole Foods and was slightly better than what was built into our guidance that I gave you last call. So, so far, our focus has been on continuing to lower prices even beyond the initial ones that we discussed at the close of the deal in late August. We've launched Whole Foods products on our Amazon website, and we're -- the technical work continues to make Prime the Whole Foods customer rewards program and we expect to have more on that later in the year.
We've also added Lockers, and much more to come. So we're very happy with the initial results out of the team in Whole Foods down in Austin. Also, I will mention that we did see a small operating income loss for the quarter from Whole Foods. At the time of the acquisition, we had stepped up the fair market value of certain assets on the balance sheet. This is going to increase the amortization. It's a noncash charge, but it will increase the amortization over the useful life, and a lot of that is forward frontloaded, so we'll see higher amortization in the first few years, and then it reverse later. So excluding this noncash expense items, Whole Foods had a positive operating income in Q4, but you'll see in the 10-K that the operating income, including the charges, was slightly negative in Q4. International growth, your comment about slowing down, I think there's a slowdown versus Q3, if that was your point. 28% growth in Q3, FX neutral, was helped quite a bit by Prime Day and kind of the strengthening of Prime Day in a number of locales.
Although we've had Prime Day in most of those countries, it's really starting to gain more and more traction there. So that is probably more of a help to Q3 than a discussion of any weakness in Q4. So we're -- continue to be pursuing the same strategy as we have in North America, adding Prime benefits, adding devices, adding video content, adding AmazonFresh, Prime Now, giving a lot of value to the Prime customers in the international countries as well and also in that numbers. In India, India continues to be a good story for us. We feel that it's had a lot of growth in the past year. In fact, more Prime members joined India's Prime program in the first year than we've seen in any other country in the history of the world, our world. So the selection is also increasing Prime eligible selection is up over 25 million items, launching Video there and also continuing to add other Prime benefits such as Prime Music will be coming soon, Amazon Family is there, as I said, Prime Video, and we had our first Prime Day in India. So that's a little bit on international growth.
Operator
Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.
Brian Nowak
I have two. First one, in the press release, you talked about the strength of the Prime member growth in 2017. Could you talk a little bit about to the -- what you're seeing in growth in Prime subscribers in the United States at this point? And are you still seeing a similar tick up in consumer spending as they come into Prime as you have in the past? And the second one , Brian, to go back to an earlier question on areas of investment this year, you didn't talk a whole lot about kind of new categories to expand into beyond the old retail business. I'd be curious to hear about your investment needed to go into logistics, health care and kind of new areas you haven't really cracked into as hard yet.
Dave Fildes
Yes, this is Dave, thanks for the answer the question, Brian. Just on the first piece, in terms of just Prime membership and Prime behavior, we continue to see that we're seeing sign-ups from memberships at a strong clip. When we look at the year-over-year growth in paid Prime members on a global basis, it's been consistent in Q4 year-over-year, similar growth rates year-over-year to what we've seen in some of the earlier quarters of this year. So that's, of course, a mix of strength in the U.S. and also strength in some of the newer markets that we've launched or introduced the Prime program in. We continue to see that as Prime members sign up and engage into the program, their purchasing patterns of change and they do spend more as they move into the program. And of course, our focus is -- continues to be on adding some of the features around Prime that Brian's been talking about, but also importantly, making sure we're adding more selection to the offering through our own efforts, first party, but also programs like Fulfillment by Amazon, which continues to be a fast grower for us.
Brian Olsavsky
Yes, and on new businesses or expansion of categories, as you discussed, I would not talk to anything that's not been publicly announced, but on some of the ones you mentioned, they are underway and are continuing. I've said logistics, we will continue to build our logistics capability both -- and that will be all the way to end delivery. We've been able to increase service levels in many cases by delivering ourselves. And although we have a strong partner network here, we will always be able to leverage our strength and our knowledge about where shipments are going, both within our network and to final customers that will create opportunities for us there as we increase or better the customer experience as well.
I would say on the category side, that the biggest effort will be on continuing to be on groceries and consumables with the Whole Foods acquisition and again, we continue to look at our whole offering of AmazonFresh, Prime Now, Whole Foods, how can they work together to create better and better offerings for our customer base. And to a lesser extent, versus grocery, I would say we continue to build our business, B2B businesses, and very happy with the initial performance there with a number of the companies and universities that we've been working with and their initial results.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.
Scott Mushkin
Hey, guys, so I wanted to go back to, and I think you said one of the biggest focuses of the year is going to be on the consumables now, Fresh, Whole Foods. There's been a lot of press on the Whole Foods front, the out-of-stock issue and then clearly, in the Now, as we've been testing it, the Fresh has the same issue. So I was wondering if you guys could talk about what the company plans to do. I mean, there is obviously the reputational risk that could come from that to kind of correct some of these issues and kind of what the view of the company is on the out-of-stock issues. Not just the Whole Foods but just generally across the consumables business in Fresh and Now.
Brian Olsavsky
Yes, let me just back it to a more general statement. I'd say Whole Foods is not less in their commitment to providing the best selection of high-quality products and having them in stock for customers. We've made no changes post acquisition that would have impacted anything related to in stock, except perhaps the fact that the price decreases have brought up demand and there's an amount of rebalancing related to that. So I think the out-of-stock issue is that -- may be getting press or tied more to the increased demand that we're seeing and also selective weather-related restocking issues.
But stepping beyond any short-term issues, the commitment is -- remains to have healthy, high-quality selection in stock for products. That's what the Whole Foods team is committed to. That's what the Amazon team, with them, is committed to, and also across any delivery channel that we have, AmazonFresh, Prime Now or Whole Foods. So where there's issues, they'll be corrected. Where there's areas we can improve our selection and delivery for customers, we'll do so. But it be something we're working on. So the immediacy, the perishability are all challenges everyone has in this area, but we're confident that we will have a good service and continue to delight customers.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
Youssef Squali
We've seen that the number of private label products on the site has increased pretty dramatically over the last 12 to 18 months. Could you speak to your private label strategy, in general? How big is that segment today? How big can it become? And just broadly speaking, how are the margins in that segment versus comparable third-party products?
Dave Fildes
Yes, thanks for the question. This is Dave. I think broadly, when we look at our strategy, it's focused on, number one, providing a broad selection for customers across a number of categories, so that they can find and buy exactly what they're looking for. When you look at private brands, it's very much meant to supplement that great selection, and we look for ways to be able to find private label items that have a high-caliber of quality, but also can bring that selection and that convenience for customers and really supplement what vendors and sellers are already providing the customers in many cases. We've not broken out kind of how significant or how large that is. I think for a lot of these initiatives, when you look across categories that would offer, many of them are still earlier stage and have been around even from kind of infancy for shorter period of time, a year, a couple of years, in some cases.
Amazon Fashion is one area where you're seeing us offer a number of private apparel brands and some of the more popular lines with customers things like Good Threads, Amazon's Essentials, which is men's and women's basics; consumables, is, of course, another big area where we have the benefit of working with some of the Whole Foods private label, but also doing some of our other Amazon brands, things like Happy Belly and [indiscernible] Prime and others. So I think we'll continue to iterate on those and try to find different areas. And certainly there's other verticals that I didn't mention there that we're interested in continuing to kind of learn from customers what they want and what they're looking for there, and so we'll keep adding selection.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Ken Sena with Wells Fargo.
Kenneth Sena
Maybe if you could just remind us of the thinking that behind keeping AWS and Retail under 1 corporate structure, and does it make sense given the scale of where AWS is right now? And then -- and I'm sorry if I have a little bit of an echo, I don't know why, but -- and we're hearing from marketers just how important Amazon is to their media strategy, so I don't know if you could just maybe talk about that a little bit more broadly in terms of the approach in your philosophy to that business.
Dave Fildes
Sure, we see a lot of value in all of our businesses. And AWS is a key component, as is the physical consumer business. The -- what I'll point out is, the management team is a common management team. The consumer business, if you will, is, if not the biggest, one of the largest customers of AWS. So we see a lot of commonality there where we, as depending on the position in the company, on the consumer side, the use of AWS is -- has driven great infrastructure efficiencies just like other companies see when they use AWS, turning fixed costs into variable costs and pooling resources and not having a lot of trapped capacity throughout the company and taking advantage of all the new services and features. So as an internal customer, the consumer business is very happy with AWS. And I think AWS is also very benefited by the fact that they have a large internal beta customer that tries out and uses a lot of their products and services. So it's a good combination for a lot of reasons, and we see no reason to change the structure that we have.
Brian Olsavsky
Yes, and sorry, Ken, your second question was?
Kenneth Sena
Yes, the second question was just on the advertising side. And we're just hearing so much more how important Amazon is to broader media budgets. And so just hoping to get maybe a little bit more color just on your approach to the business right now, some of the drivers behind the recent success and just maybe just more of a sort of, as you look out over the next few years, kind of how important do you see this business becoming in the grand scheme of things?
Dave Fildes
Yes, I mean, I think right now, we're really just focused on finding ways to work with those companies, whether it's vendors or sellers that are coming to us, and offer them a great experience on the website and ability to be able to reach customers. So I think there's more to come on that side. As we said, we're definitely seeing some strong growth in our advertising revenues as part of the other revenue line item. And I think we're going to keep building more and new tools based on what we're learning from our customers there to better serve in the future.
Brian Olsavsky
Yes, I think we're also point of a key lien in from brands and agencies into the e-commerce marketing space. So it's other side, search or social marketing, it's really helping them engage customers on a high, efficient, highly efficient manner.
Dave Fildes

Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q3 2017 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.
For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.
Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.
Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2017 Financial Results Conference Call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO.
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2016. Our comments in response to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 26, 2017 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe, today, to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict the demand for our goods and services and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
At this time, we will open up the call for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Great. I guess I'll just start with, can you give us your thoughts on the Whole Foods integration, how you see that contributing to the bottom line over time? And then on a quick balance sheet note, we obviously saw the strong AWS results, but unearned revenue doesn't seem to be growing at the rate it was in the past. Maybe comment a little bit on the unearned revenue growth on the balance sheet, why it might be slower than the past? Thank you.
Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.
Yes. Thanks, Justin. This is Dave. I'd also point you to beyond the balance sheet. There's some disclosure to (03:57) unearned revenue as part of the cash flow statement. So when you look at that for the three months ended, around 34%, 35% for (04:05) and, historically, what we've seen with unearned revenue is a big and leading contributor (04:12) signing up, paying $99 upfront and having that (04:18). That continues to be the biggest absolute contributor to what you see there. The other area that's been growing over the past few years is Amazon Web Services (04:30) instances where those customers can pay for services upfront in some cases and discounts over multi-year periods.
What we're seeing more recently, I think, is on the Prime piece. We launched month-to-month Prime last year and if you think about how that works, customers are paying $10.99 per month as they go, so there's less that's deferred. So that's, I think, one of a number of factors. So, there's obviously other mix factors going in there besides the pieces that I just mentioned, but we have seen that monthly Prime has been a good driver of getting more members into the program. So, that's part of what you're seeing.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
And your question about Whole Foods, we're really excited to have them as part of the team now after the acquisition in late August. What you see in the financial results for this quarter is, it's shown actually in the new physical stores revenue component, $1.3 billion of revenue, $21 million of operating income. And that's where you'll be seeing the Whole Foods revenue showing up. In addition, that is, the cost of revenue, physical stores revenue is going to be where we're going to book any sales where the customer physically selects an item in a store. So, it will also include, or does include our Amazon Books.
But if you step back on Whole Foods, again, I think we've had busy months since we've joined forces, offering lower prices on a range of key grocery items in the stores, launching the Whole Foods private label products on Amazon, the technical (06:07) work to make Prime the Whole Foods customer rewards program, and we'll have that coming out in the future. We've added Amazon Lockers to select Whole Foods stores. So lots of activity, lots of energy and we're really excited to show customers what's possible when we join forces here.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great. I guess I'll ask two as well. The first one is that was a bit of unusual upside to your guidance, even stripping out Whole Foods. What most surprised you in the quarter? You have been pretty consistent on how you reported versus your guide, so something unusual happened or somewhat unusual happened, what would you attribute that to?
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. In Q3, yes, I would say we had a very strong Prime Day. As you know, we talked about that on the last call. But it really carried into the quarter. We had a record day for sign-ups for free trials for Prime in Prime Day globally, had a very strong Prime Day in particular internationally. So, it really got a lot more traction in this, the third year that we've had it. So I would point mostly to those factors. It was also a very strong quarter for AWS.
Revenue growth was the same as Q2, and now we're at an $18 billion run rate, whereas last quarter when I had this call, we were at $16 billion, so very pleased with the customer response in the AWS business as well. And usage growth is actually growing a lot higher than revenue growth. So particularly pleased with the new customers that we've added and the additional workloads that we've picked up from existing customers.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
And then, briefly, on the international retail, that growth also by itself was intrinsically stronger than you've seen in a while. Any particular markets, geographic markets, you would call out there?
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Yeah, I would – yeah, it was pretty strong across the board. We had the impact of Souq obviously, this quarter internationally and the Diwali holiday in India was a few days earlier, which maybe pushed some sales into Q3 versus Q4. But generally, it was the strength of Prime Day internationally, and it carried through the quarter, but generally, I would point to the increased selection.
A lot of the building blocks that we've been working on, all the Prime benefits, advancements in free shipping offers or faster shipping offers, the Prime benefits would drive engagement, of course, adding selection, adding Fulfilled by Amazon partners and the selection that they bring. So again, I wouldn't point to anything other than the Prime Day pickup, but it was stronger than probably I anticipated.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Thank you, Brian.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Just on Whole Foods again, I was wondering could you talk about one or two of the biggest surprises you've seen so far? And then maybe just the strategic opportunities you see of having a brick-and-mortar presence as you look to continue to grow your overall business. And the second one, on the subscription revenue, you accelerated to 59%. Could you just talk about which countries or which regions are driving that? And maybe talk a little bit about the growth or the cadence of what's happening in the U.S., your oldest market? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. On Whole Foods, I would say it is early. August 28 was the close date and what I can tell you is I have been in meetings with John Mackey and his team, and they are very like-minded with us, customer-obsessed, ready to work together to continue their mission and expand on their offerings that we can offer customers.
The other things I mentioned, price reductions early on, selling their products on Amazon.com and also installing Amazon Lockers. I think over time, you'll see more cooperation and working together between AmazonFresh, Prime Now, and Whole Foods as we can explore different ways to serve the customer. So, that's kind of the early report on Whole Foods. So far so good, and we're thrilled to finally be working together after the summer of closing the deal.
On subscription revenue, let me just remember your question there. We had essentially 59% growth, as you said, 600 basis points higher than Q2. In this line item, is certainly the fees associated with Amazon Prime and also it's where a lot of our subscription services for digital music, digital video, audiobooks, e-books, so there's some moving parts in there.
The growth in Prime has been fairly consistent over the last recent quarters in Prime memberships, and as I said, we had the largest new sign-ups on Prime Day for the Prime program. The monthly program is gaining traction and is an attractive option for a lot of people. And again, on the other subscription services, music especially, it works just so well with our Echo device that we're seeing a lot of growth in that area as we increase the number of Echo devices and customers using the Echo devices.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question. In the comment in the release on seasonal workers, that looks roughly flat year-on-year. I wanted to know if you could understand a little bit more about the trajectory around the workers needed to fulfill seasonal holiday demand and what that might also mean for automation or efficiency benefits you're getting inside your fulfillment centers? Thanks so much.
Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.
Yes, Eric, this is Dave. I think we put out a release, I think, earlier this quarter talking about 120,000 operations folks to bring into our fulfillment centers this year. So, we're continuing to hire and hire across a number of locations. We talked earlier this year about expecting to see a greater than or – roughly or greater than 30% square footage growth in operations. So, we're certainly hiring to support that. More of these facilities do have Amazon Robotics and certainly that helps with the efficiencies there, but it requires a tremendous effort from a number of our folks as well, and so we'll continue to hire there.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
While we're on this subject of head count, head count grew 77% year-over-year in the quarter. That includes the impact of the Whole Foods and Souq acquisitions. Without those, without that head count, the base Amazon grew 47%, which is still up from 42% in Q2. So a lot of the additional pickup in Q3 was tied to our ramp for the holidays. We continued to hire a lot of software engineers. We continued to hire a lot of sales reps and it's tied directly to our major investment areas of AWS, Prime Video and devices.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question. Brian, I was hoping you could help us understand how, at this point, you're prioritizing expansion into new product categories. In particular, there's a lot of talk now about potentially using Whole Foods stores for a physical pharmacy presence and also that you've perhaps gotten approvals across multiple states in that category. Can you just help us understand the approach in general to new categories and pharmacy in particular? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Yeah, I can't confirm or deny any of the rumors related to pharmacy or anything else. I will say we do see a lot of opportunity with Whole Foods. As I said, there will be a lot of work together between Prime Now, AmazonFresh, Whole Foods, Whole Foods products on the Amazon site, Amazon Lockers at the Whole Foods stores. So, there will be a lot of integration, a lot of touch points and a lot of working together as we go forward. And we think we'll be also developing new store formats and everything else just as we talked about in the past before Whole Foods. Amazon Books stores, Amazon Go, and the opportunity that that technology presents. We have on campus bookstores.
So, we are experimenting with a lot of formats. I think that Whole Foods really gives us a vast headstart on that and a great base. And a great team to work with who has a lot of history and a lot of – they probably have 10 years to 20 years of learnings that we don't have and wouldn't have. So, we're really excited about that and I think working together, will bring our different strengths to the table and really be able to build on behalf of customers.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great. Thank you, Brian.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thank you. The other category which includes advertising accelerated 58% in the quarter. I think the common view there is that that's a fairly high margin business, certainly higher than corporate average. Is there any reason why that isn't the right assumption to make? Essentially what impact is the growth in the ad business having on the company's overall profitability? And in terms of the increased losses in the international retail segment of the business, can you provide some color around how much of that's being driven by Amazon launching into new markets, which I know you continue to do, versus investing more heavily in existing markets?
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. Let me start with the revenue. So you're right, other revenue grew 58% in the quarter. And that includes advertising services and other things such as our cobranded credit card agreements. Advertising revenue continues to grow very quickly and its year-over-year growth rate is actually faster than the other revenue line item that you see there. But I would say, generally, we're very pleased with the advertising business. Our goal here is to be helpful to consumers and help them make better shopping and selection choices. We'll also provide – and giving them targeted recommendations, so making it helpful for customers rather than intrusive.
And then we believe that by creating that growth (17:19) and engaging advertising experience with the customers, it will also maximize success for our advertisers. So, it's an important part of the flywheel and so it's the traffic and the customers, especially the Prime customers that come to the site, are really the ones that we can use to help them select items and use advertising to help make their decisions more informed when they're picking products.
On the international, yeah, I can't split it, the effects, but I will tell you again, it is international expansion and primarily in India where we're continuing to add benefits. And we launched Prime there a year ago, if you remember, and we've had more Prime members join in India than in any other country in the first 12 months. We have free shipping on 10 million items there and we're continuing to add benefits; Prime Video, Amazon Family.
We had the first Prime Day there this year, Prime Music, Amazon Business is also expanding in India. So, a lot of positive momentum and investment going on in India, very pleased with that. We also recently announced Echo and Alexa are available in India. So that should be well received by the Indian consumer base.
But excluding India and Souq, the rest is the Prime benefits and the continued growth in the other countries that we have been in for a while, continue to roll out Prime Now and AmazonFresh. In video, if you remember in Q4 of last year, we launched Prime Video in over 200 countries globally, continue to build up not only the offerings, but also the engagement that we see from those Prime customers.
So becoming more engaged and we're also doing the basic blocking, tackling of adding selection, especially FBA selection, increasing free shipping offers and also speed of shipping offers. So, there's a lot of different influences there. You saw the growth rate. We believe that it's resonating with customers. So, we will continue to invest and think that we have a good path forward.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hey, guys. Two questions. There's been some news flow recently about Brazil expansion. Can you just talk about how Brazil compares to maybe some of the other international markets that you're investing in? What level of investment should we expect in Brazil maybe relative to like in Australia or in India?
And then a follow-up on the Whole Foods, so do you feel like the store footprint at 460 odd scores is adequate? Or any color on plans to expand either the Whole Foods store footprint or the Amazon Books stores or those other ones you mentioned? Thank you.
Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.
Yeah, Ross. Thanks for the question. This is Dave. On Brazil, just briefly, yeah we did recently expand and add an electronics category there in Brazil. It's a third-party marketplace offering. You may recall we've been in Brazil for a number of years now, initially launched with really a Kindle and e-books offering without the sort of physical categories and, more recently, added physical books again, a third-party marketplace offering.
So, I think, we're excited about the electronics getting out there. There is a wide variety of products included in that category: smartphones, tablets, cameras, TVs, what have you. So, I think, we're really excited to get that technology out there for Brazilians. And I think beyond that, we really just focus on those categories and growing selection there, but I can't speculate on what we might do in the future there.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
And on Whole Foods, yes, I believe the total is 465 stores or thereabouts. And we have 12 bookstores now. We are adding a few more in the near future in California, Washington DC, and Austin. So, yeah, you will see more expansion from us. We're not ready to announce what that will look like and we are working with the Whole Foods team on how many more stores we might have in that area. But still early, so those plans will develop over time.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks, Brian. I understand you can't comment on rumors one way or the other but curious, as you think about categories like health care and, obviously, you guys are already in health care to some degree through Amazon Business, can you give us a bit of a status update on what you do have out there now? And particularly how the company and management thinks about entering more regulated businesses over time, how you would approach that versus a standard category that you might go into or maybe again knowing you can't comment on rumors, how you have approached that in the past or in other markets.
And then to the extent that we're thinking about AWS growth in the fourth quarter, you guys are lapping the price cuts from last year and, obviously, have about an 800-basis-point easier comp Q3 to Q4, taking those two things into consideration, how should we think about AWS growth through the end of the year?
Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.
Yeah, Heath. This is Dave. I'll take that first question in relation to health care. I think where you're seeing us do some work in that, I think, is on the areas of Amazon Business, and that's really just from the standpoint of there are many different types of businesses that we can serve with that offering, and we're in our third year now, and so there's a lot of different sectors, whether they are hospitals, educational institutions, labs, government agencies, I mean, there's a lot of different shapes and sizes across industries that we can serve with that.
And so, I think what you're seeing us do is really focus on services that meet those businesses multi-user accounts, improving approval workflow tools and just more recently, we introduced Amazon Business for Business Prime Shipping, which we think will be a great way for businesses to use multiuser – business customers have multiuser accounts, and that's in the U.S. and Germany. So, I think it's part of that offering, and we will really have to see how that evolves. And the other side, too, is certainly health care is one of many sectors as part of Amazon Web Services that are important customers that we are focusing on and building tools for. So probably nothing specific to call out on that one, but that's a lot of what you're seeing from us today.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Yeah, on AWS, we don't provide segment level estimates, but we did consider in our guidance the impact of the price cuts last year. You're right, we had a number of price cuts timed about around December 1 of last year. That certainly had an impact on Q4 of last year. But again, price cuts and not only price cuts but new products that have lower average cost and can cannibalize more expensive products is pretty much a part of our business all the time in AWS. So we're looking forward to a strong Q4 and re:Invent is in December or the end of November, early December, so that is also an exciting time of year for the AWS business.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Devitt with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
Scott William Devitt - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Hi. Thanks. I had two, please. First, Prime Now, Fresh, Prime Pantry, and Whole Foods, they're all distinct offerings, but it does seem like there's natural overlap with the potential to be further connected. And I was just wondering if you could just speak to how we should think about those four as distinct product offerings in the future versus being more integrated and possibly even in some cases, eliminated to remove overlap from a customer experience standpoint.
And then secondly, given the recent management changes in video, Brian, I was just wondering if you could speak to any strategic shifts in video or changes in the pace of content portfolio build in coming years? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. Let me start with video. And I just want to be clear. We're going to continue to invest in video and increase that investment in 2018. And why are we going to do that? It's because the video business is having great results with our most important customer base, which is our Prime customers. It continues to drive better conversion of free trials, higher membership renewal rates for existing subscribers and higher overall engagement. We're seeing the engagement go up year-after-year in video and also music and a lot of the other Prime benefits. We also know Prime members who watch video also spend more on Amazon.
And we have a lot of data where that's the advantage we have is that we see the viewing patterns, and we also see the sales patterns, so we can tie the two together and understand which video resonates with Prime members, which video doesn't, and make mid course corrections. So we always do that. We're always changing the emphasis and looking for those more impactful shows, more shows that resonate better with our customer base, and things they want to see. So that will always be an important part of our Prime offer, and we'll continue to use the data that we have to make better and better decisions about where to invest our dollars in Prime Video. So we remain very bullish on the video business, and we're looking forward to a lot of interesting new projects at the back-end of this year and also lined up into next year.
On the, sorry, the second comment was, oh, the overlap. Yes. So Whole Foods, I think I mentioned this earlier, but we definitely see commonality and overlap with the Whole Foods business as well as Amazon in total, but specifically Prime Now and also AmazonFresh. And we're going to work to see how we expand those offerings, and in some cases combine them. We're not sure how it'll play out.
But we're going cooperate across those different customer touch points and trying to make them better for customers. We know customers are going to buy, just like in the physical world, sometimes you go to a convenience store, sometimes you go to a supermarket, sometimes you go to a superstore. Sometimes you need things within an hour, sometimes you can wait days for shipments. So there's no one paradigm for all customer engagement, and we're looking for the ones that resonate best with customers and we're going to continue to work on those.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.
Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Thanks. I'll actually ask two, if I can. Just any way you can comment on the increase in Whole Foods traffic after the close? And then second, talk about your desire to have an ad supported business on Fire TV or through Prime Video? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Let me start on traffic. So we're not disclosing traffic figures. Whole Foods will be issuing a final 10-K early next month. So you'll see a better perspective on the entire quarter. The quarter that, or the four week period that you see running through the Amazon P&L this quarter is pretty hard to draw conclusions on other than revenue at this point. But Dave, do you have more on the...?
Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.
Yeah, Jason, this is Dave. On the ad supported question, I think what you've seen to-date is really particularly as you're looking as a customer, as a Prime Video member and watching content, we view that as you've paid into that service and able to watch those shows ad free. There may be instances where you're viewing a first episode and there's an ad leading into that if it's the first free episode, but generally we like to have that as customers have paid into that program and they'll be able to enjoy that without interruption.

Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Ronald V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC
Great. Thanks for the question. Just wanted to ask about delivery and just over the last several months, we've seen a lot of announcements and products around delivery options between Lockers, the testing of the Kohl's partnership, Whole Foods obviously, Amazon Key came out recently, just wanted to better understand this investment. Is this a result of, or the thesis that more options could drive obviously more sales on the flip side, do you think you're losing sales by not having those options? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Probably a little of both. We think that especially as we get into more and more Amazon Logistics deliveries, we're going to experiment with different ways to deliver things that make it easier on consumers, things that cut down on potential theft on doorsteps, but really it's mostly about increasing convenience for them.
Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.
Yeah. I think that's right. In terms of overall investments there.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
And the other investments obviously are on the -maybe on the bigger-ish things or like planes and transportation capacity in general. There our philosophy is, again, we are going to watch out for our customers, we're going to build capacity that gives them great service 12 months a year but particularly at holidays. By investing in those transportation options, we do so at same cost or cost parity I would say at the very minimum.
But it also allows us to do interesting things like extend cut off times for customers. It enables Sunday delivery, enable better weekend delivery. So we're seeing a lot of benefits, just the ability to stretch the order cut off from what once was 3 PM in the afternoon to midnight. Has huge benefits for both the customer and also for Amazon. It results in incremental sales and it also builds that trust that when you need something, Amazon is going to be there for you. And I need to remind you that the Thursday Night Football Game will start in two hours and 20 minutes, so...
Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.
On that, thanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end the quarter.

Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q2 2017 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.
For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Darin Manney. Please go ahead.
Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.
Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2017 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results to the comparable period of 2016.
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 27, 2017 only, and include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially.
Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements and excludes the impact of our proposed acquisition of Whole Foods Market. It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
At this time, we will open up the call for questions. We ask each caller please limit yourself to one question.
Thank you. Our first question comes from line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you. I was just wondering if you could give us a sense on the investments that are planned in Q3. Previously, you've been willing to provide sort of some qualitative guidance around how you're rank ordering those or in terms of the ones that are the largest areas of investment in the quarter. I'm just wondering if you could update us on that given the guidance for Q3 and what we saw in investment in Q2.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. Let me see what I can tell you on that. First of all, I want to remind you that Q3 is typically a lower operating income quarter as we're preparing for the Q4 holiday peak. The other dynamic is that, similar to last year, a large percentage of our new fulfillment centers are coming online in the second half of the year, a lot of them in Q3. So, to give that some perspective, the Amazon-fulfilled network, or the combination of retail and FBA shipments coming out of our warehouses has been nearly 40%. It was that last year, and it's continued through this year. Last year we added 30% additional square footage to handle that additional shipping volume, and about 80% of that went into service in the back end of last year. And that's what I mentioned about this time last year.
The similar dynamic this year, we are going to have about 80% of our increase in square footage for fulfillment and shipping coming online in the back end of the year, so that's a major increase. The other comment I would make is on the video content. Video content last year, I highlighted the fact that it was going to be a significant step up between second half of 2016 and the second half of 2015. We are still – we lapped that most of the first half this year and we'll also be increasing video spend on a sequential and year-over-year basis in Q3, and that's included in this guidance.
Other than that, can't give much more specifics except to say that the large investment areas remain the increasing fulfillment capacity to service the strong growth of the FBA business. I will also point out that the strong usage growth in AWS has led us to a step up in infrastructure in capital leases to build the capital leases in the trailing 12 months. They've increased 71% through the end of Q2 versus last year. That is servicing – accelerating usage in our largest AWS services as well as geographic expansion. So that's additional factor sequentially in the quarter year-over-year.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Great. Thank you. A question on the grocery category and the announcements that we have – that we heard recently. Specifically, does that imply that the strategy has changed around fresh, which was presumably replacing the trip to the grocery store? Or should we think about adding different modes such as pick up points and bricks and mortar as serving a distinct customer base or geared to reduce the cost bottleneck around home delivery? Any comments would be helpful. Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure, Colin. First, as far as Whole Foods is concerned, as Darin mentioned, it's not included in this guidance since it hasn't closed yet, but we are excited about that acquisition and looking forward to working with the team at Whole Foods. We think they are very customer-centric, just like us. They've built a great business, focus around quality and customer. So we're really glad to join up with them. On your larger question about what the place of Amazon Fresh, likely Prime Now and some of our other efforts, I would say we believe there'll be no one solution, so we're experimenting with a number of the formats from physical pickup points in Amazon Go to online ordering and delivery to your door through Prime Now and Amazon Fresh.
And we'll see how customers respond. We like the response that we've seen so far. We think it's a valuable – all those are valuable services, Amazon Go is not out of beta, but the other ones are. On top of that, we're looking forward to adding the Whole Foods team and their great reputation for quality customer service to this offering.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Yes. A couple of questions. It definitely seems relative to your guidance, you may have stepped up spending in the second quarter. Anything in particular to call out, India or anything like that? And then just thinking bigger picture, I'm wondering why physical locations might make sense for Amazon. Why is that a positive use of capital going forward? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. As far as Q2 is concerned, we were very encouraged by the revenue and unit growth acceleration, particularly in North America. We see that tied to the Prime growth and the adoption of Prime and success of that program. Also point out that AWS stepped up its run rate from a $14 billion run rate last quarter to $16 billion. So we saw the largest quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increase in revenue in that business as well. And gross margin expanded 130 basis points.
So as you point out, the year-over-year difference is primarily driven by investments, what we were within the guidance range and we continue to invest in, as I said, fulfillment capacity and logistics services, digital video, our Echo and Alexa, Echo devices and Alexa platform India, the buildup at the AWS infrastructure, all the things I mentioned not to mention Prime Now and Amazon Fresh and Prime benefits.
We did see a big jump in head count in year-over-year. You'll see it's 42%, and in the past, I'd say most of that is driven by operations hiring. I've even said that headquarters or office hiring many times in the past was below the level of revenue growth. Right now, what we're seeing is an accelerated growth rate in software engineers and also sales teams to support primarily AWS and advertising. So, yes, the growth rate of those two job categories actually exceeded the company growth rate. So we are adding – having success hiring a lot of people and pointing them at some very important programs and customer-facing efforts.
On the place of physical, again, as I mentioned in the earlier question, we are experimenting with a number of formats. You've seen the physical bookstores and I would say that the benefit there is again, we have a curated selection of titles and it's also a great opportunity for people to touch and feel our devices and see them, especially the new Echo devices. I went into the store in Seattle last week and I saw about a third of the people were standing around the device table learning how they work, how they interact with devices. So, I saw firsthand the customer experience, I think, that's what we're seeing as a benefit to the physical stores right now.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thank you. A question on the comments around the fulfillment investments. Could you characterize or maybe even quantify how much of the fulfillment infrastructure investment that you're making is kind of incremental, is geared towards handling growth and sort of the existing business and infrastructure versus expanding your capabilities in fulfillment, like adding more inbound or last mile and/or from entering new international markets where you need to invest ahead of growth versus just sort of keeping up and maintaining growth within sort of your existing footprint? And then AWS, you had some price adjustments in May, yet the Q2 growth was quite good. Can you just comment about the impact that those cuts may have had in Q2 and if you're modeling those also in your Q3 guidance, maybe the impact there? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Yes. Let me start with the second one. So, yes, we've had numerous price decreases, and we continue to have that in the AWS business, both absolute decreases in service costs and also rolling out new services that may be cannibalizing more expensive other services that we provide. So, nothing really to note on Q2 or Q3 from that standpoint. The fulfillment investments, I can't split it out for you between Amazon logistics support sort centers and fulfillment centers. What I can say, the biggest dynamic going on again is that Amazon fulfilled unit growth of nearly 40%, which was last year and carrying into this year.
It's a global number and we are very glad to have the success of the FBA program. We are matching that with just over 30% increase in square footage, and you're right, that does include some shipping sort centers and things that are incremental and new functions for us, if you will. But that's about all I can say on that right now. I think we're very happy with the FBA program. It's impact on Prime and we think Prime and FBA are self-reinforcing. We know customers really like it, the additional selection that FBA provides. So we like those combined, and we are working very hard to match that with capacity in an efficient manner.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on AWS, and just on the back of the price cut, obviously 1Q being the first full quarter, but it looks like 2Q, as Mark said, things did stabilize some. Can you just talk about whether you're seeing more of a volume pickup response here and companies kind of more actively moving volume into the cloud at these lower prices? And then just secondly, on Prime, the value of a Prime subscription for the consumer seems to continue to increase as you add more features in there. Can you just talk about your view around the flexibility of the price of annual Prime subscription? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. On the price of Prime, I have nothing to add at this time. We think that the – we are increasing the value of the Prime program every day. So it becomes more and more valuable and again, as we've said, it's the best deal in retail. On AWS, yes, we are seeing great customer adoption. Again, as I said earlier, the run rate's gone up from $14 billion to $16 billion in Q2, and also we had the largest sequential and year-over-year dollar rise in revenues. Our usage in all of our large services are actually accelerating and they're growing at a rate higher than our revenue growth. So, you're seeing great adoption. We are seeing AWS customers migrate more than 30 databases over the last year-and-a-half.
We signed some very big customer wins, like Ancestry, High Tail, California Polytechnic State University and others, that we're very proud to have. So, yes, the momentum in the business is very strong. We continue to open new regions. We'll be opening five regions in the near future in France, China, Sweden, Hong Kong and a second government cloud region in the East. So, yes, we like the momentum in that business. Stepping back, I would say that while pricing is important, again, we're generally being selected because of our functionality and pace of innovation, the innovation keeps accelerating. It did in the first half of this year, the pace of new services and features. We also know the customers value our partner and customer ecosystem and really the experience we've had, we've been at this longer than anybody else.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. I want to stick with AWS, please. So the AWS revenue growth showed almost no change but the AWS operating margin was lower I guess than we've seen in, I don't know, six quarters or something like that. I find that a little surprising but then I also saw that the tech and content came in materially heavy, I think, versus our and I assume other expectations. So could you just talk about that a little bit, the profitability, if there's anything that's changed in the profitability of AWS? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. Those margins, as we say frequently, are going to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter and always going to be a net of investments, excuse me, price reductions and cost efficiencies that we drive. So I would say the biggest impact in the margin that you're seeing in Q2 is really around the 71% increase in assets acquired under capital leases. Most of that is for the AWS business. So we've really stepped up the infrastructure to match the large usage growth and also the geographic expansion. And that is showing up in tech and content. On the marketing, if you look under the marketing expenses, they are also up, and that is driven by the increases we're seeing in the sales team both in AWS and advertising. So I would point to those two as probably larger than normal impacts on Q2 operating margin.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, as you continue to add more Prime Now markets with one to two-hour shipping, can you just talk to some of the logistical challenges that you've already encountered and worked through? And talk to kind of if you really do see one to two-hour shipping become a larger piece of the business over the next year, what's the biggest challenge you have to make sure that you manage? And the second one on the subscription revenue, it looks like subscription revenue growth was strong again, over 50%. Could you just talk to what drove that acceleration? Was it Prime? Or is there something else in there? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. Let me start with your second question on the subscription revenue. It grew 53% year-over-year versus 52% in Q1. So, we continue to see strong Prime membership growth. That is the main thing. There's also – in that line item are also other monthly fees associated with some of our other subscription services like audiobooks, e-books, digital video and digital music. Again, I would say that we're very happy with the Prime membership growth and it has remained pretty consistent both in Q4 and then through Q1 and Q2 of this year.
On your second question on Prime Now, so Prime Now is now available in 50 cities across eight countries. We do learn. It's something to do in every city and have different – slightly different shapes and sizes of those buildings and different density profiles. And so we are learning as we go, learn as we grow internationally as well. That is a service that customers love. That's not an inexpensive service, though, and we also have – so we're constantly working on our cost of delivery and our route densities. And again, we like what we see and we'll continue to expand that and we'll be working very hard on making that not only a valuable Prime offering, a Prime benefit, but also a lower-cost operation as well.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Hey. Good afternoon, Brian. I think I heard you earlier say that your head count for advertising salespeople is growing faster than the company as a whole, or company's head count growth rate as a whole. I would just like to use that maybe as a springboard to talk a little bit about what you think the right mix is for how you sell in terms of self-service versus salespeople.
And then a second one would just be a quick one. I know it's early, but be curious to see what you're seeing with users of the Echo Show, with the screen on it, and if you're seeing any particularly different type of user behavior there versus the original devices with that one. Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. Yes. It's early on the Echo Show. As you know, we just started shipping those in late June, but we're very excited about the potential and the addition of the video screen and the messaging capability and video capability. So it's – I've used mine, it's awesome. It's a big step up in my mind, but we'll get more customer feedback as we go along. On advertising, technically what I said is the sales force has grown higher than the rate of growth in the business itself, which was 42% regular head count and that sales force is primarily AWS and advertising. So, we built self-service tools and obviously we want to make those as efficient as possible for customers and advertisers, but we realize that we will need actual sales contact with the accounts as well. So it's a mix. I can't get into the split, really, but I would see both growing.

Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe two. One, with respect to international margins, is there anything there you can give us in terms of rank order or color, whether it be geographies or category expansion that we should be thinking about that are driving some of the cost curve in the international side of the business? That would be number one. Number two, stock-based comps stepped up a lot, both quarter-over-quarter and year-on-year. Wanted to know if there was anything either organic or inorganic that was driving that step-up in stock-based compensation. Thank so much.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. I'll start with the second one. Yes, as you noted in the press release or the 8-K, we had an absolute step-up from Q1 of $792 million to Q2 of $1.2 billion. So it increased 51% year-over-year in Q2 versus a head count increase of 42%. I'll also say that we generally see a step-up from Q1 to Q2 because we do our employee RCU grants in Q2 of each year. So that's a normal trend. But the 51% year-over-year is also – it's a combination of the hiring we've done but also an adjustment we made to our estimated forfeiture rate. We're seeing less forfeitures, which is a great sign for our employee retention, but you have to make adjustments to your reserves as you see that. So that was another influence in Q2.
On operating margins internationally, I would step back and say a lot of the investments we're making in North America we're also making in international. Prime benefits including Prime Video and remember we launched Global Video in Q4 of last year to 200 countries, Prime Now, Amazon Fresh, the general rise of FBA and added selection, both retail and FBA to make Prime more attractive, and the fulfillment and logistics costs that go with that, and the additional constant effort to reduce prices and accelerate shipping. So that all impacts both North America segment and international. The North America segment is a little further along in the Prime, excuse me, yes, the Prime membership growth curve. And so in some respects we are giving benefits earlier in the lifecycle to international Prime customers than we did in North America just because it launched later.
And there's also India, as I mentioned, we continue to invest in India. We're very hopeful with the progress we've made with sellers and customers alike in India and we see great momentum and success there, so we continue to invest and we have some of our best people in that business.

Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC
Thanks, guys. You mentioned before just stand of new fulfillment centers, it takes a bit of time for them to ramp optimization. How should we think about that path optimization over a year or so? As you continue to scale operations and you bring data to bear and robotics and Kivas and AI machine learning, are you finding that kind of new fulfillment center optimization curve is accelerating?
Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.
Hi, Brian. This is Darin. Yes. We're getting more efficient every time we put new capacity into the network, whether that's through automation or just through the experience we've gained over the years. We still say it takes up to three years or three peaks to get to kind of network efficiency for a new particular facility, and that's about the same although the whole network gets sufficient over time. So there's a big mix going on, and we like the new innovation that we're bringing to the capabilities, but that ramp still stays about consistent as it was.

Thank you. And our final question comes from line of from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer and Company. Please proceed with your question.
Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Thanks for taking my question. Just one, other slowed from 58% in the first quarter to 53% year-over-year. Anything to call out? And then just you made a comment about physical stores and reaction to one other question that was really about showcasing new devices. Is it fair to say that probably means locations would have small footprints versus large footprints if you're thinking about that? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
I'm sorry. What was the first part of your question?
Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
The other, other revenue slowed from 58% in the first quarter to 53%. Is there anything to call out around that?
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
No, nothing in that other line item. It's advertising and also other things like cobranded credit card agreements. I would say that advertising revenue growth has been strong and fairly consistent over the past three quarters. So that number will move around, but there's other things in it that more the variance and the volatility is in the other line items.
Your question on stores, we are – again, I personally think the new devices, the ability to see new devices is a great asset, but I don't want to shortchange the rest of the bookstore and the ability to have curated selection and the creativity we've had in taking new look at the bookstores. So we are experimenting with different formats, and we look at different sizes and we look at revenue cost per square foot just like any other physical retailer. So, we haven't essentially nailed the model yet, and we continue to experiment to see what works and how it differs by city or more suburban locations.
Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.
So thank you, Brian, and thank you all for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website through at least the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking to you again next quarter.",https://seekingalpha.com/article/4091635-amazon-com-amzn-q2-2017-results-earnings-call-transcript

Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q1 2017 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.
For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Darin Manney. Please go ahead.
Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.
Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2017 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.
Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2016. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 27, 2017, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures.
In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we have seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
Our guidance also assumes among other things that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
Before moving to Q&A, I would like to draw attention to a new accounting rule that we implemented in Q1. The new rule requires excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation to be presented as an operating activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows. We retrospectively adjusted our consolidated statements of cash flows to re-classify excess tax benefits from financing activities to operating activities. And as a result, you will see an increase in our free cash flow measures for prior periods.
Additionally, beginning January 1, 2017, the excess tax benefit or deficiency for stock-based compensation is recognized as a component of tax expense rather than equity. This change resulted in a decrease to our tax expense for the quarter and a corresponding increase to our net income and earnings per share. Specific changes are presented in the footnotes to the consolidated statement of cash flows and related metrics provided in our press release. Further disclosure of the impact of the adoption of this accounting change can be found in our Form 10-Q.
With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question

At this time, we will now open up the call for questions. .
Thank you. Our first question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Got it. I saw on the front page of the release you're really focused on India. Can you give us a progress update on how you're doing? Any thoughts on how far you're willing to take the investment levels there? And what are your thoughts on maybe when international margins can start to make progress? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure, Justin. Thank you. Yes, I think Jeff's comments were pretty dead on. The launch of Prime last year was a big turning point. We've increased Prime selection by 75% since launching that nine months ago in India, also increased the fulfillment capacity for sellers by 26% this year. On the content side, we've announced A-Team in the original TV series and we're customizing the content, so it's a really vast selection of local and global movies and TV shows that are available to the Indian public.
You'll also notice that the Fire TV Stick was – a new version of it was launched in India with some important features there such as the ability to search in Hindi and in English, free data usage for three months and also data monitoring, which is important there. So again, we continue to be encouraged by both the response from customers and sellers. As far as level of investment is concerned, it is certainly one of our important investment areas. We see a lot of potential for the country and our business there.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Any thoughts on how much it is impacting your international profitability?
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. I can't quantify it, or break it out specifically, but I will say it's a large factor as well as a couple other things in the international segment. So, keep in mind that we launched Prime Video in the fourth quarter, and now we have that in over 200 countries and territories.
We're spreading a lot of the Prime benefits that we see in North America to other countries. We just opened up Amazon Fresh in Tokyo last weekend, but also Prime Now. You saw other things like our business B2B business just opened up in the UK. We have Amazon Devices. So there's a lot of moving parts here. The other big influence is the same trends are happening in international with respect to FBA growth and the fact that our Amazon fulfill network, or the units we shipped, are growing at a much faster clip than our paid unit growth.
Last year we said that was a 40% – nearly 40% growth worldwide. So we're making the investments in warehouses, fulfillment capacity and delivery capacity to handle that. So there's a lot going on in international. We are very encouraged with the growth of the Prime program, and we're hopeful for the Prime Video that we launched in the fall.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Two questions. The North American operating margins seem to come down like 70 bps year-over-year, and I know it's not big books view of the margins, I get that. But it's sort of a change. You've had margins be flat or up year-over-year for quite some time, and then they dipped down. Just could you explain that?
And then secondly on these – on the Echo devices, the Echo family, Alexa devices that are coming out, could you comment at all about what kind of impact you're seeing in terms of increased wallet or per share within households? Are you seeing it have an impact in terms of Amazon customers more likely to spend more once they have these devices in particular categories like groceries or household products, pantry products that they're more likely to spend because they have these devices in their houses, in their kitchens, in their living rooms? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure, Mark. Let me start with the Echo question first. So, yeah, we're very encouraged by the customer response to the Echo products. Not only the Echo products but the ability to use tablets, our tablets now as Echo devices, since we've spread the Alexa technology to many of those devices. And we're also happy with the success we've had with developers. There's now over 12,000 Alexa skills. So we think that's all foundational. The monetization, as you might call it, is a theme of your questions.
That's not our primary issue right now. It's about building great products and delighting customers. We think as engagement – as we pick up engagement with the devices, it helps the engagement with Amazon as a whole. So whether someone is ordering off their Alexa device or whether they're going to their phone, or going to their computer, it all has the same effect for us. So, very pleased with the initial progress. We see a lot of momentum there and we continue to invest. And that's one of the answers to your second question on North America operating margin.
So if I step back, let me just talk generally about investments. So right now, we're just seeing a lot of great opportunities before us. And we're continuing to ramp up the investments in pursuit of those opportunities. And the big picture is, again, as we've said customers – the things customers love can grow to be large, we'll have strong financial returns and they're durable and can last for decades.
So in that category, and some of the things that we're investing the most in are as you say the Echo and Alexa devices. We're doubling down on that investment, video content and marketing, not only in the U.S. but globally with the launch of our Prime Video in the fall.
So, we're building global scale in that business in both content and marketing. As I said earlier, we're expanding Prime benefits in the U.S. and also globally. Things like Prime Music, Prime Now, Amazon Fresh, all expanding globally. And we have launched Prime in India, China and Mexico. I know I'm drifting a bit from North America, but it's all part of the same theme. We also have this trend going on in our fulfillment networks where strong FBA growth and high growth in Amazon fulfilled unit is resulting in a large increase in fulfillment capacity.
We're also investing in new technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning. You're starting to see some of that show up in things like Amazon Go, our beta store that we have developed in Seattle, drones. We use those technologies a lot in our internal businesses and we're also developing services for AWS customers. So – and that's of course another area is AWS continues to grow and add services and features and doing so at an accelerating rate. So there's a long list, and I can keep going. But I think the general theme is there's a lot of investment in front of us that we're optimistic about, and we continue to ramp those investments. In North America, that manifests itself mostly in the device area, the content area and also the expansion of the fulfillment networks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, Amazon always had a pretty big focus on efficiencies. I'd be curious if you could talk about examples or areas where you have been able to iron out inefficiencies in the fulfillment process. And any still existing examples where you see low hanging fruit to really improve fulfillment efficiency?
And then back to the point on investment. You didn't mention brick and mortar at all. There's been a lot of mention in the press about Amazon brick and mortar. I guess it would be curious to hear how you think about the importance of an Amazon brick and mortar presence and how that fits into the long-term strategy?
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure thing. So, particularly as it pertains to our fulfillment center networks, I think the biggest areas of efficiency right now are in our Amazon Robotics areas. That technology continues to improve, and we have – we're now multiple generations down. We just launched am Amazon Robotics fulfillment center in the Tokyo area recently, and I toured that last month, and it's just amazing to see the strides that Amazon Robotics has taken and the efficiency we're getting in our warehouse as a result.
The other efficiencies that we're seeing are network efficiencies, especially as we add things like sort centers. It's a collaboration and the movement between warehouses and sort centers and then to the end customer. The ability to have control through our sort centers has allowed us over the last few years to extend our cutoff times from 3:00 p.m. in most cases till midnight. So, greater control of our processes. If we do it cost effectively can also have favorable benefits both for our warehouse flow and also for our customers and their ordering pattern.
So, there's a lot of efficiencies that are going on day-to-day around here. One of the benefits of rapid growth is the ability to create leverage on purchases and a lot of the processes that we run.
So, your second question was on stores. Yes, I think you're seeing the expansion of our bookstores. We have six bookstores right now, and we have announced another six. The Amazon Go is in beta in Seattle, and while that's not large and only one site, we're excited about the potential there and the use of the technologies of computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning. We think that has a lot of potential. Again, it's only one location that's still in beta. But along with the bookstores, we also have – you'll see us in pop-up stores and college pickup points. So, for us it's another way to reach the customer and test what resonates with them, and we're pleased with the results.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Ronald V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC
Great. Thanks for taking the question. Brian, I think you mentioned the accelerating growth within AWS on new products and last year you added about 1,000. Can you just talk about maybe the plans for AWS and product growth going forward here in 2017 and the focus on innovation? Thanks
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. Yes, we haven't updated that number, but suffice to say the innovation pace continues to accelerate. We are very proud of the launches in Q4. The Amazon Connect, which we think will provide customer service capability to customers, and Amazon Chime, which we also believe will resonate with customers. We've had a lot of adoption of our new services. We've had – customers migrated more than 23,000 data basis using the AWS Database Migration Service since that launched last year. And just generally we continue to expand geographically.
We have announced additional availability zones and regions worldwide. So, again, signed a number of big customers. I guess I would point out in the quarter, Liberty Mutual, Snap and Live Nation all starting relationships with us or expanding their current relationship. We're now over a $14 billion run rate. We're happy with the business and the team, and again, for us innovation is going to be key as we move forward.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Brian, I had a couple questions about your growing advertising business. We see more and more of it appearing on the site. And I was interested to hear a little bit more about how you expect that business to roll out internationally. I think it's largely U.S. based today, but be curious to hear about that. And then second, I think it's fairly obvious why someone selling within the Amazon ecosystem would be interested in promoting on the platform, but maybe tell us a little bit about maybe over the long-term there are opportunities for sort of non-endemic advertisers within your platform. Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. Yeah, it's pretty early in the days with advertising, but we're very pleased with the team we have and the results. Our goal is to be helpful to consumers and enhance their shopping or their viewing experience with targeted recommendations, and we think a lot of the information we have and preferences of customers and recommendations help us do that for customers. We have a sponsored product, it's off to a great start, and it's a very effective way for advertisers to reach those especially interested customers.
While you're on the topic of advertising, I thought I'd point out that in other revenue, advertising is in other revenue, as is co-branded credit card agreements and also some other advertising services. That decelerated from 99% in Q4 to 58% in Q1. But the fluctuation and the volatility was essentially in the co-branded credit card agreements and the other services, which can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on contract terms. And that's what happened. Advertising remained strong and was consistent growth with Q4.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Thank you. So you periodically disclosed usage growth for AWS. But it has been some time since we saw one. So we're wondering if you can update us in terms of where you are now. If not, I mean, should we think about the growth in your cash deployment as an indicator of the ongoing growth? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Yes. Sorry, I don't have a usage number to share with you today. If it will help, I will tell you that, again, we're now over $14 billion run rate. You clearly see our – we break out very clearly our AWS segment revenue and operating income, and you'll also keep in mind that there's price decreases that are part of the business, and we're pretty public when we do those. And if you remember last call, I mentioned that we had seven price decreases that were timed for December 1. So, about a third of the impact of those was seen in Q4, and then again that's one element of the sequential operating margin. But in general, we're very happy with that team and the progress they're making. And we're deploying more capital as you can see to support the usage growth.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question. I just want to ask you about CapEx. It looks like CapEx including leases more than doubled year-over-year. So I know you listed kind of a long list of the many investment opportunities here, but can you just point out anything else in particular that drove the pretty substantial increase there? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. Yes, the CapEx, which is principally the fulfillment centers was – grew 51% year-over-year. As you'll remember, we added 26 warehouses last – fulfillment centers last year, 23 in the second half of the year. Some of that cost of start-up is before the start-up some comes in a quarter afterwards. So there was some carryover from that. But generally, the biggest trend here is that the differential between Amazon fulfilled network unit growth and paid unit growth.
So that nearly 40% growth in Amazon fulfilled units last year, and the continuation of the strong growth higher than the paid unit growth that we see in 2017 is resulting in a lot of fulfillment center capacity. And the fulfillment centers I'll also say with the robotics technology tend to be more capital intensive than prior versions of warehouses, and then they generally have much better operating efficiencies and variable costs following their start-up.
On the capital leases, that grew 45%. A good deal of that is tied to the AWS business. As I just mentioned, a lot of that is tied to usage growth. But a caution; CapEx can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, and if you look back to last year, the trailing 12 months was only 7% growth from the quarters through Q1 of last year. So certainly it was a bigger step-up in 2016 now carrying into 2017.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thanks. I know that we talked about over the last couple of quarters that part of the step-up in CapEx was to catch up from the under-investment in 2015. Just curious if you'd say – have you made a lot of progress in terms of catching up with some of the fulfillment needs that you saw necessary in the business at the beginning of last year? And then I know you just said that you're – it's still early days in terms of advertising, but there's a perception out there that over the last year or so that the company has sort of really begun to focus more on this business opportunity. Has something really changed at the business in the last year? And do you see advertising becoming a more meaningful part of the business over the near to midterm, I guess?
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. Let me start with advertising. So, yes, I think scale is helping. We've had great teams working on advertising for a while now. Our scale and number of customers, number of clicks, number of eyeballs, and new content – video content and other opportunities for advertising has really helped create some scale in that business. So we're very happy. I can't project it forward. But we're happy with the growth there. I think the sponsor products was a very inventive move for us, and I think that is having some really good impact on advertising growth.
On your second point about fulfillment capacity; here's how I'd generally generalize it. In Q4 of 2015, we were pretty vocal or pretty transparent anyway that we ran out of space in Q4, especially due to some very strong demand for FBA space and services. Last year we changed some of our incentives and worked with FBA merchants to try and have better throughput through our FCs, particularly in Q4. That combined with the step-up in fulfillment centers that I mentioned, the 26 new ones, left us in a really good position. We had a very clean holiday, and we think it worked well for both customers, Amazon and also for sellers – for FBA sellers.
So that leaves us now continuing to grow internationally as well because we continue to see strong FBA adoption, and it's a big part of our business, and it's a big part of our value with the additional Prime eligible ASNs that FBA provides. So, again, they're self-reinforcing, the FBA program and also our Prime program. The Prime program attracts more people to Amazon, and they buy more including FBA products and conversely more FBA products in our warehouses helps our in-stock of things that people want to buy, Prime eligible in-stock, and that helps reinforce the Prime program.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Thanks. I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of how we should think about the increase in unearned revenue. Obviously, this quarter biggest increase that you have seen from at least from a dollar perspective. What does that say about the way customers are changing in the behavior in the AWS business? How should we think about the way that that might be impacting pricing, mix, near-term growth?
Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.
Hi, Heath. This is Darin. Yeah, on a deferred revenue balances, as we've said in the past, the primary drivers of that increase are both the activity that we're seeing with our AWS customers and the purchase of Reserved Instances and prepaid credits for their account, as well as Prime member purchases. We're not breaking out the specific growth rates for Prime, but certainly it – we like what we see in terms of the growth, and it's been consistent with what we have seen over the last quarter or so. Certainly, the – part of that increase in deferred balances is related to Reserved Instances.
As customers get more comfortable and begin to put more sustained workloads into the AWS services through buying RIs, they're able to get fairly significant discounts on their usage. And so we like that model. Customers certainly like that model. And collecting that through deferred revenue and then letting customers use that over time is very helpful.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Thank you. A question on the transportation and logistics initiatives. And in particular, if you could share any of the effects or learnings thus far with air cargo. In particular, what kind of performance or cost-efficiencies that you may be realizing or expect to realize from this effort. Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure, Colin. As you point out, we're – we have expanded our own fleet. We now have 18 planes in service for Amazon, and we have announced rights to lease up to 40 planes. So it's gone very well. The ability to control shipments within our network has gone up, and we think the cost is very good. So on that front, it's better control, better capacity control, especially search capacity, and also good costs. So we have great relationships with third party carriers. We will continue to and we value all our partner relationships as we develop our own capability particularly in intra-network. We're putting it to good use, as I mentioned before, with the sortation center example.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Devitt with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
Scott Devitt - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Hi. Thanks. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about where you are in terms of an investment in capabilities in India at this point and how you think about that market longer term.
And then secondly, also if you could just comment on the limitations and your willingness to invest more throughout LatAm the way you have more recently in markets like China and India. And if I could, just finally, you've previously discussed satisfaction with the measurements of success for the video product in terms of consumer engagement, and the effects on Prime. I was just wondering if you could comment on whether these metrics are continuing to improve as spending continues to rise on video and consumer awareness is seemingly growing as well. Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Let me start with your middle question. I think it was about Latin America growth. Let me step back and talk about international growth in general. So our approach varies by country, and if you look, historically we've taken multiple approaches. So in China, we bought an existing business Joyo.com and built off that base. In India, we started from scratch and have built a lot of things ourselves. And it's always going to depend on the country that the dynamics in that country both for retail, for online, and for foreign investment. But a real key factor in all of this generally is management bandwidth as well.
So, we pick our spots carefully. You'll see – you heard in the quarter that we've announced the intention to buy Souq in the Middle East. Where does that fit into this strategy? Well, Souq's pioneered e-commerce in the Middle East, and they're creating great shipping experience for their customers and they're multiple countries, and they're doing a great job. So we see this as an example where we can learn from them, and also support their efforts with our Amazon technology and global resources.
So we're in Mexico, but we're not in other parts of Latin America. We have a business in Brazil. But other countries we'll take on a case-by-case basis, again, bounded by what our management bandwidth can support and prioritization versus other things. You obviously heard my long list of investments. All of those are pretty much gated by the need for people and software engineers and strong teams to approach them. So international expansion gets played off in the same prioritization that other efforts do.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer and Company. Please proceed with your questions.
Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Thanks. So is there just an accounting housekeeping a way to think about stock-based comp? You guys aren't providing that by segment anymore, but the rates of growth kind of differed by the businesses. And so is there just a way to think about, A, will that be in the queue? Or are you not disclosing it anymore? And is there a way to think about what I guess the patterns would be consistent with historical patterns by segment? Thanks.
Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.
Hi, Jason. This is Darin. Yes, we, a number of quarters back, started breaking out stock-based compensation by segment, and now we have collapsed that in our op income by segment. So it's definitely in there. We do provide some disclosure by P&L line item on a consolidated basis, that helps you identify that stock-based compensation expense in total and you'll see the trend and analysis and the metrics at the back of the press release.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question. Maybe I can take two away from the press release just to understand a little bit of the quarter-over-quarter cadence. On the retail subscription services, that saw a pretty big jump up in the growth rate year-on-year in Q1 versus Q4. I think that might be Prime memberships that come on to paid from trial. But just wanted to understand what maybe some of the driver was of that quarter-over-quarter in terms of the growth rate.
And net shipping costs actually grew at the slowest rate by our count in a couple of years. It looks like you're starting to get some improvements there in terms of revenue over costs on the shipping line. Just wanted to know what that was in terms of what is driving that and can we expect that to possibly continue. Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. Let me start with the retail subscription services revenue. So there's multiple things in that category. The largest is Prime membership fees, but also other subscription services like audio books, eBooks, digital video, digital music, and other subscription services. So you're right, there was an acceleration, much like the comment I had on advertising and the other revenue category. The Prime membership growth rates for Q1 and Q4 last year are relatively consistent. So the volatility is in these other items. So I'm not quantifying the Prime membership or commenting on the growth rates, other than to say it's been very strong and Q4 strength has continued into Q1.
Your comment on shipping costs, yeah, that is going to – it was lower unit volume as well, but generally, costs are going to be a combination of the tail – the headwinds are obviously going to be FBA growth and shipping more products ourselves and this expansion of our Prime program and the demand for products from our Prime customers. And the demand has been great. Again, there's over 50 million items that people can get delivered to their doorstep within two days or, in some cases, next day or same day. So it's going to be a big part of our cost structure but it's an investment we work hard to reduce as far as rates, and we're glad to spend it to support our Prime program.

Thank you. And our final question will come from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
Greg Melich - Evercore Group LLC
Hi. Thanks. I had a follow-up and then a new question. The follow-up is, would love an update. You talked a lot about the fulfillment centers, but could you update us on where we are in terms of rolling out Prime Now facilities and sorting centers? You're just accounting a few – you feel that scenario, it's a really ramped up investment this year or what you got last year is sort of what you need?
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. I'm sorry. You said Prime Now and what was the other thing?
Greg Melich - Evercore Group LLC
And the sorting centers.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sort centers. Sort centers, right. Well, I don't have updated numbers for you, but the Prime Now is available in more than 45 cities across eight countries. The Same-Day is available in 30 cities in the U.S. So, that's a bit on the quantification of those. I can't tell you much more on sort centers.
Greg Melich - Evercore Group LLC
But were you thinking about building out the capacity? It sounds like last year, you had that big surge in fulfillment centers. There isn't a similar surge about to happen this year on some of those other areas?
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Yes. I can't project that. We're still growing that and we're happy with the progress in Prime Now and the service that – the value that it creates for Prime customers. And as I said, we have expanded internationally, which was a big goal of ours as well. So we will continue to grow that. I can't quantify it for you right now. The other similar like facility metric you might want is that AmazonFresh is now in 21 metro areas in the U.S. as well as London and Tokyo.
Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.

Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2016 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.
For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor relations, Darin Manney. Please, go ahead.
Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.
Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2016 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2015.
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, February 2, 2017 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially.
Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
Our guidance also assumes among other things that we don't conclude additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
And just briefly before we move to questions, I'd like to address our Form 10-K that we'll be filing with the SEC. We received a comment letter from the SEC's Division of Corporate Finance regarding our 2015 Form 10-K and have subsequently been engaged with the SEC staff regarding our disclosures. We will be revising the disclosures of net, product and service sales in our Form 10-K. As a result, we expect to file our 2016 Form 10-K later than we typically have, but before the SEC's due date of March 1. These changes relate to our entity-wide disclosures and do not impact the financial results that we report for the company or our segments.
With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Our first question is coming from John Blackledge with Cowan. Please proceed with your question.
John Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks for the question. So, the first quarter GAAP operating income guide essentially implies negative incremental margins kind of at the low, mid and high end of guidance. So, just wondering if you could frame in order, if possible, the investment areas that are driving the negative incremental margins and then just generally how should we think about the margin profile in 2017? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. Thank you, John. First, let me talk about revenue just to get that out there as well. We are guiding to 17% to 25% growth on an FX-neutral basis. That includes approximately – excuse me, yes, on top of that is approximately 250 basis points or $730 million of FX negative impact which brings the non-FX adjusted rate down to – excuse me, range down to 14% to 23%. I will also point out that we have the leap year comp from last year. Last year, the extra day of leap year was worth 150 basis points to us in our Q1 revenue. This year, that reverses. So we have 150-basis point headwind to growth. And that's been factored into our guidance range.
But your question was on bottom line. So yes, what you are seeing, John, is the continuation of the step-up investment that we saw in the second half of last year. I talked about, in prior calls, about the fulfillment center step-up. We had 26 warehouses we added last year. 23 of them were in the second half of the year. Digital content, digital video content and marketing stepped up quite a bit in the second half of the year. We continue to invest heavily in those two areas. We also have investments in other Prime benefits from Prime Now to AmazonFresh and of course we are continuing to invest in Alexa and our Echo devices. And finally, I guess, I'd point out India which continues to be a rather large investment for us.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Devitt with Stifel.
Scott Devitt - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Hi. Thank you. Questions on video. I was wondering if you could just give any quantification in terms of the magnitude of video spend in 2017 as well as the lumpiness from an expensing standpoint quarterly.
And then separately as it relates to just the video service, from a positioning standpoint in the market, how do you think about the unique aspects of the product that Amazon has relative to others in the market in terms of the aggregation tools that are being provided now where some of the value is being perceived longer-term? Is it the uniqueness of the content or is it other things? If you could provide a little bit of color on that, that would be helpful. Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. Well, ultimately, I'll step back and say one of the main things we look out on Prime Video is customer usage patterns and in 2016 we had a doubling of Prime hours for video, music and reading. So we're happy with the engagement that customers have. We're also happy with the – especially on the Studios side, the people we've been able to work with, some of the most talented people in the entertainment industry. And our customers have responded really well to the shows that we've created. We've garnered awards, of course, but mainly that what we're focused on is good content that is attractive to customers.
I'll also point out that we rolled out the global Prime Video offer in the second half of last – or, excuse me, in Q4. And what we see there is again, original content is a fixed cost expense. The more we can amortize it over a large base, the better off we'll be. But more importantly, we have great content that we want to share with people outside of our primary retail countries. And this takes us to over 200 more countries. So we're very happy with the results in video. Yes, the investment did step up in the second half of last year, including marketing. And that will continue in 2017 and likely beyond.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from Ben Schachter with Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
Can you discuss what you're doing to help merchants in China sell and ship directly to consumers in the U.S. and other developed economies and how that business has been evolving over time? Thanks.
Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.
Yes, hi, Ben. This is Darin. Yes. We're very pleased with our FBA offering, and that's really helpful to sellers around the world. Certainly, our international sellers have access to more and more customers through that offering and that doesn't exclude sellers in China as well. The offering in China that we have for consumers is also a great, trusted customer engagement. And we have a very strong and trusted venue for Chinese customers to access international brands there as we continue to focus on great offerings through the AmazonGlobal Store, which offers great brands from outside of China to customers. And so there's a mix of things going on in China and we're happy with what we're seeing in both of those.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please state your question.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you. Just a follow-up on India and China. I know you are investing a lot. I'd love to hear how much, but you probably won't tell us. But can you tell us why you think the market is worth investment and what really attracts you to the market as you think out longer-term? And then China, can you give us any updates there on how financial performance is doing and if you've changed your strategy and if anything has gotten better there this year? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. Let me start with India. So, it's still very early. We continue to say that, but we are very encouraged with what we've created with customers and sellers alike in India over the last few years. We continue to develop new functionality for that country, whether it's delivery, whether it's seller features. We rolled out Prime last summer if you'll remember, and we recently launched Prime Video there. So we've had success with [technical difficulty] (10:55) we've been in. We don't expect India to be any different. We will continue to build our business there and continue to do a great job for both customers and sellers. We're bullish on India longer-term and it's early. But we like the initial engagement we're seeing and the response from, again, both customers and sellers.
Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.
Yes, and this is Darin. On China, like I said, we're very pleased with our offering in China. Our strategy there has been one of bringing a trusted and authentic product to customers in China, both domestically and from international offers. So we'll continue to focus on the Global Store there. As you may know, we've launched the Prime program that's focused around the availability of international goods in China and that we're pleased with what we're seeing there.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Two primary questions. Can you give us a sense of what the best way to think about the impact that the shift to third-party and within that, the growth in FBA is having on these sequential growth rates? To the extent that there's 150-basis point impact from leap year on a year-over-year basis, is there a way to quantify the impact that that shift to third-party is having on the growth rate for the first quarter for what you've reported in the fourth quarter?
And then on the AWS side of the business, with the price cut in November, can you give us some sense of what impact the price cut had on the deceleration in growth compared to the impact that presumably it had in driving incremental volume to the platform?
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. Let me start with that second question first. So more basically, on AWS, very happy with the response from customers. I feel we've got a very broad base of customers from startups to small-medium businesses to large enterprises to the public sector. And we're continuing to see strong growth across all those sectors. The business is now a $14 billion annualized – running at a $14 billion run rate. You are right that we had seven price cuts in Q4, essentially timed for December 1, so about 1/3 of the impact was seen in Q4.
But that's going to be constant in this business. We've been pretty clear that this business is all about creating new functionality for customers, giving price cuts and then working on the operating efficiencies. So, very pleased with Q4 and the pace of the business. The new services and features last year were over 1,000 versus 700 or so the – excuse me, in 2015. So we continue to innovate on behalf of customers. We're working with some very large customers in each industry. You've seen probably press releases on companies like Capital One, Workday, Salesforce and others. So, again, widespread usage and new customer adoption, which is great.
Your second question on FBA, I can't break out the year-over-year difference there. What I will say the impact of FBA on our business is and first that's one of the things that we look at is how well are we attracting new FBA sellers, because again, FBA reinforces Prime, Prime reinforces FBA. It's a good flywheel and we added active sellers in FBA grew 70% year-over-year in 2016. So we're very happy with the continued adoption of FBA and what that does to Prime, eligible selection for Prime members.
The other data point I'll give you that affects our cost structure is our Amazon Fulfilled units, which is the combination of retail plus FBA, grew nearly 40% last year and that compares to our paid unit growth of 24% in Q4. I'm giving you a Q4, not a full year number, but they're similar in relative proportion. The fulfillment center expenses and a lot of our shipping costs are tied to the increase in that FBA percentage and that growth of Amazon Fulfilled units.
So that is certainly a factor that we consider a positive from a customer standpoint and it's one from a cost standpoint that we certainly continue to work on every day. But that's about – I think that's the most I can give you on FBA at this point.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Thanks very much. Maybe as a quick follow-up on the quarter, we've heard from other e-commerce companies and retailers about a higher degree of promotional activity during Q4. So I wonder if there was any conscious decision on your part to pull back from some of the more aggressive discounting.
And then my whether question is whether you can shed any more light on the motivation to build out the air cargo hub in Cincinnati, understanding the need to support the growth of the core retail business, but also if this gives you more of an opportunity to build out direct connections to suppliers, for example, or a longer-term offer excess capacity or logistics as a service. Thank you very much.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure, Colin. On your first question, holidays are always a very promotional period. So we don't see – I can't really comment on the year-over-year differential in promotional activities to us. We are always looking to not be beat on price. We want to offer the best options to customers and we saw a lot of great response from customers this holiday season. I think we would be a very trusted holiday partner particularly as you get closer to the holiday. So, on the promotion side, we don't consider it a huge factor either way. It's pretty much a cost of doing business 12 months a year for us.
And, sorry, the second question is on the hub in Cincinnati – or excuse me, in Kentucky. Yes, that is – I saw the announcement on that. That is a partnership we have to build out the facility at the Hebron, Kentucky airport. I think it'll create thousands of jobs over time. What it does for us is it gives us a base for future growth. It's all about supplementing our existing capacity both our partners and ourselves and essentially building capacity that can handle this top line growth and also the growth in AFN or Amazon Fulfilled Network units which as I just mentioned is even higher than our paid unit growth.
So same as some of the investments you saw in airplanes last year, our partnerships with companies that do air cargo. This is about supplying our need for our customers and our sellers. We value the partnership with external, the external providers as well and I think we're all dealing with the problem of having lots of incremental volume year-over-year.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thank you. Just a question on paid unit growth. For the last several quarters here, it's been accelerating on a year-on-year basis and I think this quarter 24%, it was below the 26% that you reported in Q4 of 2015. Just kind of curious what had been driving the acceleration over the past few quarters and what may be changed this quarter?
And then in terms of the Q1 revenue guidance, wondering if you could provide a little bit of color in terms of the impact that maybe the recent AWS price adjustments are having on your Q1 guidance. Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Let me start with the second one. So we factored it in, obviously, into the numbers I gave through guidance, the timing of it was again closer to December 1. So there'll be an incremental differential in Q1 on those price cuts, but this is something that we again have quite frequently and I don't think it's a large factor in Q1. The bigger one is more mechanical that leap day comp I would say. And just if you're looking on a non-FX adjusted basis, the foreign exchange exposure, which I mentioned was $730 million or 250 basis points expected in this guidance.
Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.
Hi, Mark. This is Darin. On the unit growth, we're very happy with the 24% unit growth that we saw in Q4 like you mentioned. Our unit growth has been strong and that's primarily attributable to our Prime program and the customers and members that enjoy that program. As Brian mentioned, that 28% is only part of the story. Our Amazon Fulfilled units, the amount going through our fulfillment centers and which essentially includes our first-party retail and our FBA sales and it grew nearly 40% over 2016. So we're very pleased with those results and happy with the fundamentals of the business from that perspective.
Customers continue to respond very well to the low prices. The vast selection which is helped by the FBA sellers and the strong convenience that we can offer through FREE Two-Day Shipping and the multitude of other faster shipping options such as Same-Day, Next-Day and in some cases with Prime Now, the 1-Hour Delivery to 2-Hour Delivery. So Prime membership and selection continues to drive growth and you'll see that in our unit growth numbers.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to talk obviously about border tax. I was hoping that you could give us some of your initial thoughts there and how you might think about some of the key considerations around a potential border tax.
And then secondly, can you just talk a little bit about fulfillment centers. You mentioned the 26 fulfillment center buildout in 2016. Any color that you can give us in terms of how you're thinking about that for 2017? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. On the first one, we have a long-standing practice of not commenting on regulatory or tax matter. So I'm not going to comment on any proposed issues out there. We certainly keep an eye on external issues and weigh in when we think it's going to impact our business. But, your – sorry. Your second question was on FCs. We will continue to invest in FCs. The comparable I'll give you is that I won't forecast 2017, but the 20% growth in square footage that we saw in 2015 was followed by 30% square footage increase in 2016. That generally went to service that 40% growth in units, in AFN units. It also included some of the additional logistics delivery stations and all, too. So it's not all FC capacity, that's square footage. But I would say that we are going to continue to invest in fulfillment centers as long as our AFN growth rate maintains high, and we certainly want to keep that high and growing.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks. Two questions, please. First, any comment on customer growth qualitatively, how that's trended, how that trended throughout the year, accelerated, consistent, decelerated? And then, would you be willing to give any commentary on the engagement impact you're seeing from all of these Echo devices that are getting into households? Are you seeing people shop more? Are they engaging more with other parts of Amazon? Just any sort of impact on what people with these Echo devices do that's different than Amazon customers that don't have them. Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. Let me start with the Echo. So I don't think I'm going to answer your exact question there on quantifying the retail sales through Echo devices. It's still very early days on that, so that's not material. But the engagement is just like any other Prime benefit or investment that we have. We do look at engagement and we like the engagement of customers who have Echoes. But let me step back a minute and give some highlights on that, Alexa and Echo together. As we mentioned in our press release, the unit sales of Echoes grew nine times, 9x, year-over-year during the holiday period. So, great customer adoption. We're really glad to see that and that creates a great base of Echo and Alexa fans out there.
We've added 4,000 skills to Alexa since I last spoke to you in October and we're working with a lot of major companies as they add abilities, too, for our customer base to use the Alexa or the Echo to reach them. Tens of thousands of developers are building new skills for Alexa. So, the skills addition should continue. And just as importantly, tens of thousands of developers are also using the Alexa Voice Service to help integrate Alexa into their products, which then creates a great network effect. We're doing that ourselves. If you've seen in the quarter, we added Alexa capabilities to our tablets and Fire TV devices, making them better. So it's a great, again, part of the flywheel in that, Echo and Alexa make the devices better and it builds engagement, not only with Echo and Alexa, but also with Amazon.
Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.
Hi, Mark. This is Darin. On the customer count, no absolute number to give this quarter. As you know, back in Q1 we gave an active customer count that exceeded 300 million and I can say it's still growing and we're pleased with the number there. What we do like is the engagement with Prime. We continue to add Prime members and similar to the flywheel that Brian was just mentioning, that the FBA selection helps us with engaging customers and in particular the Prime program. So we're very pleased with our customer engagement this year.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one is just on the last mile, the logistics build. Can you help us at all on what you're seeing in some of these markets like the UK where you have more of the last mile buildout done on your own? Is there anything you're seeing about Prime behavior? What are the advantages and even the challenges you're facing as you're building out the last mile?
And then secondly, on the brick-and-mortar stores, any learnings, and strategically, just talk to the strategic advantage of having a bigger Amazon storefront. Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. Let me start with your first question. So as you point out, we've had Amazon Logistics deliveries in the UK for more years than some of our other countries and what we see is it gives us control of the shipment for a lot longer. We can, again, shift order cutoff times out and time is valuable to us because, again, we can avoid split shipments, we can avoid other costs of acceleration. And so having control later in the process is very valuable to us especially as we're working across multiple nodes in a network.
But I've driven with drivers in Downtown London and it's a very interesting experience. I think it's a great value to our customers. It's interesting to see the route density that we see in the high cities – or, excuse me, in some cities and the challenges and the upside of that. But I would say essentially, in a nutshell, our logistics deliveries allow us to have better control of the end delivery in markets where we use it. The challenge is always going to be cost and as we get better at this and get economies of scale, we lower those costs over time. So that's essentially my overview of Amazon Logistics.
Sorry, your second question was on – oh, the stores, sorry. Yes, you probably noticed we launched the – we opened the Amazon Go Store in Seattle in the fourth quarter. We think that is very interesting. It's only one store at this time. But it's using some of the same technologies you would see in self-driving cars; computer vision, sensor, fusion, deep learning. So it's a great accomplishment by that team. It's in beta right now and we like the promise of that.
Probably more advanced and further along are the Amazon Bookstores. We have three physical stores; Seattle, San Diego, and Portland right now. We see adding five more this year. So we're still in that phase where we're testing and learning and getting better, even on the bookstore. I would say there's other things that are physical in nature, the pop-up stores and college pickup points that we learn from as well, and think creates a great value particularly at the college pickup points.
So not much projection beyond where we are today except for the fact that we will be adding more bookstores. But we test, we innovate, we think the bookstores for instance are a really great way for customers to engage with our devices and see them, touch them, play with them and become fans. So we see a lot of value in that as well.

Our next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.
Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Thanks. Two questions. As we think about investment in the first quarter in 2017, any color how to think about domestic versus international. You did give some comments about India, but just any other color or how to think about it?
And then on AWS, you announced both new products that reinvent at the low end and at the high end. Any commentary on if that impacted the types of customers who you've been adding on AWS with those new products. Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. I can't give an exact split of the investments by geography, but I would say most of the fulfillment expansion was in North America last year. Most of those 26 warehouses we talked about. We see that being more balanced over time and being more global as we move forward. Video content is with the new global program, global Prime Video is becoming more global with the launch in India as well. And, of course, we had Prime Video in some of our existing countries prior to that. So that is going more global and will be more balanced. As we see devices roll out to other countries, same thing.
So I would say over time it will become more balanced and probably what you've seen in the short run tended to be more North America focused. But I can't give you a great split of – I'm not giving you the absolutes anyway, so I can't give you a great split of the two. And I will also say that we are – not all of our investments are on the consumer side. AWS continues to expand their global footprint. Last year, we added regions in the UK and Canada. We now have 42 availability zones in 16 geographic regions and we will continue to grow that business globally. And India, again, we've mentioned, but that is, obviously, an international investment.
Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.
On the customer split, we serve – in AWS, we serve millions of active customers along the spectrum of large enterprise companies as well as small startups and the public company – or public environment as well. The multitude of launches that we had in reinvent was great for all sizes of customers, really, both large and small; both companies starting – just getting their start with AWS, but also companies that have been engaged with AWS for many years.
And so we're really happy about the engagement of reinvent and the participation in that conference as well as the engagement of the new services that we've launched in Q4 and all of 2016, really.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two, if I can ask. One, the other North America revenue line in our view has a lot of advertising revenue in it and that line continues to sort of show a lot of momentum, come in better than expected. Can you talk holistically sort of short-term, medium-term, long-term about how you think you're approaching an advertising business across your broad properties, what that might become longer-term and how that might impact the P&L?
And then one housekeeping item, anything to call out as an impact from demonetization efforts in India in either Q4 or Q1? Thanks so much.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Yes, sure. I'll take the advertising question. So yes, it's very early in the advertising space. But what our goals there are to be helpful to customers and enhance their shopping and viewing experiences, mostly with targeted recommendations. We think that is a good strategy rather than invasive things that take away from the shopping experience. I would say Sponsored Products is off to a great start. I find it a very effective way for advertisers to reach interested customers. We also, on video, have not added much in the way of advertising yet. There's some pre-roll as we call it. But for the most part, we like the progression. We are balancing customer experience with advertising at all times and we like the team that's working on it.
Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.
And on other revenue, I just want to call out, there's a number of things going into that particular line. These things include revenue from our co-branded credit card arrangements and certain advertising, particularly display advertising. We have other types of advertising that's spread out throughout the P&L, whether that's a kind of shared marketing investment from our vendors which goes into contra COGS and lowers the cost of sales, or it's related to other seller advertising which is generally within the EGM and media categories. And so I'd say other revenue incorporates a number of things, not just advertising. And on India demonetization, nothing particular to call out today on that.

Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Nomura Instinet. Please proceed with your question.
Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
Thanks for taking my questions. It's about Prime Video. You said you were pleased with the hours of engagement. My question is do you think that the hours of video stream need to accelerate from here to get to an adequate return on the invested capital in video? Or are you happy with those returns with the current levels of engagement?
And then relatively on Prime Video, could you just talk about your ambitions to potentially extend the video offering beyond on-demand and into possibly a virtual cable bundle? And then finally, just a question of do you need to aggressively partner with distributors, whether they be cable distributors or hardware device companies in order to get better distribution of the Amazon Prime Instant Video app and content to your customers? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Yes, I can't add too much or won't add too much on the last two questions. But I will say on – you're talking about the levels of engagement now that we're seeing versus what would be the long-term model over time. We're certainly spending ahead of the value of the engagement right now, but it's a good sign that it's building. And an important step was that global Prime program that we launched in the fall – excuse me, in Q4. As I said, it's very much a fixed expense game, especially with original content. That fixed amount can go up or down, but the ability to amortize it over a large population is what we're looking for.
So, we see a double benefit of the global Prime Video program, again both to amortize the investment in original content but also to show that original content to more and more people, because we think it's done really well. We think it's won a lot of awards and we've worked with some – again some great, talented people. And it's our ability to scale that and to amortize it over a much larger customer base, which will help us in the future.
Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.

Good day everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com Q3 2016 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Darin Manney. Please go ahead.
Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.
Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2016 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you which includes our financial results as well as metric and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2015.
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's view as of today, October 27, 2016, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which are posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal segments. It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.
Question-and-Answer Session

At this time, we will now open up the call for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please state your question.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question. The International retail segment margin was the lowest we've seen in quite a while. I was hoping you could provide some of the key drivers there in terms of the drag and any color on how to think about the incremental international investment that might be impacting the 4Q guide. Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. Thanks, Doug. Yes, specifically to International, we are seeing expansion to support selection, expansion at fulfillment network increases. We're also investing in digital content and additional Prime benefits, fresh location Prime Now. But by far the biggest individual thing is the investment in India that we continue to make and very excited about it, the initial reaction in India from both the customers and also sellers. So that is essentially the International margin guidance in Q4.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.
Eugene Charles Munster - Piper Jaffray & Co.
Great. Thanks. I guess when we think about the progression of margins in the second half versus the second half of 2015 and kind of the flat-lining of overall margin at this point excluding AWS, I guess should we think about this as being a temporary kind of plateau that will at some point resume once you start leveraging the fulfillment build-out? Or is there something structurally or philosophically changing with the way that you operate your business? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Yes. Thanks, Gene. Well we will continue to invest in the business where we are seeing significant customer traction. And the things I'm about to mention fall into that category. But the largest individual reasons for the ramp-up in investment between first half and second half of this year and also second half of this year versus second half of last year are the things I mentioned on the call last quarter.
First, video content and marketing associated with that is nearly doubling year-over-year in the second half of the year. And it continues to be a large increase both Q3 and Q4. In the quarter, in Q3 we added 18 fulfillment centers and we've added five more in October. For the year we'll add 26. Most of those are in North America but that compares to 14 last year and I would look, looking back the last time we had double-digit increase in fulfillment centers was in 2012 when we added 11 in the third quarter.
So it was a rare aggregation of startups in Q3 and into Q4 that's helping us position better for Q4 volumes. Because paid unit growth continues to be strong and Amazon fulfilled unit growth which includes what we ship, includes FBA, is significantly higher than even that. So we continue to build for high AFN, or Amazon Fulfilled Network demand, including both retail and FBA. The number of warehouses that we added represents a 30% increase in square footage year-over-year. Last year we increased square footage by just under 20%. The definition of square footage in this case is all of our warehouses plus our sortation and delivery centers. So it's pretty much our customer service centers. So it's pretty much our full square footage that supports operation.
So those will dissipate as as they burn in. We've talked about fulfillment centers' initial startup costs include increase in fixed costs but also variable cost as we train workers and also bring in inventory. And there's a number of transportation costs also related to the startup of a new fulfillment center, both inbound and outbound. And they're inherently less efficient than more established mature buildings, so there will be a cycle where those will be more productive next year than they are this year and more productive in 2018 than they are in 2017.
So what you're seeing essentially in the second half of this year is a step-up investment primarily around digital content and also the fulfillment center investment, but also things like Echo and Alexa which we're adding a lot of resources to, India and AWS as we add people there to support additional service, think (7:54) rapid growth in that business.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my question and I have two. The first one, just to go back, Brian, to the fulfillment build. In the past, I think you've talked about how it takes time to kind of get the fulfillment centers to peak efficiencies, so with these new FCs opening, could you just talk about it? Have you become more efficient so if you get into a lower volume quarter next year, there's less risk of deleverage? Or should we still kind of think about it's going to take time to get to up to peak efficiency?
And then the second one, AWS. Amazon is a company that is very good at removing friction in the purchase process. Could you just talk about some of the main hurdles you still have to overcome for large enterprises to really start using AWS more? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. So the fulfillment network as we built it, yes, they'll be more productive next year than they are this holiday peak and probably even more productive in 2018. So I can't forecast it for you into next year quite yet, but we certainly had productivity add additional cost to Q3 and even into Q4 of this year as we build the additional capacity. Again, the underlying reason for that capacity build is the strength in paid units and even more so in the units that we're fulfilling driven by our FBA program. The FBA program is a key pillar of our Prime offering. It adds selection. It makes Prime stronger and then that's a self-reinforcing where Prime then – the Prime success attract mores sellers. So we're glad to have that problem. We are just working very hard to get capacity in place and in productive use for Q4 and beyond.
Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.
Hi Brian. This is Darin. On the AWS question, yeah, we continue to invest in AWS on behalf of our customers in addition to the technologies that make integrations easier that helps companies move from an on-prem or a hybrid IT environment into AWS. So we're going to continue to do that, specifically things like the database migration tool that are helpful for customers when they move production databases from on premises to the cloud with virtually no downtime.
And also many of our AWS customers are beginning to choose and continue to choose the AWS Schema Conversion Tool which really switches database engines to get out of old guard proprietary databases and onto AWS. And so we'll continue to react to customer needs and that will include opening up new regions. We've opened up Ohio this past quarter and we've highlighted that we'll have another number of regions coming online in a few months. So yeah, were doing a lot of things to help make it easier for all customers to migrate to AWS.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Hey, Brian. Would you give us any commentary on two categories, in particular groceries and fashion and apparel? And particularly on groceries, I know in the release there's a couple of data points about Fresh rolling out into newer areas like Maryland, great to see that. But could you just talk about that in the investment horizon? Is that moving the needle for you? And how big that, any way to help us quantify how big that already is to the revenue growth that you're seeing, particularly on groceries and any particular comments on fashion and apparel, same line of thinking? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Okay. Sure. Thanks, Mark. I will start with Fresh and groceries in general. So yes, this quarter we launched in Northern Virginia, Maryland, Dallas and Chicago. We also launched a new pricing plan which is a monthly $14.99 add-on to Prime in the U.S. and we've expanded, as you know, previously into London. We're very happy with the progression, both in the geographies that we've been in for a long time where we're at, continuing to add zip codes and additional neighborhoods and also in these new cities. Certainly a business where we continue to work on costs and profitability, but we are finding it's a very attractive service to our customers, which is what we're after.
Similarly, but not exactly the same is the Prime Now business, which has similar overlap on things besides groceries. It's a slightly different model obviously where we're more about immediacy and a smaller list of items available in one to two hours. But there's certainly a lot of people who are using that for groceries and consumable items. And that is now up to 40 cities across seven countries versus 17 this time last year. We're also adding restaurant, Amazon Restaurant Delivery to the Prime Now offer in 19 metropolitan cities in the U.S. and that's up from two last year.
So we continue to believe consumables, groceries are a key part of the offer to customers and we are playing with very different models to see which works and for what needs. So we're very happy with the AmazonFresh and we've now expanded quite a bit as you see in this year. And Prime Now, we're also very happy with, although obviously the economics in that business are even tougher, but we do feel that our scale makes that possible because of the geographic footprint and how close we already are to customers.
Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.
Hi, Mark. This is Darin. On fashion, yeah, fashion and apparel continue to be a large part of our EGM business and one that we're very excited about. We continue to make it easier for brands and manufacturers to come on board in that category. We continue to work with brands to come on board and we're happy with the traction we're seeing with those brands. And as we get more and more selection, we're really pleased with the customer engagement that we have there, both from the discoverability, the technology that goes behind making it easier to shop for fashion on our site as well as the increased selection by adding the brands.
Operator
Thank -
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sorry. To answer your question about was that part of investment. Yes, this is certainly part of our investment but the large ramp, if you will, in investment that we're seeing from the back end of last year and also the first half of this year is more related to digital content and the build in our fulfillment network, which I've already discussed.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Thanks a lot. In some of these incremental investment areas like warehouses, logistics and also content, I know in some cases you expense up front. In some cases you amortize over time. Just wondering if you could give us a sense of how much of the recent step-up is kind of being expensed. I'm particularly looking at your COGS as a percent of retail revenues which was up year-on-year for the first time in quite a while. How much of that was because of content that was expensed in the period? Just trying to kind of better understand that.
And I think also you've been changing around, and this is happening here shortly, FBA pricing including increasing your storage fees but also reducing your handling fees. I guess the question is, are these changes designed to just pass through kind of increasing shipping costs? Or is this more of a net-neutral change where really the goal is to try to free up capacity in some of your facilities? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Let me start with your second question on FBA. So yes, we did make some changes to the pricing formula for this holiday season. They're essentially meant to incent the right behavior among sellers around holiday. And the biggest issue you're trying to get at is having the most valuable products for holiday in the warehouse in the Prime space and not having the warehouse filled with things that may not sell until after the New Year. So we are trying to incentivize that behavior. We're also trying to incentivize getting inventory into the warehouse quicker. So yes, the formulas were, or excuse me, the changing to the pricing formulas were really with that in mind to help the flow and the base utilization in Q4.
Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.
Yeah, hi Mark. This is Darin. On the capitalization point, I'd say the things we capitalized are the core buildings and leasehold improvements in the buildings. But the things that we're seeing hit the P&L are the fixed and variable expenses that it takes to run the building and I think that's what Brian's pointing out most pointedly in terms of what is impacting the profitability of the second half. So yeah, the capitalization's relatively small in terms of, other than in the building itself.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question.
Youssef Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities
Yes. Thank you very much. Two quick questions. With the step-up in investments in content from Prime Video that you mentioned before, would you also be stepping up the international expansion? Maybe you can just remind us how many countries you're in with Prime Video and whether there is a potential chance of maybe stripping Prime Video from Prime to allow it to be extended to other countries.
And then I know you're not guiding to 2017. But just looking at the capacity increases that you've had for FCs for 2016, should we expect kind of that as an ongoing expense going forward? Or is the current buildup enough to maybe give you some spare capacity to cool that down for 2017? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. So first on your video comment. We're in four countries right now, the U.S., UK, Germany and Japan. And we have stated that we will be in India soon. So the content that we are creating, especially through Amazon Studios, we are generally holding the worldwide rights to and can use that in other countries as well. And the cost of that then gets amortized to those countries. It becomes part of the International segment results. So yes, and we consider that to be very valuable as opposed to, versus licensing many times by country, the third-party rights to content that we don't create ourselves.
Your question on fulfillment expenses, I can't extend the guidance into next year. We will do that obviously at the end of next quarter. But I would say this was an extraordinary step up, as I mentioned, in Q3 that is tied to very rapid growth in not only paid units but Amazon fulfilled units. So really, our forecast for additional capacity additions and the rate of additions will be tied to those growth factors as well. So we'll have to see. We right now are working on getting the capacity in. It was very lumpy this time with 18 warehouses in one quarter and another five in the first three weeks of the next quarter. So ,and obviously we'll be working on the efficiencies of all the warehouses we have, including the ones we just started up this year.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird Equity Research. Please proceed with your question.
Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Great. Thanks. A follow-up on the FC question, and I guess more specifically it sounds like you have enough capacity in terms of fulfillment centers for the holidays, but also wondering what your comfort level is in terms of your shipping partners to manage those deliveries. And then secondly, was wondering how you would characterize the pricing environment for AWS, in particular with more deep-pocketed competitors in the space now. Google in fact highlighted this on their conference call today. Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. Let me start with transportation. So yeah, we looking forward to a great holiday and that includes working with our shipping partners both in the U.S. and globally. We've worked very closely with them to line up capacity, share capacity plans. We certainly have additional delivery capability of our own. But with all of our partners, we work well in advance of the holiday to get our plans in place. And we feel very confident. We're looking forward to a great holiday not only for customers but also for sellers.
On your question on AWS, I didn't listen to the Google call, but you'll have to fill me in on that later. The thing I can tell you about pricing is that our pricing is, price reductions are a core part of our philosophy, of course. We had a price decrease in Q3, and that was our 52nd since we started this business. So we are comfortable with price decreases. Not only did we lower the prices of our products but we also create new services that are cheaper that customers can switch to. So they can also benefit from that as well.
So if you step back and say why do people choose AWS, I'll give you the points I said last quarter. Basically what we hear are the functionality and pace of innovation is greater than our competition. We have added more new significant features and services this year already than we had all of last year when we added 722. We have a partner and customer ecosystem. You've read about the VMware deal that we signed this quarter. So we continue to extend with partners and build ecosystems that better can support customers. And finally experience. We've been in this business a long time, longer than anyone else, and we've used that time to make our products and services better. So there was going to be a lot of winners in this space as we said, but we are very happy with our position and the customer reception to our products.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Great. Thank you. I guess when you look at fourth quarter guidance and you back out AWS, it suggests that margins are, on the core business, are going to be pretty down versus last year. Do you view this as a abnormal investment cycle, or just part of the overall kind of ebbs and flows of the business? And then long-term, I know several years ago you talked about maybe high single digit, low double digit margins long term. I wonder if you could refresh us on that, and also just let us know if you think International has structural margin differences than the U.S. in the core retail business. Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. Yes. As far as the continuation of the investment into next year, I cannot give you much color on that today. What I can tell you again is that we've ramped up considerably. We've been investing quite openly in a lot of areas and continue to do so. We are experiencing a ramp-up, if you will, in the second half of this year particularly tied again to AWS, or excuse me, the fulfillment center spend and also the video content spend.
So we will continue to invest in video content. We'll continue to invest in fulfillment space to handle higher and higher paid unit volumes and shipped unit volumes. We'll continue to invest in things that we believe enhance the customer experience, particularly the Prime experience. Devices, we'll continue to invest in as particularly Alexa and the Echo products. We'll continue to invest in getting faster and faster shipping methods for our consumers. We believe that's working. We're very happy with the results. We're very happy with all the customers we have but particularly the Prime customers that we have.
As far as long-term operating margins, I can't forecast that right now. I can't forecast that for our AWS business either. We are again working on two fronts. We are honing the businesses that we're in and making them as efficient, as profitable as possible while also investing very pointedly and very wisely, we believe, in things that will enhance customer experience and create lasting businesses for us down the line. We've said we want things that customers will love, can grow to be large, will have strong financial returns and durable and can last for decades. So that's still our mission. We have pillars of the business right now with Marketplace, AWS and Prime and we're actively looking for a fourth and fifth pillar.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. I was just wondering, there have obviously been some headlines since the call that you did earlier with the press on the scale of this investment cycle relative to other investment cycles that you've been through. With the 2014 cycle sort of being the most recent, could you quantify a little bit more how you would compare this investment cycle to that most recent one? And to the extent that we are in the midst of this investment cycle, would you say we're in sort of the earlier or later stages? Any sort of clarity around that would be useful. Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. Yes. The word cycle, if I mentioned that, was a omission. It was a mis-speak. The investment that we are seeing is a step-up versus what we have experienced in particularly the first half of this year and the last half, the second half of last year which I mentioned. But we have said investments are going to be lumpy. They are going to be high sometimes and they'll be moderated at other times. We are right now, the second half of this year looks like a big step-up compared to the first half and it is. But again, it's all areas that we will continue to invest in, some of which I just actually went through the laundry list. So I would not characterize it as a cycle. I would characterize it as continued investments. We make investments with the idea that they are going to pay off and they pay off in either directly in the business they're in or in their contribution to the total business many times as a part of the Prime program.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.
John Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks, just two questions. It seems you're increasing your efforts in the auto vertical with the recent launch of Amazon Vehicles. Just wondering if you could discuss some of the dynamics of the auto industry that make it attractive and maybe how it aligns with the Prime value prop. And also wondering if you had any plans to work directly with auto shops just given your ability to service most areas in one to two days. And then just the second question, on grocery would you consider physical locations in an effort to kind of expand and/or accelerate the growth in that vertical? Thank you.
Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.
Yeah, hi John. This is Darin. On vehicles, Amazon Vehicles is really a car research destination and really builds the automotive community for customers and gets information they need when shopping for vehicles offsite or shopping for parts and accessories onsite. The features include research tools, community engagement where you can talk to other customers, and certainly we'll try to build a one-stop shop for vehicles as an extension to the automotive store which engages customers to add information about their cars in their garage and which makes it actually easier to shop for parts and accessories for your particular vehicle. And so we think there's a lot of opportunity there to add convenience for customers. On the B2B side, certainly we do have a Amazon business offering. Businesses of all shapes and sizes can sign up to be a B2B customer and the selection that we have in our parts and in automotive categories are certainly open to that channel, but I wouldn't speculate on anything we might do in a particular vertical for those business customers.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Sure. And your comment on, or question on grocery and physical stores, I can't comment on any rumors or speculations there might be regarding that. But what I will tell you is we have experimented with physical stores. As you may know, we have three physical bookstores, one Seattle, one in San Diego and one in Portland and two more coming, one in Boston and one in Chicago. And what we're finding is they're great places for customers to browse what ends up being a curated selection of books and they also get to try out our devices, which is very beneficial. So they get to touch and try our eReaders, tablets, Fire TV and Echo. So we like what we see with that connection and we also have pop-up stores that you may see and also college pick-up points. So we will try different delivery methods or pick-up points or ways of getting product to customers, but nothing specific to point out on the grocery side right now.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Schachter with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.
Ben Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
Given the low unemployment rates that you're seeing in the U.S., do you expect any unusual impact on wages for seasonal workers this year? And are you seeing overall wage pressure in the fulfillment centers? And then separately, if you could just talk about trend lines you're seeing in paid units versus shipping units. Are they diverging meaningfully versus the past? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Yeah, so on wages, nothing to point out for this holiday. Our challenge generally is the volume of head count that we're looking to hire and we work well in advance with agencies to help to get seasonal employees and many of them turn into full-time employees after the holiday. So nothing specific on the wage pressure front. As you probably saw, head count is up 38% year-over-year in Q3 and that is a continuation of a lot of ops roles they're supporting this high demand, the opening of the fulfillment centers we talked about, new Fresh locations, Prime Now. But also a lot of hiring in our tech areas particularly around AWS and also the Echo, Alexa areas.
Ben Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
And the second, the second question?
Operator
Sorry. Go ahead. Okay. And our final question will come from the line of Neil Doshi with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.
Neil A. Doshi - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.
Great. Thanks. Can you just provide a little more color into the investments that you're making in India? What's driving that growth and what stage is India in today relative to some of the other large international markets that you've launched in the past?
Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.
Yeah, sure. So we are very encouraged by what we're seeing in India but it is certainly very early on still. Most recent highlights would be the launch of the Prime program in India this past quarter. It's now one of the top selling units based on Amazon.in. And so it's very been very well received by customers. It's hard to compare India to any other country. It's very different in its stage and structure. Being a third-party market has caused a lot of invention on our side. We're being creative. The team there in India has been very creative on whenever they find a roadblock or something that has not existed in another country, they create it themselves, whether that's from delivery stations to working with small merchants to, you name it. So we're very happy with both the customer engagement that we're seeing and also the seller engagement which is very important in India and very pleased with the team that runs it over there and the way they work with teams throughout the world.
Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.
And Brian, to step back to Ben's other question on units. Ben, this is Darin. I will, so you know, paid units grew at 28% again this year as it did in the prior quarter. And as Brian pointed out earlier, our AFN unit, our Amazon fulfilled units, which include our first-party units as well as FBA units that go through our warehouses are continuing, are certainly higher than that 28%. And that's a result of the traction we're getting with our FBA sellers.
Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.
So thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.",https://seekingalpha.com/article/4016101-amazon-com-amzn-q3-2016-results-earnings-call-transcript

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q2 2016 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.
For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Darin Manney. Please go ahead.
Darin Manney - Director, Head of Investor Relations, Amazon
Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2016 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. We'll be available for questions after our prepared remarks.
The following discussion and the responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 28, 2016 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2015.
Now I'll turn the call over to Brian.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Darin. I'll begin with comments on our second quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 42% to $12.7 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $7.3 billion, up from $4.4 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less lease principal repayments increased to $3.9 billion, up from $2.4 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases increased to $2.5 billion, up from an outflow of $492 million. Worldwide revenue increased 31% to $30.4 billion or 30%, excluding the $166 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 28%. Worldwide seller units represented 49% of paid units.
Now I'll talk about our segment results. North America revenue grew 28% to $17.7 billion. North America operating income was $702 million, a 4% operating margin compared with $348 million in the prior year. This includes $5 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. International revenue grew 30% to $9.8 billion. Excluding the $184 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 28%.
International operating loss was $135 million compared with the loss of $189 million in the prior year. This includes $40 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.
Amazon Web Services' revenue grew 58% to $2.9 billion. Amazon Web Services' operating income was $718 million, a 24.9% operating margin compared with $305 million in the prior year.
Our operating income was $1.3 billion or 4.2% of revenue, up approximately 220 basis points year-over-year. This includes $45 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Net income was $857 million or $1.78 per diluted share compared with a net income of $92 million or $0.19 per diluted share.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. For Q3 2016, we expect net sales of between $31 billion and $33.5 billion or growth of between 22% and 32%. This guidance anticipates approximately 30 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates.
Operating income to be between $50 million and $650 million compared with $406 million in third quarter 2015. We're grateful to our customers and remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks.
And with that, I'll hand it back to Darin.
Darin Manney - Director, Head of Investor Relations, Amazon
Thank you, Brian. Before we move to questions, I need to remind you that our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe to be appropriate assumption. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
Our guidance also assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently. It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services and, therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
With that, let's move to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. [Operation Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from Mark May of Citi. Please proceed.
Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Thanks for taking my question. We've noticed some data points out there that suggest that you're kind of accelerating your build-out of fulfillment capacity in North America and obviously also in India. Can you give us a sense of what sort of impact that, that might have in the near to mid-term on your CapEx, depreciation and ultimately CSOI, especially as it relates to your Q3 guidance? And then just kind of a maintenance question, how much is FX impacting your Q3 guidance? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Okay. Thanks, Mark. Yeah, let me talk a little bit about guidance and I'll incorporate the answer to the fulfillment question. So, you'll notice on the top line guidance of $31 billion to $33.5 billion or 22% to 32% growth incorporates the Prime Day results and I can talk more about that later. But Prime Day was very successful for us. It was up 60% on a worldwide basis over the prior year, and it was also a record day for our Amazon devices, as well as sellers and customers alike.
In the bottom line, you'll need to remember that Q3 is a typically a lower operating income quarter as we prepare for Q4, the holiday peak. It's a little bit more exaggerated this year in that we're opening 18 fulfillment centers this quarter. To put that in perspective, we launched six in Q3 of last year. This will bring us up to 21 net FCs for the year by the end of Q3 and that compares with 10 fulfillment centers for the first three quarters of last year on a net basis. So, why are we expanding so much? If you remember back to Q4 and the capacity constraints we had in Q4, primarily due to really strong FBA growth, we talked a lot in the Q4 call about the operational cost of that in Q4. Customers well taken care of, but we had additional fulfillment costs from being so tight on capacity.
This year, with that in mind and then knowing that our growth rate is actually accelerating on a unit basis, we are – Q2 was 28% unit growth for paid units, but fulfilled by – units Fulfilled by Amazon is much higher than that due to the growth of Prime and FBA. That compares with last year in Q2 when we saw 22% unit growth, so we're 600 basis points faster growth in Q2 this year than last year and that 22% last year turned into 26% in Q4. So it ramped up in the back end of the year.
So a lot of data points there, but the bottom line is that there's a large step up in the amount of fulfillment capacity in Q2 – excuse me, Q3 versus Q2. There's a couple of other factors while I'm at it for guidance. We are also nearly doubling our content spend in the second half of this year versus the second half of 2015. We have a great slate of new Amazon Originals coming out later this year, both in the U.S. and internationally. And we're nearly tripling our number of new Amazon Original shows – TV shows and movies compared with the second half of last year.
There are other investments certainly that are increasing sequentially. I'd point to India and AWS, but primarily the two biggest issues in Q3 guidance I would say are the operational ramp and also the increase in digital content spend.
Darin Manney - Director, Head of Investor Relations, Amazon
And, Mark, to follow up on the other question, our net sales guidance anticipates approximately 30 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates.
Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
And, Brian, where does that bring your video content spend to with the doubling in the second half if we look at it on an annualized basis?
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
We're not disclosing that at this time.
Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Thanks.

Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan. Please state your question.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the questions. I just want to go back to Prime Day for a minute. I didn't hear any commentary around new Prime members in particular. Obviously a lot of other metrics that you gave but hoping you could provide a little bit more color around that. And then also, is there anything else that kind of stood out in terms of what you learned around operations and systems ahead of the holiday season? And then just going back to the 3Q guide, what's the right way for us to think about stock-based comp in the third quarter? And if we looked at your 2Q numbers, is that kind of a fair assumption for what you're thinking about? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure. Let me circle back on Prime Day. So again, it was the biggest global day ever for Amazon and was up 60% on a order product sales basis versus Prime Day 2015. It was a record day for Amazon devices. It was a great day for small businesses and sellers who saw great year-over improvement in their sales. And more importantly, it was a great day for customers. Globally they saved over double what they had saved in Prime Day 2015. So we're very pleased with the results of Prime Day, and the impact of Prime Day is factored into this guidance. As far as new customers and new Prime members, we're not disclosing that, but suffice to say that it was a great day for both existing Prime members and also new customers who were trying us out for the first time.
Darin Manney - Director, Head of Investor Relations, Amazon
And on the stock-based compensation, you'll recall beginning in Q1 this year, we began allocating stock-based compensation and other operating expense to our North America, international and AWS segments. So we're including that in our guidance on operating income and have not separately guided to stock-based comp and other income expense this quarter.
Operator
Our next question comes from Gene Munster from Piper Jaffray.
Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray & Co.
Hey. Good afternoon. First, love the conference call format here. Get right to it. In terms of questions, the customer count, can you give us a little bit of guidance on that? And then also talk about the theme of automated consumption and separately, the importance of Prime Now and how you can kind of grow those SKUs. Thanks.
Darin Manney - Director, Head of Investor Relations, Amazon
Hi, Gene. This is Darin. I'll start with the customer accounts. As we noted again in our Q1 release, our active customer accounts exceeded 300 million. However, today we're not going to update that number.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
To your question on Prime Now, so I will point out Prime Now is now in more than 40 metro areas worldwide. In the past quarter we expanded further internationally to Germany, Spain and France, so it's a global program, again, offering free two-hour delivery on tens of thousands of items. We also have in the same vein of, I think what you called maybe automated consumption, the same day has expanded. Now we've added 11 metro areas, bringing the total to 27 metro areas that are qualified for same day. So, yeah, we think this is an important part of our Prime offering. We know customers love it. We're very happy with their order patterns from Prime Now, and very happy with it. Of course, we do always talk about – we always usually get asked about profitability and it is a very hard service to deliver and make money on, but we know customers love it and we're in a great position to do this because of our long-term approach, our drive of greater efficiencies and our proximity to the customer with our vast global FC network.
Operator
Our next question comes from Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs.
Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Thanks. I was wondering as it relates to the Q3 guidance, can you give us a bit of a sense of just how we should think about margins in the AWS business, especially as the next eight availability zones roll out? Presumably that kind of increase in capacity likely has an impact on margins, but would appreciate sort of any direction you can share on how to think about that.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure. We don't give – obviously we don't give segment-based guidance. But to your question about AWS, we actually see nine availability zones in four regions coming out in the next – in the coming year. The impact on short-term is pretty much indistinguishable from the growth that we're seeing in our expansion of our base customers in our existing regions, so we don't see a large step-up from the addition of new regions relative to the large and rapid growth in the business itself.
We do think that it does pay benefits both for ourselves and for our customers because of the expansion, and we're happy to have added the region in Mumbai this past quarter. We think when we expand geographically, existing customers will run more of their workloads on AWS. Sometimes they have local latency concerns or security issues that require them to run things in their country, so that helps. And we also open up to new customers when we add these regions. So not a large impact on Q3 guidance, but certainly an exciting investment for our customer base.
Operator
Our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein.
Carlos Kirjner-Neto - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Thank you. Two questions if I may. As I look at your tech and content expense as a percentage of revenues, we see year-on-year decline for the last two quarters, which is something we hadn't seen since mid-2010, and of course it's reflected in the AWS margins. Can you help us understand what has driven this significant change in relative trajectory in tech and content expenses? And the second question is, why is it that the rate at which you are deploying Prime Now is so much greater or faster than the rate at which you are deploying Fresh? What's different between them and how is it that you are deploying Fresh in new markets but not as fast as Prime Now, and what drives the difference? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure. On tech and content, that's going to be a combination of our people cost related to many areas of the website and also the infrastructure cost to run it, at both the Amazon Web Services and also the Amazon site. We've been seeing some great efficiencies in our infrastructure, both internally as Amazon and also as part of AWS. We have great people working on not only better efficiency, but also driving cost out of our acquisition prices. So, there's a lot of great work going on there and I think that's what you're seeing reflected in the tech and content line. Again, this can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, but we're happy with the current trend and you see it in the AWS margins.
On Prime Now versus Fresh, they are separate – sorry. The – we'll point out in Q2 that we added London and Boston as two new sites in London for AmazonFresh, and that was the first international location. But we've been running AmazonFresh for seven years, or excuse me, since 2007 in Seattle and what you've seen as we've been testing the model, we've been expanding in North America and more so we've been expanding within the cities that we're in, adding zip codes, adding additional customers. So, the move into Boston and also now into London give us some really good data points and as – it's a great customer feature for the Prime offering.
Prime Now is a little bit easier to build up from scratch, I would say. The – it has a different purpose, although some of the products overlap. Again, this is more about immediacy of one-hour and two-hour delivery of a curated list of important products that people need in a short period of time. So, they have different roles. Some of the products overlap, of course, but we're happy with both, and we think that customers like both of them.
Operator
Our next question is from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one is on the Echo. Anything you could share at all on some of the most commonly used searches? How are consumers using the Echo as of now most commonly? And then anything on uplift in purchase behavior from Echo households? And the second one on Prime, on AWS margins, can you just walk us through some of the puts and takes that have been driving the AWS margin expansion we've seen in the first half of this year? Is it utilization, product mixes? What's been driving the margin expansion? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure. Well, in Echo, again, we continue to build out the list of devices, launching the Dot and Tab and Fire TV skills this past year. And now we have 1,900 third-party skills for the Alexa, including new skills from Kayak, Lyft, NBC, Honeywell and more. So there's a lot of uses that we're seeing for Echo. A lot ties into our Prime Music offering. It's just a great way to access Prime Music and more and more the Amazon site. We don't have anything to disclose on physical orders from – through – excuse me, orders through Echo.
On Amazon Web Services margin, again, this is primarily due to efficiencies gained on our infrastructure, better utilization, better cost out. There is a – certainly a mix of products and services. I don't have a bridge for you on whether that's helpful or hurtful, but the – these margins in AWS will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, and that's what you're seeing. But we're very happy with the year-over-year improvement.
Operator
Next question is from Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Hey, Brian, could you give us some wise as to the revenue growth acceleration that you're seeing, a little more color about the revenue growth acceleration in North American retail and in international retail? I remember last quarter you called out really starting to see, kind of I don't know, critical mass tipping point, whatever the buzzword is, from Prime and from FBA in international markets. Is that what's continuing, I assume, to kind of drive that re-acceleration? And any geographic country comments behind that? Thanks a lot.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure. Yeah, I have the same buzzwords for you, Mark. It's really the flywheel of Prime is definitely working. It's simple as that. The low prices, vast selection and convenience continue to resonate with customers. Prime membership increases and selection through FBA makes Prime more valuable. So it's a bit as simple as that in the consumer business in North America and international, we are seeing great acceptance of Prime and usage of Prime benefits. We continue to expand the list of Prime benefits for customers to make it more valuable, and none is more valuable than FBA, which we've talked a lot about the value of Prime to FBA and vice-versa.
FBA is bringing more Prime-eligible selection to Prime and then the growth of Prime and the type of customers that utilize Prime and their buying behavior is a great traction for other FBA sellers. So that is essentially what we're seeing, and we're certainly pleased with the customer response to those offers globally.
Operator
Our next question comes from Youssef Squali from Cantor Fitzgerald.
Youssef Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities
Thank you. Two questions, please. Brian, your operating income has been come in stronger than expectations, but more importantly, stronger than your own guidance, at least in the last couple of quarters. I was just wondering as you look back at where you guided relative to actual, where do you think that delta was most pronounced? Why wouldn't we assume that maybe, at least on the margin, the investment intensity in the business has maybe decelerated a bit?
And second, on Prime Video, just was wondering, considering what the main competitor there is doing, i.e., expanding aggressively around the world, you guys have been growing in a more measured manner, is that still the plan or are you guys interested in maybe instead of moving into a few countries, kind of expand globally in one fell swoop? That's it. Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure. Let me start with the second question first. So on Prime Video, again we're very happy with the customer adoption of Prime Video, and we know the customers love it. We like the results that we see, particularly with the free trial conversion, the renewal rates for subscriptions. So it's clearly working. I mentioned earlier how we're doubling the investment rate in the second half of the year versus last year's second half, and we're tripling the Amazon Originals content.
That Originals content for TV and movies, that content can be used globally. We've talked a bit about our Prime launch in India, and alluded to the fact that we'll be having video soon in India, but local content and also Amazon Originals. So, stay tuned for that. I don't have any more to announce on that today. On the variance to guidance, what I'll say is, we came in the very high end of our revenue guidance. I would say that our business model usually reacts well to high volume as we get a really good leverage on our fixed expenses. So that's part of what we saw, very strong operating efficiencies as we hit essentially the highest end of our revenue guidance.
But we do have a lot of diverse profit streams here at Amazon and a lot of investments going on at any point in time. I think I heard a question there about level of investment. We continue to invest heavily. In fact, I just called out a few things that are going to be stepping up in investment levels in Q3, mostly ops and digital content. So we continue to invest on behalf of customers. But we also work very hard at efficiencies and scaling the businesses that we have. So we take both roles very seriously around here, investing on the right – in the right things, seeing results on behalf of customers, and also driving efficiencies. And there can be timing, quarter-to-quarter, the operating margin and levels of investment can fluctuate, but certainly continue to expand.
Operator
Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer. Mr. Helfstein, your line is live.
Ray Mcdonough - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Hi. Sorry about that. This is Ray McDonough on for Jason Helfstein. Just on the AWS side, we've been hearing a lot of talk and especially a lot of media reports that larger customers tend to use AWS, they might use Google and Microsoft Azure in tandem in sort of a multi-cloud kind of architecture. Just wondering your thoughts on how you see AWS fitting in the overall ecosystem and kind of your place longer term in the ecosystem.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure. Well, first of all, we believe customers will choose AWS primarily for three factors, the functionality and pace of innovation that we bring to the table, our partner and customer ecosystem and our experience. We've been in this business longer than anyone. Having said that, there are room – there's plenty of room for multiple vendors in this business. What we focus on is innovating on behalf of customers and expanding the geographic footprint to make our services more widely available.
You can see us continue to invest in things like new application services, higher up the stack, additional technologies that will make integrating with AWS seamless for those companies that have a hybrid IT environment and then continuing to add functionality for data analytics, mobile, Internet of things, machine learning offerings, things like that, that will add greater and greater value for AWS customers. And I would say the rapid pace of innovation continues to stretch our lead in that dimension. We have had 422 new significant services and features added in the first half of this year. That's a faster pace than last year when we added 722 services and features. So we feel good about the business position we're in and our position with customers.
Operator
Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian from Robert W. Baird.
Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay. Thanks, guys. As another follow up on the margins, I was hoping you could comment on any impact from the investments and build out of enhanced transportation capabilities including the air cargo leases. And then secondly, was hoping you could identify any categories within EGM that are becoming more meaningful drivers of growth or at least are an increasing focus on the retail side? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, sure. First, on EGM, I'll just say the growth is across a lot of different products, none to exactly call out here, and we think that a lot of it is, of course, driven by the growth of Prime itself. EGM in North America grew 32%, which was higher than the revenue growth rate, and also grew 36% internationally. So when people join Prime, they are certainly buying EGM in strong quantity. So that continues to grow with the growth of the Prime program.
On transportation, I think your question was about whether that's impacting our short-term results. No. The answer is no. We are certainly expanding our service offerings in the transportation side and we have been for many years, things like sortation centers and delivery methods. The plane deal that we were talking about is essentially planes that we're going to be leasing from other companies, and you'll hear more about that as we go forward, but that is to essentially take on the demand for internal flights as we move product around. It certainly will be well utilized.
Operator
Our next question comes from Brian Pitz from Jefferies.
Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC
Thanks for the questions. First, on FC build out, is the cost of building centers scaling over time given the use of Kiva, other technologies or general learnings, or are those costs still relatively consistent? And also, we noticed some device sellout in the next four to five weeks, post-Prime Day. Was this a bit of a planned inventory reduction for some of the devices or did volumes take you by surprise here?
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I will start with the second question. So I would just say Prime Day had enormous impact on the device business and devices were well featured and also well adopted by customers. So it was the largest device sales day that we've ever had and essentially pretty much across all of our device types, E-readers, tablets, Fire TV and Echo.
And I'm sorry. Your first question was around – the cost of fulfillment centers. Not disclosing that we do continue to change our fulfillment centers. We've changed, again, the automation, the size, the scale many times and we continue to learn and grow there. So no general trends I can point to on cost per fulfillment center to start up because they do vary in size and mission and some have fully outfitted in using Amazon Robotics, others – some don't for economic reasons. Maybe the volume is not perfect for robot volume. But yeah. But, yes, so I can't give you any real distinct trends there.

Our next question is from Justin Post from Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.
Great. Thank you. First on the customers, I'm guessing – I'm wondering why you aren't giving the number, a lot of people use it for their models. And then second thing, when you look at the U.S. Prime penetration versus total U.S. customers, how do you feel about that and do you think there's still a lot of room for Prime growth in the U.S.? Thank you.
Darin Manney - Director, Head of Investor Relations, Amazon
Hi, Justin. This is Darin. I'll comment on the customer accounts again. We may consider updating that in the future, but really we encourage you and our investors to look at our free cash flow measures, our revenue and our GAAP operating profit since our customer purchasing behavior can vary.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
And on Prime penetration, of course, we haven't released Prime subscription levels. We have talked about growth certainly globally and in North America. What I can tell you there is we still think there's a lot of room in Prime. We've tailored programs to students. We've tailored video programs. We've rolled out monthly plans. We have plans with grocery delivery. So there's a lot of different flavors of Prime and we are aggressively looking for a perfect Prime for everybody. We know that, again, when customers try Prime, they like it. So it's really just about getting them to try Prime and continuing to deliver great Prime benefits and great low prices and selection.

Our next question comes from Ross Sandler from Deutsche Bank.
Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thanks, guys. I just had two. First as a follow up on the logistics topic. So, in addition to the cargo planes you just mentioned for in-network moving products around, you guys have registered and received a U.S. Maritime license to operate as a freight forwarder and you recently announced this partnership with the UK for drone delivery that you've been working for a couple years. So I guess at a high level, can you just talk about the overall logistics strategy is evolving from trucks and fulfillment centers to incorporate some of these new methods and how that might impact your unit costs going forward?
And then the second question's on AWS. So you continue to put up really strong results. And you guys obviously talk to a lot of customers across lots of different verticals. Just a high level, what percent of enterprise workloads do you think have shifted to the public cloud at this stage? Is it low-single digit to mid-single-digit? And any color there on where we are in terms of penetration in the space. Thank you.
Darin Manney - Director, Head of Investor Relations, Amazon
So thank you, Ross. This is Darin. Let me take that first question on Prime Air in the UK, we've been working with and developing Prime Air for some time to develop a rapid delivery system that is safe, environmentally sound and it really enhances the services that we provide for millions of customers. And we're extremely happy to partner with the UK government to advance the safe use of drones for small parcel delivery. This is providing us with permission to trial new methods in the space, including beyond line-of-sight operation, sense-and-avoid technologies and flights where one person operates multiple drones.
So we definitely appreciate the pragmatic and forward-looking approach on this topic with the UK and we're going to continue to work with regulators and policy makers in many countries, including the U.S. So we're excited about there. As for the ocean-going licenses, we have no comment on that today.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
As far as AWS, essentially penetration question you asked. We think still very early. Again, we like our position, our industry leading position in the cloud space, and we're working on things that would incent more and more customers to accelerate their cloud conversion. The lower prices and services that we offer, and as I said, we'll work on things that will make it easier and easier for customers to work with us with their hybrid data centers or transfer their volume to us.

Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe one clarification and one big picture topic. On the clarification, appreciate the disclosure on content and how that'll double year-on-year in the second half. For purposes of just making sure we sort of can understand the trajectory, is there any way to frame it within second half of this year versus first half of this year, just so we can sort of try to triangulate on a gross margin basis from the content spend? And the bigger picture topic would be China, hasn't come up yet on the call. Wanted to understand your latest thoughts there on either the competitive landscape relative positioning in China and how you think about investments in China. Thank you.
Darin Manney - Director, Head of Investor Relations, Amazon
So, hi, Eric. This is Darin. I'll take the second question on China. So we continue to operate well in China. We see China as a – and the way we're approaching China as a way to – a trusted avenue for our Chinese customers to access authentic international brands and we'll focus on those global brands and bringing those to Chinese customers. Offerings like the Amazon Global Store where Chinese customers can access those international brands on the China website and have them shipped directly to their houses is something we're focused on. So, yeah, it's still early days and some of those experiments that we're doing, but we're seeing good traction on those things and we like that.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah and on the content spend, I think the only other data point I can give you is probably a dated one at this point, but we spent $1.3 billion in 2014, that's the last number that we disclosed and we continue to add content. The best I can give you at this point is that it will be double, nearly double what we spent in the second half of 2015.
Operator
Our final question will come from Victor Anthony from Axiom Capital.
Victor Anthony - Axiom Capital Management, Inc.
Thanks for putting me on. Maybe I'll just ask a question about India. You called out India was – you had the most visited e-commerce site as well as the most downloaded mobile app, and you also launched Prime. So maybe you could just talk about the opportunities and the challenges that you see in that market. And second, there was some press reports that you invested about $500 million of incremental capital in Italy. I was wondering what are you seeing in that market that justifies that level of investment.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure. So India, we're very encouraged by what we've seen so far in India, both with customers and also sellers; that's a (40:18) third-party seller market. You heard that we launched the Prime program this week, which will be a whole new experience for Indian customers. In hundreds of cities we'll now have unlimited free one-day and two-day delivery, and we also mentioned that Prime Video is coming there, both Indian and global content. We're also starting to see exclusive online sales partnerships. Recently, we've had partnerships with Motorola, Samsung, Lenovo on select phones. But more importantly, again, we really like the opportunity in India. We like the initial results that we see from customers and also sellers. We really like our team there. We have a great team of Amazonian's who've been very inventive in India.
Every time there's an obstacle or something that's different from the U.S. or another major business they'll invent around it, whether it's a shipping method or a payment method or whatever. So, very creative and the customer response has been really strong. So we are very excited about the Prime program. We think it'll enter into a new chapter in India, and we've seen great success every country in the world that we've launched Prime, and we feel India is going to be no different. So we're looking forward to seeing what we can do on behalf of the Indian customer.
Darin Manney - Director, Head of Investor Relations, Amazon
And hi, Victor, this is Darin. On Italy, yes, we continue to invest in Italy and really throughout Europe to keep pace with the strong customer demand we see. Since opening Italy in 2010, we've invested over €450 million and created 1,700 jobs in Italy, and this increased investment will be to add future FC near Rome and other infrastructure assets. So, yes, this is really to support both the customers that we have there in Italy and throughout Europe, and we'll continue to invest in the coming years.
Darin Manney - Director, Head of Investor Relations, Amazon

Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q1 2016 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.
For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please go ahead.
Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations
Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2016 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 28, 2016 only and will include forward-looking statement. Actual results may differ materially.
Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial result is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.
During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2015.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Brian.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 44% to $11.3 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $6.4 billion, up from $3.2 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less lease principal repayment increased to $3.5 billion, up from $1.5 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less finance lease principal repayment and assets acquired under capital leases increased to $1.6 billion, up from an outflow of $1.2 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.9 billion.
Capital expenditures do not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligation. These capital expenditures and capital leases reflect additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investment in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS, and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. A combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 490 million shares, compared with 483 million one year ago.
Worldwide revenue increased 28% to $29.1 billion or 29% excluding the $210 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide active customer accounts, excluding customers who only had preorders in the preceding 12-month period, exceeded $285 million. Worldwide paid unit growth was 27%. Worldwide seller units represented 48% of paid units.
Now, I'll talk about our segment results. In the first quarter of 2016, we began to allocate stock-based compensation and other operating expense net to our segment results. These amounts are combined and titled stock-based compensation and other in our segment results and reflect the way we now evaluate our business performance and manage our operations. For reference, this quarter, I'll also mention segment operating income excluding stock-based compensation and other.
In the North America segment, revenue grew 27% to $17 billion. Media revenue grew 8% to $3.2 billion. EGM revenue grew 32% to $13.5 billion. North America segment operating income, including stock-based compensation and other, was $588 million, a 3.5% operating margin compared with $254 million in the prior year. This includes $5 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. North America segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $924 million, a 5.4% operating margin compared with $517 million in the prior year.
In the International segment, revenue grew 24% to $9.6 billion. Excluding the $177 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 26%. Media revenue increased 7% to $2.5 billion or 9% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 31% to $7 billion or 33% excluding foreign exchange. International segment operating loss, including stock-based compensation and other, was $121 million, compared with a loss of $194 million in the prior year. This includes $21 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. International segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $20 million, compared with a loss of $76 million in the prior year.
In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 64% to $2.6 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income, including stock-based compensation and other, was $604 million, a 23.5% operating margin compared with $195 million in the prior year. This includes $24 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Amazon Web Services segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $716 million, a 27.9% operating margin compared with $265 million in the prior year. Our operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. Operating income was $1.1 billion or 3.7% of revenue, up approximately 260 basis points year-over-year. This includes $50 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.
Consolidated segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $1.7 billion or 5.7% of revenue, compared to $706 million in the prior year. Our income tax expense was $475 million. Net income was $513 million or $1.07 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $57 million or a loss of $0.12 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.1 billion year-over-year to $15.9 billion. Inventory increased 30% to $9.6 billion and inventory turns were 8.6, down from 8.8 turns a year ago as we expand selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 26% to $15 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 72 from 70 in the prior year.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we describe in more detail on our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on our results. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisition, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q2 2016, we expect net sales of between $28 billion and $30.5 billion, or growth of between 21% and 32%. This guidance anticipates approximately 70 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. Operating income to be between $375 million and $975 million compared with $464 million in the second quarter of 2015. This includes approximately $825 million for stock-based compensation and other operating expense net. We are grateful to our customers and remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions.
Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations
Great. Thanks, Brian. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. Thank you. Our first question is from Mark May of Citi. Please state your question.
Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Thanks a lot. Lots here, but international retail revenue – the international retail segment really stood out. Revenue accelerated. Seemed like a bit of a milestone also that the CSOI turned positive in a non-Q4 quarter. Can you shed any more light in what the key driver there was and how sustainable it is? And AWS, just mathematically, the comps get tougher starting in Q2, just given what happened in 2014. Is that something that we should be taking into account in terms of thinking about how the rest of the year may progress? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure. Your first question on international, yes, all three segments had very strong growth in the quarter. International's 26% FX-neutral growth rate was actually the strongest we've seen in three and a half years. I would attribute it to the Prime flywheel. As we may have mentioned in the past, we feel that Europe and large countries in Europe and Japan are a few years behind the U.S. on a lot of the key Prime metrics, but we also said last year that Prime subscriptions were up 51% year-over-year in 2015, 47% in the U.S. and a higher rate than that internationally. So certainly, a lot going on in international, a lot that's really good, adding Prime subscribers at a high clip, continuing to add selection at FBA sellers. So you'll see devices, you see video content. So it's the whole array of Prime offering, Prime Now, Same-Day. Everything is in Europe. It may be getting there a little slower than the starting point in the U.S. but we see it really showing up in customer engagement and customer purchases.
On the AWS side, I think the 2016 to 2015 comparison probably stands on its own and 2014 falls by the wayside, so I would encourage you to look at recent trends. We don't forecast obviously by segment.
Operator
Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth, JPMorgan. Please state your question.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask you about unit growth overall and if we look back over the last three quarters, you've accelerated it now to a materially higher level than what we saw in 2014 and the first half of 2015, and I realize in 3Q last year you had Prime Day. But I just was hoping you could comment on the overall acceleration we've seen here and key drivers behind that? And if there's something different perhaps than what you talked about on international? And then just also on AWS and can you just talk about the underlying drivers here of margins and thinking about that a little bit going forward primary sources of leverage? And as you open up six new regions in coming months, should we expect this to be constant build-out or something that's more lumpy over time and more in waves? Thanks.
Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations
This is Phil Hardin. I'll take the units question. So really the units are driven by very similar trends to what Brian described. I think when we look at the bridges for revenue, and obviously units are a key driver of revenue, things like Prime are key in that bridge. I would also call out selection growth, that's been a big area of focus for us. And one important way we drive selection is through FBA, and so we continue to be very pleased with the progress we're making in FBA. What that means for our Prime customers is there's more for them to choose from, obviously that gives them more they can purchase, it makes Prime more valuable. For sellers, it means they sell more. And so I would say that FBA is helping drive some of the selection growth we're seeing here, so selection growth and Prime though are two very key drivers of our growth.
On the second part, I think that, Brian...
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, one other comment I didn't say earlier, I do want to point out that because of the leap year there's an extra day in Q1. Every company would have seen this obviously, but we estimated it was worth about 150 basis points to our growth rate revenue. That would be consistent with North America and international. Your other comment was on – or question was on AWS and a bit about margins and margin outlook. We're very pleased with the quarter, we came in at 23.5% operating margin on a – the new basis including stock-based compensation and other. We're very pleased. But stepping back with the 64% growth in AWS which is now a $10 billion business, but on the margin side, I would caution you that we're pleased but it is very early to start drawing too many conclusions on the long-term margins in this business, they'll be bumpy over time. At any point in time they're going to reflect the balance of investing including global expansion that he's talked about, price reductions we may offer, and also driving cost efficiency, which for us is a very important driver in not only this business but also the North America and international segments.
Operator
Our next question is from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.
Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Thanks. Looking at the active customer account number, it looks like growth slowed pretty significantly, about 10 percentage points. Just curious if you can give us a sense of anything that might be throwing that number off, assuming we're reading it the right way? And then, as you roll out on AWS – as you roll out the fixed new Availability Zones over the course of this year, is there a way to quantify what kind of an impact that's going to have on the capacity at AWS?
Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations
So I'll take the first part of your question about active customers. So as we look at our metrics and what information we provide each year, we often make some changes. So this quarter, we only gave the active customers with a paid purchase in the trailing 12 months, and so that number was more than $285 million. I think that's pretty similar to the trends that we've seen in that metric.
Now in the past, sometimes we had also given a total active customers count, and so that number for this quarter was over $310 million. So that may be where you're making the statement about the slowdown in growth, but the trajectory was very similar from prior quarters for both of those numbers. But we opted just to give the other one, but you now have the number for the total number of customers.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
And on your AWS footprint question, so we ended the quarter with 33 Availability Zones in 12 geographic regions, and we have five – 11 more Availability Zones opening in the next year. The impact on capital, yes, there will be additional capital investment as we built out those zones. Some of it has already taken place. But I will also say that by and large, the largest increases in capital leases is to support the growth of incremental usage of customers we have now and agreements we have now. So – and you should expect to see us continue to invest and support this business. We're very, very – we have a leadership position, we intend to maintain it and we're very excited about where we are.
Operator
Our next question is from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Two, please. The first one is on Prime. You've two straight years of around 50% Prime subscriber growth. Just curious about how you think about keys to driving Prime sub-growth going forward and the thought process behind the reported monthly Prime subscription?
And the second one on logistics investments, so there's been a lot about truck investments and logistics investments. Any comments at all about learnings and what you're seeing from some of the investments in your truck fleet and your own delivery network? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, let me start with the Prime. Yes, we have had very strong growth the last two years and earlier, obviously on Prime growth of members. I would say it's a culmination of a lot of separate investments that we're making. So if you look at the success of our devices, we are seeing tablets where we sold twice the volume in Q1 year-over-year. Fire TV Stick, you may have read in our press release that it has greater than 100,000 customer reviews, the most reviewed product ever, 62,000 or over 62,000 of those reviews are five-star reviews. We've not only had the Echo, but we have the Echo Dot and Tab, so we're branching off that product line and having trouble keeping those in stock.
And of course we launched the new Kindle Oasis e-reader. So that is an important part of the story. As it is with digital content, you may have seen the recent announcements that we're working on a great amount of new content for Prime members. We love the – customers love the content and we like the results we see, particularly around Prime free trial conversion and renewal rates for subscribers who use and take advantage of Prime.
So beyond the awards that the content is winning and the success we're having with Amazon, particularly our Amazon Originals, we feel that program is working. We're going to significantly increase our spend in that area. Some of that is in Q2, you'll see that more in the next few quarters. But we think that's working and look forward to bringing a lot of new content to our Prime subscriber base, both through our normal Prime subscription and also the monthly plan that you alluded to.
Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations
This is Phil Hardin and I'll jump in on the second part of your question. So for the trucks, it – really it's trailers. The typical use case is running a lag between a fulfillment center and a sort center. So we're running enough volume there that we're using trucks already. We thought it made sense to go ahead and buy some trailers, we're actually still contracting out for the truck part. And it gives us flexibility, we think the economics will make sense over time.
Similarly, we've announced an agreement to lease some airplanes with Air Transport Services Group, an agreement to lease up to 20 Boeing 767s there, and similar use case, it's products that are already boxed. And we think again, this is activities we've been doing already which need to grow at a very rapid rate. This gives us extra capacity and we think it's good to be able to deliver to customers, and we think it makes sense over the long-term.
Operator
Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Please state your question.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great. Two questions related to Prime overseas. Could you talk about the status of Prime in international markets? How far rolled out it is in most of your major markets? And then, you talk about Prime flywheels, and you did last year. But it seems likes those flywheels spun faster than you expected in the fourth quarter of last year that caused some near-term expense issues for you? Can you talk about how you're thinking about planning against that as the Prime flywheels are getting broader for you, how do you try to get ahead of that into the peak season later this year? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, sure. Let me – this is Brian. Let me start with the second question first. It wasn't necessarily the Prime flywheel that was the issue, it was more the FBA demand that we had from FBA sellers for space in our warehouses. We were very full. It was a high-class problem to have. But it – as I mentioned last quarter, it did result in higher fulfillment costs in the fourth quarter as a result, and I think you'll see some of that dissipated now in Q1, so you could tell it was a Q4 issue. We learn from every Q4, this one was no exception. We are already making plans for a smoother Q4 next year. We will continue to add fulfillment capacity, we will work with FBA sellers on inventory stocking and timing and we think that there's things that we can do better as we do every year, come out of fourth quarter with immense learnings.
Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations
This is Phil. On the Prime question, we launched Prime in the U.S. in 2005, followed that in 2007 with U.K., Germany, Japan, and then other countries after. We have Prime in all of the countries where we have Marketplaces with the exception of Mexico, China and India. And Prime is really in varying stages in those countries. We have some kind of an expedited shipping offer in all of them. Here in the U.S., we've been talking quite a bit about Prime Now, that's also in Italy and Japan and the U.K. at this point and not others, also varying levels of digital benefits as well.
So, generally, the international countries are not as far along with selection or the fullness of the digital offers. We've got Prime Video in the U.K., in Germany and Japan. Music is not fully rolled out yet to all of the others there. So that's where we are with Prime.
Operator
Our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein. Please state your question.
Carlos Kirjner-Neto - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Thank you. I have two. I think it's the first time since 1Q 2011 that we see tech and content as a percentage of revenue declining or flat. Is this just a sign of your inability to increase investment in line with revenue growth? Or is there something else going on and if yes, what?
And secondly, Brian, you said that the growth of Prime has been driven by investments you have made and are making. And you gave the examples of devices that you guys are selling. I think it's a mathematical certainty that Prime subscribers will decelerate in North America at some point from 50% growth. As penetration increases and growth slows, will we see a deceleration in the investment levels? And in other words, how do we think about the effect of deceleration in Prime on the North American margin structure in the future? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure. Let me start with that second one. So we think there's a lot of room to grow in not only our international countries, but also in the U.S. So we plan on continuing to build the benefits of the Prime program from music to video, to two-day shipping, to same-day shipping, to Prime Now. So I don't see that dissipating. And again, it remains the best deal in retail. So hopefully everyone signs up for that.
On the tech and content question, I don't have a lot to call out in the quarter. I would say there's no let-up in the pace of invention here, particularly on the AWS side. We usually quote the number of new features and services to you each quarter, we had 214 in Q1, up from 170 the first quarter of last year. So over 26% growth in this quarter alone coming off a year where I believe the number was 722 significant new features and services delivered for AWS customers last year.

Our next question comes from Brian Pitz of Jefferies. Please state your question.
Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC
Thanks for the question. Any comments on your business in India? How is that market ramping up? And maybe on the competitive front there, any sense of where the local incumbents may actually have some advantage in the region? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, sure. Thanks. Actually, I just returned from India where I spent a week with our teams in Bangalore and Hyderabad. We're breaking ground on a new 10-acre campus there. So we are solidifying and increasing our investment in India on all fronts. I had a chance to see firsthand the level of invention going on with both customers and sellers, making deliveries to customers, seeing the I Have Space program we have with merchants. It's a very exciting time in India and again, the invention is off the charts. We are inventing things in India that do not exist in other parts of the country – excuse me, parts of the world. And the team there is one of our best.
You can see it in some of the external commentary as well. For the second year in a row customers selected Amazon India as Amazon's most trusted online shopping brand. During the quarter, we rolled out a feature called Tatkal which is a studio on wheels that we go to the sellers to help them sign up. We let them do registration, imaging, catalog, uploads and basic seller training. So we're taking it to the sellers, taking the business to the sellers. We've already reached sellers in 25 cities and we're really helping them expand their business not only within their home region, but throughout the whole country.

Our next question comes from Justin Post of Merrill Lynch. Please state your question.
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.
Thanks. My question is on the international margins. They're quite a bit below where they were many years ago and trailing the U.S. Maybe talk about the dynamics there and what is it going to take to catch up over time? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure. So, on the op margin side, although there was improvement year-over-year and, yeah, you're right, it is still on FX-neutral basic – basis negative. We have, as I said earlier, selection expansion, infrastructure investments, fulfillment network and AWS – excuse me, that's not the international segment – fulfillment network and digital content. So we continue to build the underpinnings of the Prime program in our international countries. You also have to keep in mind that we're making large investments in India. We're very excited about what we see and we will continue to invest heavily in India.

Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Please state your question.
Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. I just had two questions on AWS. First, last fall at re:Invent, you guys disclosed that data management revenue was at a $1 billion run rate. So can you provide an update on that figure? And maybe just talk about how much of AWS revenue today is outside of the storage and compute layers.
And then the second question is on the AWS margin. So I think everybody is trying to learn more about the structural long-term margin, and it was down a tad quarter-on-quarter. So is that solely from FX impact? Or was there some seasonality of expenses? Any color on what's driving the AWS margin and how we should think about that over the longer term? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I'll take your second question first. So again, we had margin expansion year-over-year that was quite significant, from 12.4% to 23.5%. But again, it's very early in this business. We're very pleased with the results we're seeing on the top and bottom line, but margins are going to be bumpy and affected by levels of investing, price reductions and also cost efficiencies that we're driving. So quarter-to-quarter, it will vary. We are concerned at this point about capital efficiency, returning price to customers periodically with price reductions and adding feature sets for them to make the business more valuable.
Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations
This is Phil. For your other part of your question, we're not providing an update on the $1 billion stat. What I would say is that the AWS team has strong revenue growth across their suite of products. The fastest-growing product in their history is actually Aurora, the new database. So we're very excited about what we're seeing in that space but we're not breaking out the revenue for those various components today.

Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS Investment Research. Please state your question.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question. Looking at the gross margin, impressive performance in Q1. There were a few headwinds it looked like in gross margin in Q4. Wanted to understand how we should think about the puts and takes in gross margin, it has evolved to be a much higher number over the last couple of years, what some of the puts and takes are going forward especially with respect to content costs? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure. So I don't have a forecast for you on content costs in isolation or really forward looks on anything besides the guidance I've given you. But, yes, it hits in the gross margin, content costs do show up there. I think the bigger issues that you should look at in gross margin, and again starting with the comment that we expanded by 300 basis points year-over-year, that is really driven by, first of all, the AWS growth and again, $10 billion business growing 64% is very – we're very pleased with that and that affects gross margin as well.
The other bigger element though is the third-party contribution. Third-party units are now up to 48% of paid units and that's up 400 basis points year-over-year, so that continues to be a factor in gross margin. Again, we book that on a net basis. The third-party revenue, it's a positive factor in gross margin and can be a negative factor in fulfillment costs and some of the other metrics.
Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations
This is Phil. Also just to jump in. The gross margin is not the primary metric we use to measure the business. We are much more focused on free cash flow dollars and operating profit dollars. So there are a whole lot of moving parts in gross margin, and Brian mentioned a lot of them. But it's not a primary metric for us.

Our next question comes from Aaron Kessler of Raymond James. Please state your question.
Aaron M. Kessler - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Great, thanks. Couple of questions. First, if you can just update us on maybe your new advertising initiatives in terms of how the sponsored links are performing? Additionally, if you can just – maybe just give us an update on Prime Now, it seems like you've rolled out a number of cities for that. How that's evolving and the traction with Prime Now? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
So, we're very excited about the advertising business, and we think it's still very early days for this opportunity. So it's an offering we've been working on. We're trying to take a very customer-centric approach. You probably noticed some changes in the treatment on the website. And we did move away from text ads and product ads in favor of some of the other newer products. And we are really excited about the opportunity there is for third-party sellers, and for other vendors on the site. But we are not breaking out numbers today.
Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations
In Prime Now, we are now in 30 metro areas, really from a standing start 16 months ago when we opened our first Prime Now location and it's now a worldwide business in the U.S., U.K., Italy and Japan. So the five cities we added in the first quarter were Raleigh, North Carolina, Cincinnati, Tampa, Liverpool, England, and Osaka, Japan. So, yeah, how do we feel about that business? Again, it offers tens of thousands of daily essential products. We think it's a service that customers like, certainly is hard for companies to do. We think the natural evolution of our operations network and our scale gives us a chance to do this and we are happy to invest in it as a service for our customers. We are taking a long-term approach on this one, though.

Our next question comes from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Please state your question.
Steve D. Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Okay. Hi. Thanks. So your capital lease-driven property and equipment acquisitions is down again year-over-year. So, will you help tie this to perhaps the overall usage growth at AWS? Or maybe the changing nature of how your enterprise customers may be using the platform to be more compute versus storage or database-heavy? And I think historically on the e-commerce side, you guys have been price followers as opposed to price leaders. AWS, you have been price leaders for the most part for actively taking down price. So, now, given your leadership position, do you think you'll continue to be price leaders? Or do you think it's now time (35:09)?
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Let me start with your CapEx question. So we like to look at both capital expenditures and capital leases because they are both essentially levels with our level of investment. Those totaled $9.5 billion in the trailing 12 months, and it was up 7% from the 12-month period ending this quarter last year. I will point out that the prior year was $6.1 billion. So we have stepped up investment, although it did not go up as much year-over-year this quarter, we are still spending almost $10 billion on what essentially is fulfillment capacity in support of really strong growth, unit growth and FBA, and global expansion and then also on AWS, additional capacity for existing customers as they grow their business and also new regions.
We've been working and continue to work very hard on capital productivity. It's very important to us, and I attribute a good piece of the ability to keep that at a modest growth rate year-over-year to our capital efficiency, and better purchasing across all capital and capital leases quite frankly. But again, we are spending almost $10 billion. So...
Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations
And, Stephen, this is Phil. Just to jump on the usage growth comment, we continue to see really strong usage growth. We are not in the business of raising prices, we lower prices for AWS, so there can be mix for products, but by and large, if you see our revenue growth, know that we are also lowering prices which means that by math, we are typically going to be growing usage at a very strong rate. So I just wanted to jump on that.

Our next question comes from John Blackledge of Cowen & Company. Please state your question.
John Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks. So the North American EGM segment outperformed our expectations of growth accelerating on a year-over-year basis. Given you don't break out GMV by vertical within the EGM segment and just given the strong growth at massive scale, can you cite any key verticals that were particularly strong?
And second question is just an update on Fresh. Rollout has obviously been much slower than Prime Now. How should we think about the Fresh rollout and the impact over the long-term? Thank you.
Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations
This is Phil. I'll take the EGM question first. So just to put numbers on that, the year-over-year in the U.S. or in North America was 32% growth, which was up from 28% in Q4. And there's not any single categories we're calling out there. To grow on a base that big, that kind of rate, you really need pretty strong performance across the board. So a lot of categories are selling a lot. And it's a lot of the drivers we talked about, as Brian mentioned on the revenue growth side, Prime, selection, growth. And we also benefited from the extra day in the quarter due to the leap year, but strong performance from many of the categories.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes. And on AmazonFresh, we continue to have a strong Fresh business in a number of cities in the U.S. We know customers love it. We're making good progress on the economics. And you'll also notice that we have other ways for people to buy consumable products. We have Prime Pantry. We have Prime Now. So we're playing with a lot of different models to see what resonates with consumers and it'll guide our investment decisions going forward.

Our next question comes from Ben Schachter of Macquarie Equities Research. Please state your question.
Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
First, congratulations on a great quarter. A couple on Prime and one on China. First, a point of clarification. You answered a previous question by saying that you will significantly increase investment in Prime. Was that in reference specifically to video or should we expect new types of offerings beyond video and music?
And then, secondly on Prime, membership is likely hitting some saturation levels for certain demographics in the U.S.? Do you intend to focus on more lower income households for growth there? And then finally, quickly on China, anything notable to call out there that's been different over the recent past driving results, the free trade zone, et cetera?
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I'll take the first question on content. Yes. My comment on Prime benefits was essentially one about video content and our investment there, not saying other investments may not go up as well, but that is the one that we are focusing on and that I called out.
On the comment about Prime, I guess what I'll call availability or...
Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations
Saturation.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
...saturation, yeah, I think that's one of the thoughts behind our monthly plan. We want to create flexibility for consumers to try Prime in a low-cost way, if that's how they choose. We've always had our free trial program, but it is a hurdle for many people or there's a hesitancy to put up a full year's payment for a year of Prime. Annual is still going to be a better deal but we know that customers may try it more frequently if it's a monthly plan, and that's what we're looking for. We know that once customers try it, generally, they'll really like it. So we think that will purge (40:38) some other demographic groups as well.
Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations
This is Phil. Another comment on Prime. On your saturation question, keep in mind that even in the U.S., which is our most mature by years of launch, we still grew last year at 47% year-over-year membership growth, and we continue to make the program better and better. I think the monthly offers are great for flexibility, give people a chance to try new ways. And we continue to add content. We continue to add selection. Prime Now is a huge benefit that didn't even exist two years ago. So all these things are making the program better and we're still out trying to meet as many customers as possible. We're obviously very committed to driving Prime and it's important to the company.
Your question on China, probably the biggest thing to point to is more progress and selection on the Amazon global store. So this is our website. This is the offer that allows Chinese customers to shop from the U.S. website, Amazon.com, with prices in RMB and with Chinese-language pages. So it's focused on really items that may be hard to get, and Amazon's really trying to become the trusted source for many of these goods. So really that's a big part of the focus. And if you've been tracking that number over time, we're now up over $10 million, which is good progress on that front.

Our next question comes from Ron Josey of JMP Securities. Please state your question.
Ron Victor Josey - JMP Securities LLC
Great. Thanks for taking the question. I want to go back to North America but this time just focus on margins. 5.5%, 5.4% margins, I think that's the highest level since maybe 2Q 2010 and resumes the margin expansion we saw really for most of last year. So just hoping we can understand – help us understand a little bit more what's driving that? I'm sure the more mature Prime flywheel you mentioned that's happening in Europe. But is there anything else that's going on besides Prime flywheel, maybe more efficient shipping or things along those lines? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I'll start. I think you see the growth rate of the segment at 27%. It's showing the success we're having with customers. When we grow at that clip, we can do a lot of good things it. We can – on the cost side, we run our facilities more efficiently, we can buy better, we can look to in-source some things that we may have paid externally for. So, there's a number of things that we can do that I think will show up on the bottom line. But principally, what we're trying to do now is – again, make the Prime experiences as strong as possible for consumers.
Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations
This is Phil. The other thing I would add to that is that the margin you see in any quarter is really the output of our rate of investment at some places and drive for efficiencies in others. And we're not really trying to optimize for any particular number in a given quarter. We're just trying to make the best decisions we can to grow long-term free cash flow per share. And so, again, we're juggling the investment in the places where we feel like we have long-term opportunities where we need to invest with making sure we're getting continuously better in all our other processes at the same time.

Our final question will come from Bob Peck of SunTrust. Please state your question.
Robert S. Peck - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Yes. Hi. Thank you. Just two quick ones. Just back to India for a second, I was wondering if you could talk about the regulatory environment there and particularly how it pertains to Amazon Cloudtail. And then number two, on logistics, could you talk about excess capacity in logistics as you build out air, freight, sea, et cetera. And would you ever entertain delivering other companies' items, i.e., like a FedEx or UPS? Thanks.
Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations
This is Phil. I'll take the India question. We're happy to see the recent clarifications and we're happy to operate in any regime. So frankly, the more clarity, the better.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
And then on the logistics question, stepping back, the reason we add logistics capability and transportation capability is so we can serve our customers faster and faster delivery speeds and we've needed to add more of our own capacity to supplement our carriers and our partners. They're still, again, great partners, have been and will continue to be for the future, but we see opportunities where we need to add additional capacity and we're filling those voids.
Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations
Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2015 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please go ahead.
Phil Hardin
Hello and welcome to our Q4 2015 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's view as of today, January 28, 2016 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.
During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2014.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Brian.
Brian Olsavsky
Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-months operating cash flow increased 74% to $11.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $7.3 billion, up from $1.9 billion.
Trailing 12-month free cash flow less lease principle repayments increased to $4.7 billion, up from $529 million. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less finance lease principle repayments and assets acquired under capital leases increased to $2.5 billion, up from an outflow of $2.2 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.6 billion.
Capital expenditures does not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. These capital expenditures and capital leases reflect additional investments in support of continued business growth, due to investments in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS, and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 490 million shares, compared with 483 million one year ago. Worldwide revenue increased 22% to $35.7 billion, or 26% excluding the $1.2 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 26%.
Worldwide active customer accounts were approximately 304 million. Excluding customers who only had free orders in the preceding 12-month period, worldwide active customer accounts were approximately 280 million, up from approximately 254 million in the comparable prior year period.
Worldwide paid Prime members increased 51% year-over-year. Worldwide seller units represented 47% of paid units. Fulfillment by Amazon or FBA units represented nearly 50% of seller units. Worldwide active Amazon Web Services customers exceeded 1 million.
Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $24.3 billion or 68.1% of revenue, compared with 70.5%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $9.7 billion or 27.1% of sales, up approximately 100 basis points year-over-year.
Fulfillment was $4.4 billion or 12.3% of revenue, compared with 11.3%. Tech and content was $3.2 billion or 9% of revenue, compared with 8.2%. Marketing was $1.7 billion or 4.8% of revenue, compared with 5.1%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results. As a reminder, in the first quarter we changed our reportable segments to report North America, international, and Amazon web services. Consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments, our stock-based compensation, or the other operating expense line item.
In the North America segment, revenue grew 24% to $21.5 billion. Media revenue grew 11% to $3.9 billion or 12% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 28% to $17.3 billion.
North America segment operating income was $1 billion, a 4.7% operating margin, compared with $733 million in the prior year period. North America segment operating income includes $6 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.
In the international segment, revenue grew 12% to $11.8 billion. Excluding the $1.1 billion year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 22%. Media revenue decreased 3% to $3.3 billion or increased 5% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 19% to $8.5 billion or 31% excluding foreign exchange.
International segment operating income was $60 million, compared with $65 million in the prior year. International segment operating income includes $47 million of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.
In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 69% to $2.4 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income was $687 million, a 28.5% operating margin, compared with $240 million in the prior year period. AWS segment operating income includes $60 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.
Consolidated segment operating income was $1.8 billion or 4.9% of revenue, up approximately 140 basis points year-over-year. CSOI includes $20 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 88% to $1.1 billion.
Our income tax expense was $453 million. GAAP net income was $482 million or $1 per diluted share, compared with a net income of $214 million and $0.45 per diluted share.
Now I'll discuss the full year results. Revenue increased 20% to $107 billion or 26% excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. North America revenue grew 25% to $63.7 billion or 26% excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. International revenue grew 6% to $35.4 billion or 21% excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange.
Excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange, Germany revenue grew 18%. Japan revenue grew 19%, and UK revenue grew 16%. AWS revenue grew 70% to $7.9 billion.
Consolidated segment operating income was $4.5 billion or 4.2% of revenue, up approximately 220 basis points year-over-year. CSOI includes $16 [ph] million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income was $2.2 billion, compared with $178 million in the prior year.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.4 billion year-over-year to $19.8 billion. Inventory increased 23% to $10.2 billion. And inventory turns were 8.5, down from 8.6 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels, and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 24% to $20.4 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 77 from 73 in the prior year.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions.
Our results are inherently unpredictable, and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy, and customer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on guidance.
Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, recording further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.
For Q1 2016, we expect net sales of between $26.5 billion and $29 billion or growth of between 17% and 28%. This guidance anticipates approximately 130 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates.
GAAP operating income to be between $100 million and $700 million, compared with $255 million in first quarter of 2015. This includes approximately $600 million for stock-based compensation and other operating expenses net.
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense net, to be between $700 million and $1.3 billion, compared with $706 million in the first quarter of 2015.
We are grateful to our customers and remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first, is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions.
Phil Hardin
Great. Thanks, Brian. Let's move onto the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is coming from analyst Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Stephen Ju
Hey, thanks. So Brian, I think in the past you've given some indication as to what usage growth may be at AWS. I was wondering if you have an update for that in the fourth quarter.
And secondarily, is there any way to characterize what the pricing environment is right now for AWS as well? Thank you.
Brian Olsavsky
Yes, thanks, Stephen. No, I don't have a usage growth number for you. We'll say we're - it's been very strong. And AWS revenue is on a, just short of a $10 billion run rate at the end of Q4.
As far as pricing is concerned, we had a price reduction in January for our EC2 services. It was our 51st price reduction since we launched AWS years ago. And generally what we find is that price is important. But so is speed and agility for customers and the ability to deliver services and features that were beneficial to them.
I will point out that we added 722 new features and services in 2015 and that was up 40% year-over-year. So we feel we have a lead in this space and we don't take it for granted and we want to serve customers better each year.
Stephen Ju
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from analyst Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.
Jason Helfstein
Thank you. Can you talk a little bit about the dynamics in fourth quarter eCommerce, particularly in the US? Did we see more aggressive promotional activity and maybe talk about how you tried to work that to continue to drive the Prime number of members going forward? Thanks.
Brian Olsavsky
Sure. Well, what I can say is our approach to pricing has not changed. And through Q4 [ph] we did everything we could to have the best prices available for customers and in stock in time for the holiday.
Another dynamic of Q4 was that it was a huge FBA quarter, nearly 50% of our third party units were FBA and our third party units were also up to 47% of our paid units, up 400 basis points year-over-year.
So a really strong quarter for our FBA sellers using our FBA services. It did put a lot of demands on our warehouses and we were full. It was a very busy quarter and it did increase some of our variable costs as a result, primarily in the US, but a very strong quarter for FBA. It exceeded our - even our expectations.
Jason Helfstein
Perhaps how are you able to integrate that into holiday promotions?
Brian Olsavsky
I'm sorry. You cut off there. Could you repeat your question?
Jason Helfstein
Sure. Just any additional color around Prime and how you were able to integrate that into holiday promotions?
Brian Olsavsky
Nothing specific. I will say, you know, one interesting enhancement this year was our Prime Now service, which allowed people order in selected markets up until 11.59 on New Year, excuse me, Christmas Eve. So that was a valuable service to many late shoppers, last-minute shoppers.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.
Aram Rubinson
Hey. Thanks very much. Two questions both on the logistics side. It seems pretty clear that you guys are trafficking in some old world assets, like truck trailers and ship lanes and air fields.
Can you help give us a sense as to maybe what we're trying to accomplish with that, if it's defensive to protect your service to your existing customers or if you're looking to maybe start new businesses with those assets?
Brian Olsavsky
Sure, Aram. Thanks for your question. I would say what we've found is in order to serve – properly serve our customers at peak. We've needed to add more of our own logistics to supplement our existing partners. That's not meant to replace them.
And those carriers are just not - no longer able to handle all of our capacity that we need at peak. They have been and continue to be great partners. And we look forward to working with them in the future.
It's just we've had to add some resources on our own. You mentioned trucks. The Amazon trucks, we did invest in those - this past year. We use those primarily for movement between our warehouses and our source centers.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Nowak
Thanks for taking my questions. I've got two. The first one is just on gross margins. I think they were down of about 200 basis points sequentially. It's the biggest fall in the fourth quarter in quite sometime. Anything you call out there, is the devices are more - sortation center, is anything pressuring gross margins we should think about in the fourth quarter?
And then on the fulfillment line, you mentioned FBA being a big driver of the growth in the fulfillment costs. Anything else you would call out leading to incremental fulfillment costs, maybe India or something else? Thanks.
Brian Olsavsky
No. And again, keep in mind that the fulfillment as a percent of revenue is impacted by the calculation of FBA revenue being a net number as opposed to a full revenue number. But our fulfillment costs per unit actually decreased year-over-year. It just we are now shipping more and more of our, other demand out of our warehouses, because of the strength in retail and FBA.
On gross margin, I would - first I'll caution you and say, we would encourage you to look at free cash flow, which was – grew at minimum of $4 billion on each of the metrics that we point out and our profit which was up 88% year-over-year.
If you look sequentially, also keep in mind that in Q3 when it was up 500 basis points year-over-year, that was lapping the write-down of our Amazon phone [ph] inventory the prior year. So there is a little bit of noise in the Q3 number.
But generally, again, we're happy with the ability to service customers, the reaction of customers in Q4, and the bottom line results that we had.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird Equity Research. Please proceed with your question.
Colin Sebastian
Great, thanks. One follow-up and then another question. On the logistics and transportation side, I was curious if that's to date just to supplement some of the other carriers. But more broadly or longer term, is there an ambition from the services side to perhaps provide capacity to other companies.
And then on AWS margins, I was just wondering if we should expect more leverage there going forward and whether Q1, whether that should demonstrate some seasonality versus what we've seen in terms of sequential growth in prior years? Thank you.
Brian Olsavsky
Sure. Let me work backwards. We don't give guidance by segment. So we cannot really comment on AWS specifically in Q1. And the operational improvements, excuse me, the gross margin, operating margin year-over-year that we've seen in the AWS business has been heavily driven by operating efficiencies, both purchase reductions and purchase prices and also efficiency in driving greater utilization of the assets that we have.
So we're very happy with that. Keep in mind that we did have a - although the year-over-year increase in capital expenditures and capital leases was not as great as we saw in 2013 to 2014, we did spend over $9 billion on those, on capital expenditures and capital lease obligations, up from prior year was, excuse me…
Operator
Thank you. Our next question…
Brian Olsavsky
Sorry, let me finish my answer to him, please. We grew up – we grew from in the $5 billion range in 2013 to $8.9 billion in 2014 and now over $9 billion in 2015.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Senna with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
Ken Senna
Hi. So lot of headlines around Amazon's activity at Sundance I just was hoping you could maybe expand once more on the video strategy and specifically are you seeing an inflection in Prime Video usage. And maybe just also on your streaming partners program, what the general reception is like? Thank you.
Brian Olsavsky
Sure. We're very thrilled with the customer response to Prime Video. Again, when Prime Video is used by our Prime members, it drives adoption and retention, higher free trial conversion rates, and higher renewal rates for subscribers. So what we were encouraged by in Q4 was that globally we doubled the number of – our Prime members doubled the number of viewing hours of the Prime Video year-over-year. And internationally, we had twice as member Prime members streaming year-over-year. So very encouraged by the pickup and the response of customers.
The other comment I would say about video is we're very happy with the Amazon Studios content, in particular. We've had some great success in 2014 and 2015. As you probably know, Transparent has won multiple Golden Globes and Emmys, both for actors and for the show itself. Mozart in the Jungle just won two Golden Globe Awards.
So very, very pleased with the critical acclaim to the Amazon Studios content and we've got a lot of new content coming out this year. Catastrophe Season 2, Bosch Season 2, we're all looking forward to.
And in February, we will have Chi-Raq, our first original movie that we got to work with Spike Lee on, which won many critical, made many critics' best film list in 2015. That will be coming to Prime Video in February.
Phil Hardin
Just to add, this is Phil. On the question about the streaming partners program, so that's our new over the top streaming subscription program for Prime Members. We think it's a really convenient way for them to access additional content, content sources like Showtime and Starz. And it's really early, so it's just out of the gate. But we've been very pleased with what we've seen so far.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Mark Mahaney
Two things, please. Any callouts on the macro side? Occasionally you called things out, anything this time? And then can you talk a little bit about Amazon business, I know, there is a little bit of a line in the press release on it. I know you've had this for a couple of years. But any indications to materiality of that, the kind of momentum it's gaining, the kind of traction it's gaining? Thank you.
Brian Olsavsky
Sure, Mark. Thanks for your questions. No macroeconomic comments. Again, we feel we're very encouraged by the customer response to our offerings in Q4. Amazon business, yes, in April you may remember we launched it as a marketplace with specific features and benefits for businesses.
That - Amazon business now serves more than 200,000 businesses from small organizations to Fortune 500 companies. So it's still early, but we're encouraged and we think we're creating some value, a lot of value for our business customers.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Mark May
Thanks. Brian, question on international retail business. I think you added well over a billion in revenue year-on-year in the quarter, but from a CSOI perspective, you really didn't see any improvement there. I'm sure there is, there are a lot of different things going on.
I just wondered if you could unpack that a little bit and give us a sense of, you know, what profitability looks like maybe in some of your more mature, established countries and regions, relative to the investments you were making in other countries, so that we can kind of get a better picture of what's actually going on under the hood there? Thanks.
Brian Olsavsky
Sure, Mark. Thanks for your question. We are very pleased by the international growth, 22% FX neutral, was up 1000 basis points year-over-year. We saw that the - we told you the Prime growth, Prime membership growth of 50% in-- excuse me, 51% globally, 47% in the US means that the international Prime programs grew at a faster clip than that.
So very pleased with the up-tick. We rolled out a lot of additional Prime features internationally as well this year, from FREE Same-Day to Prime Now to Prime Music and Prime Video in Japan, to name a few. So very happy with that.
But in general, if I step back, our investments in national are twofold. First, there's the Prime platform and all the features that I just mentioned, including the fulfillment, adding more fulfillment resources to handle higher and higher retail volumes and very strong FBA program as well.
And then the remainder - the biggest other investment area is obviously India. And we like – we continue to see, like what we see in India. In Q4 Amazon India was the top e-commerce site in India throughout the very busy diwali shopping season, including the shopping season, according to comScore. And sales by sellers in Q4 were greater than all of 2014 combined in Q4.
So seeing great progress with downloads, innovations for sellers and customers alike. And we like the ramp there and we're continuing to invest in India.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Douglas Anmuth
Thanks for taking the question. Two things. Just first, on the North America EGM growth, if you could just talk about the 28% there and the decel on an easier comp and whether there's any particular factors within that we should be thinking about and perhaps if there was any weather and apparel impact there?
And then second, last quarter, and I don't want to misquote you, but you said something along the lines of being able to invest as you'd like and also deliver good profit and that the pendulum wouldn't swing as far perhaps as it has in the past. Is that statement and thought still hold as you head into '16? Thanks.
Brian Olsavsky
Sure. Let me start with EGM. So EGM growth, North America EGM growth of 28% was actually also the highest in the last 4 years. So we're happy with that. The deceleration you're seeing of 700 basis points is more a function of the Prime Day that we had in Q3, if you remember. We didn't break it out by segment, but we said that Prime Day contributed 200 basis points to our Q3 run rate, revenue growth rate.
So sequentially last year, any North America EGM we dropped from 31% to 27%. This year, it's 35% to 28%. So there is always a - generally a sequential drop in Q4. But certainly very happy with that business and its role in Prime as well, total customer satisfaction.
Your other question, investments. Yes. We continue to have healthy investments as we've stated across the globe. To step back again on that, our general philosophy is we want to find things - businesses that customers love, that can grow to be large, will provide strong financial returns, and are durable that can last for decades.
We think Prime is that. We think marketplace is that. We think AWS is that. And we are constantly looking for a fourth or fifth business that fits that criteria. So - but as we continue to invest, primarily in.
As I said in Prime, the Prime platform, Prime features for customers, expansion for fulfillment capacity as we build out to support 26% unit growth in Q4, for instance and much greater FBA share, and not to mention all the investments in AWS, we are constantly looking for cost efficiencies and fixing variable productivity.
I think a thing to think about is the investments will ebb and flow over time, but our focus on cost reductions and improvement on customer experience will be constant.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Heath Terry
Great, thanks. I was wondering if you could give us a sense, you know, as we look at the slowing growth in AWS, obviously still from an incredibly high level and still very strong growth there. But take - try and take that into context with the growth in margins that you keep seeing in that business to levels that certainly seem a lot higher than you would anticipate for an Amazon business.
Is there any capacity constraint or management that, that's driving pricing strategy in AWS? We've heard the comments about the number of availability zones that are being launched this year, which is obviously about, a big part of driving incremental capacity in that business and just trying to balance those, think about how we should balance those three things?
Brian Olsavsky
Sure. Let me work backwards from your footprint question or comment. We have - we just announced Korea as a region and we'll be adding five more regions in the next, in the future, in the near future, as we mentioned.
CapEx, let me start with that first. CapEx, we've seen great efficiencies in capital expenditures, particularly in AWS. And we continue to work on better purchase efficiencies and driving utilization rates in our data centers. CapEx, as I mentioned, grew quite a bit in 2014 and grew even more to over $9 billion across all of our capital expenditures and capital leases in 2015.
From the new regions, they are not the major driver in any way. Most of our capacity and capital and capital leases in AWS is to service existing regions and existing customers demand growth. But there is certainly expenditures when we open up new regions. Some of that is not always in the year that we open the region. So we spent a good bit on those new regions already in 2015.
But as far as pricing, there's no capacity constraint, and I would a little bit dispute the deceleration comment on, yes, on a percentage basis, 69% is lower than Q3. But as I said before, we're approaching a $10 billion run rate in this business.
On a dollar basis, we continue to grow – we saw the greatest growth year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter and, again, we continue to invent, now with our price, we continue to innovate on behalf of customers and see great customer response.
Heath Terry
Sure, sure. Got it. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kerry Rice with Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Kerry Rice
Thanks a lot. First question is if you can provide maybe some context around linearity within Q4, more as a, you know, compares to your expectations, obviously you have a ramp up into the holiday season, but was - did December tail off faster than expected or did the ramp up, did it spike higher than you expected?
And then just on the follow-up, maybe can you add some context about how the mobile played a role in the holiday season for Amazon? Thanks.
Phil Hardin
So in terms of - this is Phil. In terms of expectations, I think we were pleased with what we saw this Q4 and, you know, if you look at what we gave for guidance, we were in the upper half of the range there for revenue. So no real callouts there. I think, what was your second part of your question?
Oh, and mobile, we said for a long time continues to be a tailwind for the business. We're working very hard to make sure that it's very easy for customers to buy the things they want to buy and access, a lot of the features they’ve grown accustomed to on the website. And so we're very focused on the convenience factor.
And if you look at some of our new offerings like Prime Now that's available through a mobile app and very convenient for customers. As Brian's mentioned, allowed them to shop even up to Christmas Eve and then have their items delivered in two hours.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.
Carlos Kirjner
Thank you. I have two. I want to go back to AWS margins. You talked briefly about purchasing an asset utilization. But do these explain the 800 bps on a year-on-year margin expansion? And are you seeing anything else? Like, is there any impact of scale driving leverage over fixed costs? Is there some benefit from revenue mix shift, like services like Aurora and Redshift growing faster than EC2 or is all the margin expansion due to purchasing and asset utilization? So that's the first question.
And the second, I have a question about your streaming content expenses or cost of revenues to be more precise. Last year you told us they were $1.3 billion, but if you can give us a figure for '15. In lieu of that, can you comment on whether 4Q saw higher than usual costs for streaming content compared to other quarters in the year? Thank you.
Phil Hardin
Carlos, this is Phil. So your question about the AWS margins, that business as they continued to learn and as we continue to invent and get better at designing and operating the infrastructure and assets, we have been able to drive costs out of that business. So that's one of the primary drivers of the improvements that you see in margin year-over-year.
There's also an FX tailwind in there as well, which I think was about $60 million this quarter, which would contribute on a year-over-year basis, which really arises because we're largely priced in dollars, but have assets with local currency costs throughout the world.
As for the streaming content, we haven't given another update this year and haven't given any commentary on the profile quarter-to-quarter.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Brian Pitz with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Pitz
Thank you. You mentioned Amazon Dash in the press release. Can you give us some color around how you're viewing the traction there both with customers and with brands and devices? And then maybe any update on Twitch. How is traffic and user engagement been trending on that site? Thanks.
Phil Hardin
This is Phil. So on the Dash Buttons, we're really excited about what we're delivering there. I think, as you saw in the release, there are some new devices that take advantage of the underlying service that we think will be really convenient for sellers and interesting for device makers. So we're excited about what we're building there. Don't have any stats for you today.
On the Twitch side, we continue to let Twitch do what Twitch does best. And so don't have any updates on numbers there. But they continue to really engage customers and offer a really unique experience, which was one of the reasons we were attracted to them to start with.
Brian Pitz
And maybe just quickly, end of year fulfillment and sortation centers?
Brian Olsavsky
Yes. I'll take that. So we ended the year at 123 fulfillment centers, up a net 14, and we have 23 sortation centers in the US, up four year-over-year.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your questions.
Gene Munster
Hey, good afternoon. I want to just quickly revisit the margin pendulum question and some of your comments, as you mentioned that to kind of expect it to ebb and flow. Could you tell us if you expect it to ebb and flow, but moving higher or is ebb and flow just mean that, that it's kind of undetermined in 2016?
And then second follow up is the Robotics, any update in terms of number of robots or how you see that expansion going forward? Thank you.
Brian Olsavsky
Yes, my comment on ebb and flow was more about the investment and also including capital expenditures and capital leases, so not around gross margins. And merely I was pointing out that, again, we've laid out all the invested areas where we're seeing heavy investment.
We continue - we see continuation of that certainly into 2016 and beyond. There are quarter-to-quarter and even year-to-year fluctuations in some accounts, and some investment areas.
But generally we're pretty transparent on where we're investing our dollars. And then against that backdrop, we are always looking for efficiency and the nice thing about growing the top line at such a high clip is we have a lot more areas for opportunity to save money year-over-year and we always look to do that.
Phil Hardin
And this is Phil. On the Kiva question, the last update we've given is more than 30,000 robots. We continue to be really pleased with the program and like what it does in the warehouse, both from a density of storage, as well as from making the jobs easier for the associates who are picking packages, by bringing the packages actually to the associates. But no new numbers on that.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
Justin Post
Thank you. Two questions. Was there any category mix impacts in the quarter on gross margins, that's just a quick one? And then secondly, as you look back at last year, you had some quarters where you really exceeded your guidance on the CSOI line.
Maybe looking back or just looking forward, what are the types of things that causes you to come in at the high end versus maybe the low end when you look back or when you look forward? Thank you.
Brian Olsavsky
Sure. First, on guidance, we keep it pretty consistent process on how we look at guidance and how we value or how we estimate the near-term view of the business. I will point out that Q4 is obviously a very large quarter, the largest revenue quarter by far of the year.
There's a lot of demand that comes in the last six weeks of the year as well. So very, very little visibility at the time of guidance when we do recall. So reason our best projections on a lot of fronts. We think it's a similar - we know it's a consistent process and there are times when we under run and sometimes we over run it.
Phil Hardin
On the - this is Phil. On the category mix question, you know, obviously category mix does play a role in the gross margin. I would say, though, that we're much more focused on operating profit dollars and free cash flow dollars, as we've probably talked about before.
The gross margins are impacted by first party versus third party mix, as well as AWS mix if you're looking at the total for the company. So we're much more focused on the dollars. And no specific categories we're calling out as a driver for gross margin because, again, we're much more focused on the profit dollars.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Vogel with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Paul Vogel
Great. Thanks. Just wonder if you could give an update on the strategy around same-day shipping. How we should think about kind of further expansion of that and kind of what parameters do you guys use to determine what markets to go in? Is it density of the market? Is it proximity of your distribution facilities? Just some color on that would be great.
Brian Olsavsky
So we deliver, really quickly, a couple of ways. One is the same-day that you've seen us rollout in number of markets here in the US. There is Prime Now and we're now in more than 25 metropolitan areas for Prime Now. And delivering for free in two hours is difficult and expensive, but customers love it.
So we feel like this is the natural evolution of our delivery and we're happy to invest in that service. You know, we like what it does for Prime members. We like the convenience factor. And so we're taking a long-term approach and doing what we normally do, which is really focus on continuing to drive greater and greater efficiency.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your questions.
Ron Josey
Great. Thanks for taking the questions. So I wanted to ask little more about North American operating margins. Because I think they expanded just under 50 bps this quarter to 4.7%. And that compares to an average of 200 basis points, thereabouts, expansion of the prior three quarters.
So I'm just wondering if in 4Q maybe higher FBAs cost or something else in there that led to maybe an expansion not as great as we saw in prior quarters. And then following up on the Prime Now question, just now, I'm wondering how hour-delivery or two-hour delivery has changed customer perception of just delivery overall? Thank you.
Brian Olsavsky
Sure. Yes, again, I'll point out that the demand for FBA services was very high, nearly 50% of our third party units, again, were FBA. And the demand for space and services was very large by our seller base, which was great from a lot of standpoints, but did exceed our expectations. But did make our warehouses rather full and did cause us to incur some additional variable costs in the US.
And there is also the dynamic that we were fulfilling more of these units ourselves at our warehouses because of the FBA growth and the retail growth.
Phil Hardin
On the speed of delivery, this is Phil, you know, all I can say is the customers love the service. It's very convenient, and it gives them flexibility and the ability to get products really quickly.
I don't know if there is any big trends we are ready to call out at this point, but they seem to really, really like it. So we're encouraged by that. We're excited to invest in it and excited with what we can do for our Prime members.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Doshi with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.
Neil Doshi
Great. Two questions, please. And one, it seems like the Echo did perform well. Can you talk more broadly about your Internet of Things ambitions and kind of how Echo plays into that strategy?
And then secondly, just wanted to know a little bit more about restaurant delivery. It seems a little bit outside of the wheelhouse. What's the impetus behind doing more in terms of food delivery and what are your ambitions there? Thanks.
Brian Olsavsky
So on the Echo, we like what - how Echo has done. We're really excited about the ecosystem and some of the skills that are being added to Echo, as well as some of the other devices that are taking advantage of Alexa, which is kind of the brains behind Echo.
So we like our device business in general. As you probably saw from the press release, we had a good Q4, where we did almost doubled, or double what we did last year. So very excited about the devices. We like that they pump more energy into Prime and really the whole ecosystem.
Not sure on the Internet of Things, but it's very exciting for devices standpoint. And the brains of Echo are in the AWS cloud. And so, Echo gets new capabilities all the time as Alexa gets better and better.
On the restaurant delivery, it's just another great service we can offer for our Prime members. This is tied in with the Prime Now offering in a handful of cities at this point. And so we have the delivery people going out and making the deliveries in the neighborhoods. And so this is one more really valuable convenient service we can offer for our Prime customers.
Operator
Thank you. Our final question will come from John Blackledge with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.
John Blackledge
Great, thanks. Two questions. First one, shipping costs were higher than we expected. I think it was 12.5% of net revenue versus 11% last year. Just any color on the higher shipping costs? And is that percentage of net revenue a new normal as we are in 2016 now and as we look out?
And then the second question on Prime Now, in 25 markets globally, how should we think about the total number of markets that - additional markets you can enter with the Prime Now offering in 2016? Thanks.
Brian Olsavsky
Sure. As you say, net shipping margin was up 70 basis points year-over-year. Again, this is all tied in with the increase in FBA growth and the demand from Prime members. We're shipping more units – more of our units, so this ripples through our ship cost per unit, and again, the calculation of ship costs as margin is a percent of revenue and that is impacted by the denominator effect on the FBA sales, being booked at a net revenue.
Phil Hardin
Related to your Prime Now question, this is Phil, we're in more than 25 metropolitan locations. It's - if you've been watching, this rollout's really happened in the last year. So it's been a pretty rapid rollout.
And we're excited to bring it to more places. We don't have a target for you today, but we are working hard to bring it to more and more places. We're outside the US now in a handful of countries in the UK and Japan, and Italy and working to expand. So it's a program we're really excited about and we're happy to bring it to more customers.
Phil Hardin
Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q3 2015 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please go ahead.
Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations
Hello and welcome to our Q3 2015 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's view as of today, October 22, 2015 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.
During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2014.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Brian.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our third quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 72% to $9.8 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $5.4 billion, up from $1.1 billion. Trailing 12 months free cash flow, less lease principal repayments was $3.1 billion, up from an outflow of $99 million. Trailing 12 months free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and capital acquired under capital leases was $637 million, up from an outflow of $2.3 billion.
Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.4 billion. Capital expenditures does not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. These capital expenditures and capital leases reflect additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 489 million shares compared with 481 million one year ago. Worldwide revenue grew 23% to $25.4 billion, or 30% excluding the $1.3 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange.
Worldwide paid unit growth was 26%. Worldwide active customer accounts was approximately 294 million. Excluding customers who only had free orders in the preceding 12-month period, worldwide active customers were approximately 272 million, up from approximately 244 million in the comparable prior-year period. Worldwide seller units represented 46% of paid units, up from 42% in the comparable prior-year period.
Now, I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $16.8 billion or 66.1% of revenue, compared with 71.1%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content, and G&A combined was $7.6 billion, or 30.1% of sales, up approximately 50 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $3.1 billion or 12.3% of revenue, compared with 12.4%. Tech and content was $2.9 billion or 11.4% of revenue, compared with 10.8%. Marketing was $1.2 billion or 4.8% of revenue, compared with 4.7%.
Now, I'll talk about our segment results. As a reminder, in the first quarter, we changed our reportable segments to report North America, International and Amazon Web Services. Consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or the other operating expense line item.
In the North America segment, revenue grew 28% to $15 billion, or 29% excluding foreign exchange. Media revenue grew 8% to $3 billion, or 9% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 35% to $11.8 billion. EGM now represents 79% of North America revenues. North America segment operating income was $528 million, a 3.5% operating margin, compared to a loss of $60 million in the prior-year period. North America segment operating income includes $11 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.
In the International segment, revenue increased 7% to $8.3 billion. Excluding the $1.3 billion year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 24%. Media revenue decreased 8% to $2.3 billion, or increased 6% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 14% to $5.9 billion, or 32% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 71% of International revenues. International segment operating loss was $56 million compared to a loss of $174 million in the prior-year period. International segment operating loss includes $64 million of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.
In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 78% to $2.1 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income was $521 million, a 25% operating margin, compared to $98 million in the prior-year period. AWS segment operating income includes $78 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.
Consolidated segment operating income was $993 million or 3.9% of revenue, up approximately 460 basis points year-over-year. CSOI includes $25 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income was $406 million, compared to a loss of $544 million in the prior-year period.
Our income tax expense was $161 million. GAAP net income was $79 million or $0.17 per diluted share compared to the net loss of $437 million or a loss of $0.95 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $7.5 billion year-over-year to $14.4 billion. Inventory increased 23% to $9 billion, and inventory turns were 8.6, down from 8.9 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 22% to $14.4 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 79 from 74 in the prior year.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable, and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as a global economy and customer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we've described in more detail on our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have material effects on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q4 2015, we expect net sales of between $33.5 billion and $36.75 billion, or growth of between 14% and 25%. This guidance anticipates approximately 340 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, GAAP operating income to be between $80 million and $1.28 billion compared to $591 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. This includes approximately $620 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $700 million and $1.9 billion compared to $1.04 billion in the fourth quarter 2014.
We remain heads down, focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions.
Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations
Great. Thanks, Brian. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Certainly. At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. Our first question comes from Scott Devitt with Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed. Your line is live.
Scott W. Devitt - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. The first question, Brian, International retail growth continues to improve, and I was wondering if you can just talk through some of the dynamics there, understanding that consumption tax in Japan comped, you have some newer markets where you have physical infrastructure now in Europe, and then also the dynamics in India and China as contributors.
And then secondly, maybe if you could just, given how profitable AWS has become, if you could give a framework for thinking about the long-term profitability of that business. Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure, Scott. Thanks for your questions. On the International, yes, you're right. First of all, the FX neutral growth of 24% year-over-year was up 200 basis points versus Q2 and up 1,100 basis points year-over-year. Some of that is due to the comping of the JP consumption tax increase in April of last year, which we said last year impacted Q2 and Q3 and not really impacted Q4. So we're seeing the last of that on the comp. And the impact of Prime Day globally we estimated at about 200 basis points, and we saw a pickup in both. I'll remind you that Prime Day was a global event, so we saw that is International as well, and it was a great event for – a great day for customers, Amazon and sellers alike.
But the base International growth is really being driven by Prime adoption, greater selection, greater Prime selection, including FBA. So it's essentially the same playbook at the U.S., the additional Prime features. We launched a Prime Now location in the UK this quarter. Not materially going to impact the entire continent, but it's a good start. So we like the trends in International, and they mirror many of the same things we see in North America.
On AWS, I don't remember your question, business model there. Yeah, let me talk about margin. It was up sequentially from Q2, from 21.4% to 25%. We're continuing to see great acceleration in the pace of innovation. We've launched 530 new significant features this year, which is more than last year already. We continue to lower prices. We've lowered prices eight times since a rather large price cut in April of 2014, excuse me, April of 2014. And we like that the customers are really responding. They like the speed and agility that AWS provides them. They like the new features that we launched, many of which are also enable them to lower their cost of infrastructure. Amazon Aurora, one-tenth the price of other high-end commercial databases, a new storage class of Amazon S3, QuickSight, also very effective and cost-effective products for our customers.
So like AWS, the model remains early days and we enjoy leading this business and customers responded well and we believe we are adding new services and features at a rate faster than many others. But the growth rates and margins will certainly remain lumpy and bumpy as we go forward. But we're very encouraged by the business, and so are our customers.

Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Please proceed. Your line is live.
Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Hello? Can you hear me?
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes.
Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Okay. Thanks. A question hopefully hasn't been asked already is around AWS. Margins were obviously quite strong in the quarter. Can you speak to the sustainability of the margin improvement that we've seen there, and what is your long-term expectations for profit margins for this business? And if you could give us a sense of what CapEx for this segment of the business looked like in the quarter, and the rate of growth there would be helpful.
And then secondly, your employee adds were fairly strong in the quarter as well. I wonder if you could call out any particular areas of – within the business where you're strengthening your hiring efforts. Thanks.
Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations
So this is Phil. I'll take the AWS portion. So I'll echo what Brian said earlier. This is a young and rapidly growing business, and as you've seen looking backwards, certainly growth rates and margins and capital expenditure timing can be bumpy. We're taking a very long-term view on this business. We're excited about the potential there, and really the team's focused on just keeping their heads down and continuing to accelerate the pace of innovation to try to continue to grow the functionality gap we think we offer. So a lot of hard work going on there. But again, we're taking a long-term view on the business and interested in helping customers as much as possible in that space.
On the CapEx, again, we're focused on the ability to drive efficiencies across all of Amazon, but we're also certainly investing in growth. And so, on the AWS side, we've got investment going on around the world, certainly additional servers to support the strong growth we have. And some of the expense for things like data centers or new regions can be a little lumpy, and we've mentioned a couple of new regions we're working on throughout the world. So that's going on as well.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Mark, on your head count question, you're right. Headcount was up 49% year-over-year, which is higher than Q2 – we saw in Q2. This is going to be primarily in our ops area. If you exclude ops-related employees, our head count's growing actually slower than our FX neutral growth rate of 30%. So, what's going on in ops is we've added 14 net fulfillment centers this year, bringing the total to 123 globally. We've added four sort centers in the U.S., bringing U.S. footprint to 23. We're staffing earlier in those locations, we're in good shape for the holidays and ready to go.
The other issue is there, the other reason is that we are also doing a lot of conversion of temp workers to full-time workers purposefully. There is a metric employment of full-time hires. So it is a little bit higher due to that program.

Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
I'm tempted to ask about the long-term margins for AWS, but I won't. Could you talk about two areas? One, EGM growth in North America. It's accelerated really strongly. Any color behind what's – any particular categories that are driving that? And secondly, you've made some public comments in the last eight months about some, on the retail side, about investments internationally, particularly in India. Could you just refresh us on what kind of levels of spend you're interested in targeting in that market, and then maybe as part of that, any comments on China and how well you think you're doing there now. Thanks a lot.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure. On EGM growth, I won't call out any particular categories, but it is a direct reflection of our efforts to grow selection, both our retail selection and also our third party, particularly FBA which is also Prime eligible and then just the responsiveness of our customers, especially our Prime customers to the EGM product line. So, we're very encouraged with EGM growth.
And on India, I will not – excuse me – I won't give specific dollar numbers around investment, but I can give you an update on India. We're really encouraged with what we are seeing, both on the customer side and the seller side. On the customer side – excuse me, active customer accounts are up 230% year-over-year. We are in the middle of the Diwali season that is going really well. Sales are 4x what they were last year. So customers are responding greatly this year. We continue to invest. We've been adding products at a rate of 40,000 products per day so far this year. And just as big as the number of sellers, the sellers, the number of sellers has grown more than 250% year-over-year, 90% of those sellers are using our logistics and warehouse services. And as a result, we've tripled our fulfillment capacity year-over-year. So we are very encouraged, as I said last quarter in India, and continue to invest there very heavily.
Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations
Mark, I think you asked about China as well, this is Phil. So we're continuing to work on some of the items we've been talking about for a couple of quarters now. So the team had some interesting ideas, really focused on making Amazon a trusted conduit for Chinese customers to access, authentic international branded products, and things that customers can't get. I think Amazon Global Store continues to expand the selection there. We added about another 400,000 items to that store this quarter and continue to focus on using our global network of vendors to be able to get those products to customers. We continue to test store on Tmall as well. The team has some other ideas, but that's what we're talking about so far.

Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS Investment Research.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question. Can you call out in terms of the 3P business what you're seeing in terms of third party sellers maybe needing to make more and more of their goods Prime eligible? What the economics of that might be in terms of creating a tailwind for the business, and how we should think about that evolving over the next couple of years. Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure, Eric. What I can tell you is the 3P percent of revenue continues to grow, we are now up to 46% of paid units, which is up 400 basis points year-over-year, and 100 basis points sequentially of Q2. We feel that Prime and FBA are – reinforce each other. They're inextricably linked. FBA as Prime selection and Prime growth attracts more FBA sellers. So, we have seen growth in FBA, it increases our Prime fast track eligible selection which we like and customers like. So, we like what we see on the third party side.
Operator
Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.
Thank you. We did see the acceleration in EGM. Just wondering if some of the local delivery and Prime Now is driving that acceleration. Is that having a big impact on your business? And down the road, do you think the delivery infrastructure will be valuable in maybe delivering third party and other units? Thank you.
Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations
This is Phil. So it's still pretty early for a lot of the really expedited delivery options. We've been working on our network for about 20 years to be able to enable some of the really fast delivery with things like Prime Now. But at this point, we're in a relatively small list of cities, but it's expanding pretty fast. I think we launched a couple more Prime Now cities just today, so that brings us up to about 17 across the globe. On the next day or same day, here in the U.S., we continue to expand that as well, but we think that those fast options add us to the consideration set of a customer's purchase on some purchases that we might not otherwise be included in. But at this point, we're still working on that and kind of getting it up to speed. So nothing specific to call out on that.
On the other part of your question, we continue to work on the network around the world, but I can't respond to any of the rumors and speculation.

Our next question comes from Robert Peck with SunTrust.
Kunal Madhukar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Hi. Thanks for letting me ask a question. This is Kunal for Bob. Quick question on India. Is there any change or any indication that there might be a change in the regulatory framework that would allow you to go direct?
Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations
This is Phil. I don't know that we have anything to comment on on that.
Kunal Madhukar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.

Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask the most frequent investor question and concern that we get is when will Amazon flip back to its heavier spending and investment ways from 2014 and earlier? So I just wanted to ask, is that a legitimate question do you think or are you now at a point of scale and market share and maturity that you can sustainably manage the heavy investment while still delivering material profit? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, thanks, Doug. Well, I will point out that this quarter showed a lot of innovation, a lot of new products and features and a lot of investment. We've already talked about India but domestically we are, globally, we are investing very heavily in our Prime platform, both in North America and International and that includes video content and original content, Prime Music. Phil just said the Prime Now has been expanded to 14 metro areas. We've had same-day delivery now in 16 metro areas. We've built 14 new fulfillment centers. We've launched multiple devices including e-readers, tablets that are priced under $50, Echo, Dash Button.
So there is a lot of investment going on and there will be continued, especially related to Prime. And on the AWS side, as I said, we have 530 new features so far this year. So innovation and investment will continue and can be lumpy. I hate to use that word again, but could be lumpy over time. The other dynamic in our company though is definitely working on cost reductions and efficiency. And I think you see a lot of that in this quarter's P&L and in our capital efficiency, both in the warehouse world and also in infrastructure. So we will continue to work on costs. The good thing about 30% revenue growth is it gives you a lot more cost to work on as well.
So I would say it's not as much of pendulum as maybe it's been portrayed. It's more of a constant. The investment will, it sometimes ebbs and flows, but the cost reductions will be a constant presence and the increase in customer experience and shortening the time to delivery and making the customer experience better.

Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my questions. You guys have had the Kindle Store in Brazil since December of 2012. Just curious about the learnings around that and kind of what benchmarks are you analyzing as you kind of try to determine whether or not to invest further in a larger Brazil store?
And then the second one, just curious for comments on International Prime sub growth. It sounds like Prime subs are growing really well. I think a couple of quarters ago, you mentioned how they're growing over 50%. Is that still the case? And if so, what's driving that faster International Prime sub-growth?
Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations
So, on the Brazil side – this is Phil – we've had the Kindle Store in Brazil for a while. I think we look at all of our investments with an eye towards trying to maximize long-term free cash flow at strong returns on invested capital. So that's across the board. That's kind of the criteria we're using, making sure we're building things that customers love that can have attractive financial returns over time, and can persist for a long time. And if they work, can be big. And so, that's the metrics we're using. There's nothing specific to call out to Brazil though.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
And this is Brian. We're not going to update our Prime subscription growth beyond what we said last year at the end of last year, which last year in a year when we raised prices early in 2014. The global growth rate was 53% and North America growth rate was 50%. So, by default, the International growth rate was higher.
We like the adoption of Prime internationally. It's helped by additional selection that's available for fast track shipment, including FBA. So that flywheel is working. We've also launched video benefits most recently in Japan, but we have them in the U.K. and Germany. We continue to launch other Prime benefits, Amazon Pantry in Japan and Germany this quarter. We launch Prime Now in the U.K. So, it's very similar to the U.S. story, potentially time lagged a bit, but we are seeing the same customer adoption and impact on growth rates.
Operator
Our next call, caller, it's from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein. Please proceed.
Carlos Kirjner-Neto - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Thank you. I have two questions. So you have told us that you have tens of millions of Prime users that you are investing heavily in Prime. Now, at this scale I know with the 50% plus growth rates that you just mentioned, if you roll the clock two or three years, one can see Prime penetration in markets like the U.S. starting to saturate as there are just so many homes in the country. How should we think about the level of investment in Prime once you have reached full penetration? Are there components that are due primarily to customer acquisition, and what's the right way to think about that?
And secondly, what are the economic drivers that justify the business case for Prime Now? I don't expect you to give us any numbers, I've learned that in the last few years. But what are the components of the customer lifecycle value calculation or whatever calculation that you make to justify someone dropping a box with a, I don't know, $15 order to a customer? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure. Thank you, Carlos. First on, classify as Prime demographics. So yes, we still think there's a lot of people in the country who are not Prime members. And we're anxious to have them try it and sign up and join. The other thing that we see is that with our vast offering of selection and faster and faster shipping programs, we have more competitive offering for many things that they buy. So there's a share of wallet element to it as well over time that we are looking to be more useful to customers all the time.
On your comment about the economic drivers of Prime Now, what I'll say is customers really value it. It's not our entire selection, it's tens of thousands of items that they may need on a daily basis. We think it's an interesting part of the selection offer for Prime and it's, in many ways, something that we can do that others can't, because it's a natural evolution of our 20-year effort to grow our fulfillment center network and our scale quite frankly makes it possible to even offer this to customers.

Our next question comes from Neil Doshi with Mizuho Securities.
Neil A. Doshi - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.
Great. Thanks, guys. Can you talk a little bit more about India and what's kind of the opportunity there that you see, there's a tremendous amount of – tremendous middle class there. But the distribution can be very challenging. So is that an area where we could see Amazon really building out the last mile? And then there's been some reports of an Amazon potentially trying to close the gap in terms of delivery and deliver sooner. On the grocery side, what's the impetus there? And can we see how the recent markets have been trending on the grocery side that you've launched recently? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I'll take the India question. So again, India is a different market and does not have a lot of the same ready fulfillment options that some other countries did. We see that as an opportunity, an opportunity that we can build and we can bring to sellers. And as I believe I already mentioned, we like what we see. We're very encouraged. Customer accounts, active customer accounts are up 230% year-over-year and sellers – number of sellers is up 250% year-over-year. 90% of those sellers use our logistics and warehouse services, as you mentioned, which has caused us to triple our fulfillment capacity. And we're happy to do so. We like what we see in India. We think we have – we're attractive both to customers and to sellers and we like our position.
Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations
This is Phil. So, on the grocery side, for fresh we're in a handful of metropolitan areas here in the U.S. It's been a relatively measured rollout by Amazon standards. We continue to work on the customer experience and making sure we're really delivering a quality experience for shoppers. And we're also working on the economics. And so we continue to work on that, but not much new to add right now.

Our next question is from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.
Heath Patrick Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Thanks. I was wondering if you could give us a sense how some of the recent announcements from FedEx and UPS about pricing during the holidays and the structure of some of the third party relationships might impact you? And given the investments that you've made in your own fulfillment infrastructure, how much of a competitive advantage you feel like you've got during the holiday season as other retailers that are more directly exposed to these changes have to deal with it.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
No comment on the pricing. I would say that we have 23 sort centers, which allows us to control a lot more of our shipments for longer. But we certainly value our relationships with USPS, FedEx, UPS and other global carriers. So – and we're looking forward to a great holiday season.

Our next question comes from Aaron Kessler with Raymond James.
Aaron M. Kessler - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Yes. Hi, guys. Just quickly on, if you can talk about some of the more experimental projects you work on. I guess the travel business you're kind of in again for a few months and got out of, also maybe just with restaurants, providing restaurant delivery. How do you view these services? They're not necessarily core to what you do. Obviously, you can provide those services, but how should we think about these types of investments longer term? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
So on destinations, we're constantly trying new things and testing and measuring and iterating here at Amazon. We learned a lot, but we've discontinued that. On the restaurant delivery, we've had it for a couple months here in Seattle and recently announced it in Portland. It fits very well with Prime Now. So at this point, it's pretty small, but something we're excited to do for customers. We think it will be helpful for them, and we're happy to take advantage of some of the competencies we've built with Prime Now and with our fulfillment network so far.

Our next question comes from Brian Pitz with Jefferies & Company.
Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Some questions on video. Any color such as engagement on the recent launch of video products in Japan, including the Fire TV, the Fire TV Stick, and Prime Video? And also, any general updates on your video content strategy or view on standalone streaming separate from Prime. Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, I'll take that one. This is Brian. So no specific callouts in Japan. I would say that we are still very bullish on our Prime Instant Video, especially our new original content we've created. We think it's being critically acclaimed and also a big hit with customers. Man in the High Castle is coming out shortly, as is the second season of Transparent which won Emmys this year. So we're really excited about the creative team we've assembled and the products that they've been able to bring to Prime customers. And we still like the customer reaction. Free trial conversion rates are higher when Prime members stream, and they also renew at a higher rate their annual subscriptions. So, again, that's very important to us as well and we're very happy with the results.
Operator
Our next question is from Ben Schachter with Macquarie Equities Research.
Ben Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
Hey, guys. So Prime has done remarkably well with folks willing to pay $99 up front. But do you expect to have different offerings for different cohorts? In other words, right now, Prime is sort of a one-size-fits-all model. Could we see different pricing models for different demographics in the future? And then separately, can you also talk about how shipping leverage changes during the holiday season when shoppers tend to order more items per transaction? Thanks.
Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations
Sure. So this is Phil. On the Prime pricing, we do have a few different programs for different demographics today with programs like Prime Student or Prime Family, which we're very excited about. Can't speculate as to what we'd do in the future, but Prime is a program that's really important for us, and we're working hard every day to continue to build selection there and to continue to make Prime better. And so hopefully, you see that in the list of things we've launched recently and the continued cadence of making the services we have better. We just added a lot of new music in our Prime Music program. And as Brian mentioned, some of the upcoming programming should be pretty good in the fall. The Man in the High Castle was actually our most-watched pilot, so we're excited about that one as well. So continuing to work on Prime.
On the shipping side, I would say it's a difficult equation. Yes, order size can go up, but we ship a lot of toys and bigger items. So it's hard to predict what that looks like. But having the density, having the sort centers has certainly helped our cost structure in that area and having inventory closer to our customers.
Operator
Our next question is from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.
Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Okay. Thanks. So Brian, it seems like you guys are rolling out Prime Now as well as product verticals internationally fairly quickly, especially if you measure it versus the pace of rollout for Fresh or your other international older territories. So am I reading too much into this, or have guys put in place different processes to iterate more quickly?
And second, I think you've disclosed that as of the end of 2014, a little less than 10% of your fulfillment centers are outfitted with Kiva. So I guess are all of your other fulfillment centers on a go-forward basis going to have Kiva? If not, why not? And given the pickup and presumably the volume throughput there, does this mean you can slow down the pacing of your build-out there? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, sure. On Prime Now, it is our intent to roll out benefits and functionality globally as quickly as possible. I think we're able to do that with Prime Now and get to the UK faster. We're happy with that. It's not necessarily common on AmazonFresh. They're just, they're different businesses. So we're happy with the launch in the UK and the team did a great job to get that launch in a timely manner. On Kiva, we are up to 30,000 bots at the end of Q3, and they're in 13 fulfillment centers. At the end of 2014, we had 15,000 bots, so we've doubled that amount and they were in 10 warehouses. So our intent is to use that more widely and stay tuned.

Our next question comes from Ron Josey with JMP Securities.
Ron Victor Josey - JMP Securities LLC
Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just real quickly on paid unit growth, accelerated 26% this year. I realize it's easier comps, but anything significantly higher or anything that happened this quarter? I know Prime Day could be it, but wondering if that was the reason. And then on AWS usage, just wondering if you can give an update on usage. I believe last quarter you mentioned usage was growing faster than revenue. I wonder if that's the same case this quarter. Thank you.
Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations
So this is Phil. On the unit side, you did see units move at a rate that's highly correlated with revenue there. Keep in mind, AWS and some of the other rental-type offerings don't generate units, so we don't count those. But we did see, certainly saw some additional units as a result of Prime Day. And on a longer-term bigger basis, the continued growth of Prime, the continued selection expansion, is helping with the unit's growth there. Sorry, was there a second part of your question?
Ron Victor Josey - JMP Securities LLC
It was just on AWS unit growth. I think last quarter, you said it was growing faster than revenue. I'm wondering if that's still the case here.
Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations
We continue to see really, yeah, sorry. We continue to see really strong usage growth across the board, and it's coming from customers of all sizes. We also have recently announced that Aurora, which is our new database software, is our fastest-growing service ever. So for a long time, we talked about Redshift, and Aurora has now outpaced that. So we're very excited about what we're seeing there.

Our next question comes from Youssef Squali with Cantor Fitzgerald.
Youssef H. Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities
Thank you very much. Two quick questions. First, with the courts striking down the Safe Harbor provision between the U.S. and the EU, how do you see the changes to European data storage requirement affecting AWS potentially? And on the Kiva, a question asked earlier, can you just maybe help us understand the capital intensity of an FC using Kiva versus one that's not? Thank you.
Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations
So, this is Phil. I'll take the Safe Harbor question with AWS. With our EU-approved AWS data protection agreement and model clauses we have in place, AWS customers can keep running their global operations using AWS and be in compliance with the e-law. I think your second question was about the capital intensity of Kiva.
Youssef H. Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities
Yeah, Kiva, yeah right.
Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations
Yeah, I'm going to be vague on the scale of it, but their capital intensity is offset by their density and throughput. So it's a bit of an investment that has implications for a lot of elements to your cost structure, but we're very happy with Kiva. We think it's a great, pairing our associates with Kiva robots to do some of the hauling of products within the warehouse has been a great innovation for us. We think it makes the warehouse jobs better and I think it makes our warehouses more productive.
Operator
Thank you. Our last question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen & Company.
John Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC
Hi, great. Thanks. Two questions. So first, our data suggest that a U.S. Prime sub growth is growing very rapidly at scale. Just wondering where you think the U.S. Prime sub base is right now on the adoption curve.
And then the second question is North America and EGM growth accelerating again this quarter. We're assuming growth is being driven in part by categories like apparel and consumables versus perhaps some more mature category like electronics. So the questions are, with a vertical mix changing, how should we think about the impact of margins or some of the newer and faster growing categories, structurally higher margins for Amazon than the more mature categories? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, I would say – can't get into too much detail on the components of EGM profitability. I would say that we're seeing strong growth across all of our EGM categories. And we have great teams that are chasing a lot of different product lines and working with vendors to get more selection on site, both retail and also third party. So still a lot of room there. On the Prime sub growth, we're not updating the statistics. We are very happy with the growth, not only in participation, but also purchases and retention and we had a very successful Prime Day in July that we're really happy. It was a great event for customers and sellers. That's all I have on that.
Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations
All right. Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.",https://seekingalpha.com/article/3596936-amazon-com-amzn-q3-2015-results-earnings-call-transcript

Greetings, thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q2 2015 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.
For opening remarks I will be turning the call over to Director of Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please go ahead.
Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations
Hello. And welcome to our Q2 2015 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO who will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 23, 2015 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K.
As you listen to today's conference call we encourage you to have our press release in front of you which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2014.
Now I'll turn the call over to Brian.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Phil. I will begin comments on our second-quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 69% to $8.98 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $4.37 billion up from $1.04 billion. In the supplemental financial information and business metrics portion of our earnings release, we include a few additional free cash flow measures. We believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through capital and finance releases.
Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.61 billion. Capital expenditures do not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. The increase in capital expenditures and capital leases reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
Return on invested capital was 17% up from 6%. ROIC is trailing 12 month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter-ends. Combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 488 million shares compared with 480 million one year ago. Worldwide revenue grew 20% to $23.18 billion, or 27% excluding the $1.39 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign-exchange.
Worldwide paid unit growth was 22%. Worldwide active customer accounts was approximately 285 million. Excluding customers who only had three orders in the preceding 12 month period worldwide active customers were approximately 265 million up from approximately 237 million in the comparable prior year period. Worldwide seller units represented 45% of paid units, up from 41% in the comparable prior year period.
Now I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $15.16 billion or 65.4% of revenue compared with 69.3%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $6.95 billion or 29.9% of sales, up approximately 130 basis points year-over-year.
Fulfillment was $2.74 billion or 11.8% of revenue compared with 11.8%. Tech and content was $2.70 billion or 11.7% of revenue compared with 10.4%. Marketing was $1.1 billion or 4.7% of revenue compared with 4.7%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results. As a reminder, in the first quarter we changed our reportable segments to report North America, International, and Amazon Web Services. Consistent with prior periods we do not allocate two segments, our stock-based compensation, or the other operating expense line item.
In the North America segment, revenue grew 26% to $13.8 billion. Media revenue grew 6% to $2.62 billion or 7% excluding foreign-exchange. EGM revenue grew 31% to $10.99 billion or 32% excluding foreign-exchange. EGM now represents 80% of North America revenues. North America segment operating income increased 113% to $703 million a 5.1% operating margin. Excluding the $9 million favorable impact from foreign-exchange, North America segment operating income increased 111%.
In the International segment revenue increased 3% to $7.56 billion. Excluding the $1.37 billion year-over-year unfavorable impact from foreign-exchange, revenue growth was 22%. Media revenue decreased 12% to $2.09 billion or increased 3% excluding foreign-exchange. EGM revenue grew 10% to $5.43 billion or 31% excluding foreign-exchange. EGM now represents 72% of International revenues. International segment operating loss was $19 million compared to a loss of $2 million in the prior year period. International segment operating loss includes $89 million of unfavorable impact from foreign-exchange.
In the Amazon Web Services segment revenue increased 81% to $1.82 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income increased 407% to $391 million, a 21.4% operating margin. Excluding the $71 million favorable impact from foreign-exchange, AWS segment operating income increased 314%. Consolidated segment operating income increased 166% to $1.07 billion or 4.6% of revenue, up approximately 250 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $9 million unfavorable impact from foreign-exchange, CSOI increased 168%.
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income include stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP Operating income was $464 million compared to a loss of $15 million in the prior year period. Our income tax expense was $266 million. GAAP net income was $92 million or $0.19 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $126 million or a loss of $0.27 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $6.02 billion year-over-year to $14 billion. Inventory increased 12% to $7.47 billion and inventory turns were 8.9 turns down from 9.1 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories.
Accounts payable increased 18% to $12.39 billion and accounts payable days increased to 74 from 71 in the prior year. I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and customer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we describe in more detail in our public filings issues such as settling inter-company balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to effective tax rate can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't include additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and if foreign-exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q3 2015 we expect net sales of between $23.3 billion and $25.5 billion, or growth of between 13% and 24%. This guidance anticipates approximately 620 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign-exchange rates, GAAP operating income or loss to be between $480 million loss and $70 million of income compared to a $544 million loss in the third quarter of 2014.
This includes approximately $580 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $100 million and $650 million, compared to a $136 million loss in the third quarter of 2014. We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection, and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions.
Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations
Great. Thanks, Brian. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Certainly. Our first question comes from Mark May with Citi. Please proceed. Your line is live.
Mark May - Citi Investment Research
Thanks for taking my questions. You clearly had a lot of things working well in the quarter, but maybe just focusing in on AWS, which seems to be quickly emerging as kid of your largest contributor to operating income. Can you maybe provide a little more color on what drove the acceleration and just the overall growth in the business? If you could talk a little bit about the addition of new customers versus average spend per customer and I think in the past you've talked about what unit growth was for AWS? And in the press release you talked about expanding AWS into some new International markets. Can you give us a feel for how much of AWS' business today is domestic and what kind of opportunity you have there to expand AWS outside the U.S.?
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes, Mark. Thanks for your question. We will not be providing the granular customer detail unfortunately but we will say the growth of 81% was up 49% in Q1. You remember that we are lapping a number of large price decreases in Q2 of last year, so it was somewhat expected but a very strong quarter in AWS.
We did announce a region in India. The other thing to mention is that we continue to see very strong usage of growth that's outpacing the revenue growth of 81% obviously. And so, we're really excited about it. From a distribution of customers, it is a global business. We have regions spread throughout the world; we have 11 regions at this point and have announced plans to launch a region in India in the future.
Operator
Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed; your line is live.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Great. Thank you for taking the question. There has been some recent press reports talking about investments in India. I wanted to know – you've talked a little bit about that market in the past – whether there was any update there in terms of how you think about approaching the market and the level of investments that might be needed to compete in the market? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Certainly Eric. What I can say about India is when we see a positive surprise we double down on it. That's kind of our policy, and India is that kind of surprise. So we're very happy, very encouraged early on with what we've seen in the ramping of the business, the level of invention going on for both customers and sellers. We are over $25 million or excuse me, 25 million names (14:02) which is the largest online store in India. And we continue to improve pricing and fast delivery so were super excited about India. I will not get into specific investment levels right now but we continue to ramp up our investment there.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks so much.
Operator
Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.
Thank you. A couple of questions here. We followed this coming for a long time and profits seem to move around quite a bit year-over-year and year against year. And just wondering how you think about that? Is that just the nature of your big bets and that's just going to continue or is there a way to kind of smooth that out?
And then secondly, in AWS it does seem like pricing competition has come down and we've been to a lot of your events and it seems like you're emphasizing pricing a little less to your customers. Can you talk at all about the pricing environment in cloud? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure, let me start with that second question. So, as Phil mentioned, we are seeing continued increases in usage, both sequentially and year-over-year. We are also seeing a great efficiency in the business on a cost basis. Innovation is accelerating, not decelerating. We had over 350 significant new features and services and we believe that's what resonates with customers. While pricing is certainly a factor we don't believe it's always the primary factor; in fact what we hear from our customers is that the ability to move faster and more agiley is what they value. I'm sorry the first party your question was?
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.
I was asking about just how the profitability kind of really moves pretty big swings year-over-year? Is that the nature of your just big bets and that can continue or is there a way to kind of smooth that out going forward? How do you think about that?
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes sure. Well here's how I think about it. We have two things, at least two things going on. We are continuing to drive operational improvement in every business that we are in, but we are also investing in large opportunities that are in front of us, particularly in Marketplace Prime and AWS. If you saw our shareholder letter this year, I think Jeff Bezos put it really well. He said we're going to look for things that are important to customers, customers love them, businesses that can grow to be a large size that can generate a high return on invested capital and are durable and can last for decades. So we will continue to invest in the businesses we think fit that profile and we're always looking for a fourth or fifth business that fits that profile. So as far as lumpiness, admittedly it is lumpy and we will continue to work on both those tracks going forward.
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.
Thank you.
Operator
And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Thanks. I don't know if Tom's listening in. That's a great exit on his part. On International retail you guys had nice acceleration there. Could you give us a little more of the why behind that? Why would International revenue grow, particularly in EGM, accelerate pretty materially. And is that the impact – it's one thesis – is that the impact of kind of the buildup of Prime in International markets and also in the U.S. too, but more spend per Prime customers as they go through this evolution that is just kind of layering on? Is that what it is? What is causing that acceleration? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Certainly. We saw good acceleration in both North America and International this quarter. North America was up 200 basis points sequentially and International was up 800 basis points and half of that you remember we've spoken about the impact of the Japanese consumption tax that was instituted last – April 1 of 2014. It had a measurable impact on our run rate, our growth rate last year particularly Q2. And so we are lapping that, which sequentially makes up half of the 800 basis points sequential gain.
But independent of that, yes, you're right; Prime membership continues to grow. Faster outside, data that we gave at the end of the year. It's growing faster outside the U.S. than it is in the U.S. and we are happy with both growth rates quite frankly. So I would say the Prime membership to Prime flywheel, the additional benefits we are adding to Prime, not only in North America but also Internationally, and additional selection both retail and FBA which feeds the Prime flywheel.
Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay thanks a lot.
Operator
Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one on the North America retail profitability was up nicely. Can you just talk to some of the drivers of that? Is it more top-line and more Prime subs coming on or is it more on the logistics side and what's driving the North America improving profitability? And then on the International profitability, is there any way you can help us understand the profitability of the more mature International markets like U.K. and Germany relative to the U.S. at this point?
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure. So let me start with North America. 5.1% operating margin was up from 3.9% in Q1 and 3% last Q2. You hit a nail on the head. A lot of it is the top-line growth, but it's also a lot of the efficiency we're seeing, particularly on the fulfillment and marketing lines, which for the whole company were flat year-over-year on a percent of revenue basis. So we are getting very good top-line growth. A lot of that is fueled by Prime adoption and we are dropping a lot of it to the bottom line with many of the efficiency projects.
In International we have not split countries out. What I can say is that if you adjust for foreign exchange the operating margin is up slightly both sequentially and year-over-year. What you're seeing there is also obviously colored by our investment our increased investment in India based on the momentum and the success we've been seeing there so far.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Great. Thanks.
Operator
Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just two things I wanted to ask, First on Prime Day. Brian, if you could give a little more color there on the early takeaways that you have and then also perhaps more importantly how you think that sets Amazon up for the back-to-school season and then also the holidays later in the year? And then also can you just comment on the head count, which I believe is up 18,000 or so sequentially, which I believe is the biggest number that you've ever added in a quarter. Is there anything in particular that stands out there, or just more fulfillment centers, more geography expansion as well? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Let me start with that second question first. Yes, head count was up 38% year-over-year. The vast majority of that is in operations where we are adding people for our new FCs and call centers. We continue to look for smart, innovative people who want to build on behalf of customers and – but this particular quarter is colored a bit by the operations growth.
If you look at Prime Day, we're thrilled with the results of Prime Day. It surpassed all of our expectations. Any metric we look at, everything was a huge success. Customers save millions. New Prime members signed up in higher rates than we've ever seen.
People bought more devices than on any other day. So, it's a great success. My hats off to operations team and all the people who worked on that because it was Christmas in July quite frankly, a bigger day than Black Friday, as we've said and orders increased 266% year-over-year. I'll also point out that worldwide FBA unit growth approached 300%, so not only was it a great day for Amazon, it was also a great day for our sellers which is great. So while not breaking out the impact of Prime Day specifically, it's incorporated into our guidance.
Operator
Our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein.
Carlos Kirjner-Neto - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. I may be delusional, but if I add your capital leases and CapEx that suggests that AWS capital intensity is at least 80% if not much higher. What gives you confidence that if AWS continues to grow so fast and consuming so much capital two years out you'll be able to fund its growth from the retail business. And secondly, can you help me understand why you are not ruling out Prime Now and Fresh faster? What specifically are the bottlenecks there? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Let me start with that second one. Prime Now you said, and Amazon Fresh. We are working very quickly on Prime Now. We've now expanded to nine cities, three more in the quarter including our first International city in London. So, we're moving quick, but we'd always like to move quicker obviously. On AWS I think your question was more around the ability to fund AWS? No comment specifically on that. We do realize it's a capital-intensive business and we have modeling that shows it's going to be a very – it is a very good business for us and that's what we aim for as long-term return on invested capital and free cash flow. So, we're certainly cognizant of the capital part of the calculation, so not much more I can add on that, Carlos.
Carlos Kirjner-Neto - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Heath P. Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Thanks, guys. I'm wondering if you can touch a little bit more on AWS margins. Is there a level particularly when you've been able to maintain pricing strength the way you have been, where you feel like margins start to become and that the leverage you have there start to become a catalyst for lowering prices? Or is that purely a competitive decision? And as you think about sort of AWS longer-term, is there a framework or structure that you use to think about where margins in that business should be?
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure. Thanks for your question Heath. I will point out that we have continued to lower prices. We've had multiple price cuts this year. We are now up to 49 since launch in 2006, so it is a fundamental part of our business model. So is innovation. As I said, we have over 350 new features and services – also significant features and services that have launched this year. And as we were just talking with Carlos, the capital investment is very large as well, so we continue to fund it. And we are super excited with the customer reception that we are getting and the feedback we get from large customers so we are thrilled with the business.
And price reductions are part of that model. And again, as I said earlier, we're in the long haul. We're in this for the long haul. We are looking for return on invested capital, free cash flow, and happy customers in the space.
Heath P. Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great, thanks. I really appreciate it.
Operator
Our next question comes from Youssef Squali with Cantor Fitzgerald.
Youssef H. Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities
Thank you. I guess, another question on AWS if I may. So, I want to go back to something that you said, Brian. You said that you've seen greater efficiency in the business from a cost standpoint. I was wondering if you can maybe parse that out a little more for us. Were you referring to OpEx or CapEx? And if you're referring to CapEx as well, do you feel you that you have reached escape velocity that should allow CapEx as a percentage of revenues, pricing aside, to now allow you for a constant decline in that metric, CapEx as a percentage of revenue for that that particular business? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
What I can tell you is we have seen great efficiency on the cost side, the cost to generate the capacity for AWS. I will also say that Amazon is one of the primary large customers of AWS so we see it in the consumer side of the business as well, although that's not included in AWS revenue. It's an inter-company relationship. So, we get a double whammy there. We are getting great efficiency from our external AWS business but also from our own use of AWS services.
Youssef H. Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities
Okay thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from Ron Josey with JMP Securities.
Ron V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC
Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick follow-up on Heath's question, just on the price reductions. Brian, you said earlier in the year, can you just compare the reductions earlier this year versus the ones across the board and from last year in 2Q 2014? And then a follow up just on the third-party units I think you mentioned third-party units are now 45% or maybe 47% of total units. Is there a natural limit there or it doesn't matter as long as the customer experience through FBA is seamless? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Hey Ron. So, I'll comment on the units first. We are really following the model of giving our customers as many choices as possible and letting them choose whether they want to buy first-party or third-party and I think we're working really hard to make sellers succeed on the platform. Brian touched on the success that our FDA sellers had with Prime Day, but we see FBA as a tailwind for third-party business in general.
When we surveyed those sellers in the past, in 2014 about 71% of sellers saw a 20% or greater increase in sales when they entered the FBA program. So we are really happy with what that's doing for third-party business. We're working really hard to give customers as many options as possible and allowing them to choose. And we don't really have a specific target there. It all comes down to customer choice.
On the price reduction question, we've got a long track record of driving costs out of the business and you can certainly see where we've even done that over the last several quarters if you look at the margins in AWS. We've also lowered prices for customers 49 times since launch and so it can be lumpy, but over the long haul that's the model we follow.
Ron V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC

Our next question is from Paul Vogel with Barclays Capital.
Paul Vogel - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Great, thank you. Just a question on the content side, is there any update on how engaged folks use the video side of Prime and their shopping behavior, number one. And number two, just any update on sort of your plans for growth on the content cost side? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure. On the engagement of the Prime customers, excuse me PIV customers, we have seen buying habits that look like normal Prime customers or other Prime customers from the group that comes in through the digital pipelines, but we do also see a higher pickup in retention rates and free trial conversions. So we're very happy with the linkage between our digital offerings in the Prime customer base.
On the content side, I will say that one of the factors in the sequential guidance Q2 to Q3 being lower, is two things. What we are talking about is the fulfillment center – additional fulfillment center costs that we see this time every year as we get ready for Q4 but also additional step-up in content spend, where we spend a lot of our content in Q3. You will see extensions of a lot of the successful shows that we've had so far this year. A new pilot season including Man in the High Castle and Hand of God so stay tuned for that – or seasons of Man in the High Castle and Hand of God.

Our next question comes from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.
Eugene C. Munster - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
Good afternoon, and congratulations. I just want to follow up on a previous question. In past calls you talked about an increased focus on productivity. Is that still a focus of yours? And separately, any thoughts in terms of how robotics are impacting – any updates in terms of number of robots in fulfillment centers? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure thing. Thanks for your questions, Gene. On robotics first, we don't have any new numbers to share with you, but we're super excited with the progress of that business. We had very high expectations for Amazon Robotics and its impact on our warehouse cost structure and we have been very pleasantly surprised by the job being done on that by that team. So that's looking great.
Efficiency, yes. As we've talked about in the last few calls we have even more emphasis on variable and fixed productivity. I think that's evident in the Q2 results that you've just seen. To give you a little more color on that, I would say what does that look like? We have defect reduction and process improvements are probably something we've always done and worked on, both to lower our cost but also to improve the customer experience and also the seller and vendor experience.
We're using software and algorithms to make decisions rather than people, which we think it's more efficient and scales better and will be more accurate, especially as we insert machine learning into the decisions.
As I said earlier we benefit from the efficiency gains of the AWS business on the Amazon site as well.
We look to increase the leverage of our fixed assets, particularly our fulfillment centers and the throughput of the fulfillment centers, and just generally getting inventory closer to customers as we add and expand warehouses in the sort centers that we added primarily last year. All have helped our cost structure, so just a little more color on maybe some specifics on the efficiency area.
Eugene C. Munster - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)

Our next question comes from Brian Pitz with Jefferies & Company.
Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC
Great. Thanks. Now halfway through 2015, any update or insights on your fulfillment center build-out plans for the year? If you can't disclose that, can you maybe just give us a general sense of focus and strategy? How should would be thinking about domestic versus International? As well as sortation versus traditional? What's kind of the path to build that over the next 6, 12, 18 months? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure. So we ended the year last year with 109 fulfillment centers around the world and 19 U.S. sort centers. And typically we're looking at what the demand would be for peak as we figure out what we need; so still a little early in the year to comment on that, but in the past we've given an update sometime around Q3 on that. But continuing to build as we have demand. And like Brian said, we like to be close to customers and benefit from having inventory close to customers as well. So like I said, a little early for the update at this point but something we're looking at and something the team's working really hard on.
Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC

Our next question is from Colin Sebastian with Baird Equity Research.
Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Great. Thanks and congrats on the great quarter. In the Retail business obviously a lot of variables driving growth there, we're seeing higher Prime membership levels for one, but I wonder how much of that growth you can also break down by some other factors; for example, we're seeing a notable increase in selection across longer tail categories? And then secondly, in the press release, no mention of Fire Phone. I think almost every other product was mentioned. Can we just chalk that one up now to a learning experience and an example of where Amazon is showing some discipline around investments? Or how should we think about that? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
So I'll start with the Fire Phone question. We have a policy of not commenting on our roadmap, so can't give you anything there. We obviously do learn from everything we do and value the feedback we get from customers, but nothing to share at this point. In terms of growth, we continue to see selection as a strong driver of growth. Prime is obviously very important as well; we really haven't teased those apart. FBA becomes very important as well and we've talked about some of the tailwinds we see there, and sort of the linkage between marketplace and Prime that FBA provides. So all those things are going on. As you're seeing EGM strength across a lot of the categories there, there was no single category we're really calling out, but continue to see good selection growth and good Prime growth as well.

Our next question is from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thanks, guys. So, Brian, I know you guys don't like to provide guidance beyond the next quarter but philosophically if we go back a few quarters you've characterized 2015 as a year where you believe that some of the heavier investments made in prior years should start to benefit and pay off. And we're see – we're clearly seeing that in AWS and in North America retail and it looks like you're still investing heavily on International retail. So if we kind of look out 2016, 2017, is there any high-level philosophical commentary about whether you see next year as another year of these types of trends that you're seeing now? Or are there any bigger investment areas particularly in the retail business that you might be looking to take advantage of?
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks for your question. I can't forecast into the future on that but I will reiterate the investments we have going on right now which again, we're looking to invest to strengthen the Prime platform. That includes video content including Amazon Originals, Prime Music, Prime Now. We have robust device business including the launch of a new Paperwhite Fire TV Echo with general availability and numerous other products that we're very excited about. That roadmap, we know that those devices drive customer engagement and sales. We build fulfillment centers so that we can add selection and we can add FBA partners. And we had things like same-day delivery which we talked about.
On the AWS side we continue to invest in that infrastructure. We talked about opening, announcing the region in India so there's expansion there as well. Future expansion, services expansion Internationally very similar to the U.S. on a number of the Prime fronts but also the investment in India. And then a few other things you may have seen in our press release today, the launch of Mexico which we are excited about and Amazon business.
So lots of – as I said, lots of investment in front of us. But we operate in two paths. We are definitely working for operational efficiencies in the business that we're in. We're investing wisely in things that we think are big and important. And it's not a static activity. We continue to evaluate those investments, take into account what customer response is and make changes. So I think you can look forward to the continuation of that into the future.

Our next question comes from Kerry Rice with Needham & Company.
Kerry Rice - Needham & Co. LLC
Thanks a lot. You've talked a lot about operational efficiencies. I know you guys have partnered with the post office and deliveries. Can you talk a little bit about how that is potentially benefiting and maybe the longer-term strategy with the post office? And then, you guys haven't necessarily broken this out, but I think you do generate a fair amount of revenue from advertising. I think that's in the other category. Is there anything that you can provide on advertising revenue? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure. So I'll start with the first part of that question. We definitely are delivering a lot of packages with the post office. I think most notably they did a lot of the Sunday delivery that you saw when we started launching Sunday delivery. So we try lots of things for fulfillment. We're constantly working to provide the best experience to customers and be as efficient as possible. And so we're happy with all the partners we have and continue to work with them to provide the best experience possible.
For advertising, I would remind you that certain parts of the advertising roll up into other. Some actually roll up to EGM and media, as well. So it's a business we're really excited about. We're taking a customer centric approach as we build that to make sure we're providing engaging business, engaging adds to customers and making sure we keep the customer front of mind. And it's a business that the team is excited about and working hard on.

Our next question comes from Steven Ju with Credit Suisse.
Steve D. Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Yeah. Thanks. Brian, just to follow-up on the India question earlier. I mean, o my knowledge foreign e-commerce operators such as yourself are not allowed to have first-party retail operations. But given that fulfillment enhance customer service has always been a high focus item for you guys. What steps have you taken in the country to make sure that the consumer experience there is as good if not better for the inventory on which you have no direct control?
And secondarily, similar to China, you have a pretty large population base and Internet penetration growing that's probably comparable to what was the case when you add JOYO – when you acquired JOYO. So can you provide any color on how the general operating environments are the same or different? And do you expect your growth trajectory there to be similar to what you saw in China? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
So, your first question was about the infrastructure and how we're managing the customer experience in India. So FBA, Easy Ship and some of those programs are important to us. They're very valuable for sellers to make it easy for the seller to get their goods to the customer. They're great from a customer experience standpoint because we can do what we do best with the logistics. And so there is a lot of investment and a lot of efforts going on that front.
I would say that India and China are totally different. And I think as Brian mentioned, India is a country that we're doubling down on based on the success we've seen there so far. And so very happy with the trajectory we're on there and excited to be investing and have the opportunities we do at that point.

Your next question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen & Company.
John R Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you. It appears that Amazon is growing its share of household budget driven by many factors, Prime growth and strong growth in large verticals like apparel among others. Specifically on apparel, I'm just wondering how you view the breadth of Amazon's apparel offering. Any color on that segment's performance in the second quarter. And how do you view Amazon's apparel opportunity going forward? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Thanks for your question. We have not broken out specifically apparel, but we're super excited about that business. It's growing very well. We like our position in it. We think our website is very tuned to selling online. So we're very happy with that. It is a big business for us, not only in North America but also Internationally. You mentioned a couple other consumables categories. I will say we are very happy in our consumables and hard lines categories, as well. We drive a lot of repeat business with things like Prime Pantry and Subscribe and Save and others. So, very happy with the EGM business as a whole.

And your final question comes from Scott Tilghman with B. Riley.
Scott Tilghman - B. Riley & Co. LLC
Thanks. I wanted to just follow up on a couple things. Three quick questions, first off on International I was wondering if you could compare and contrast relative performance of media and EGM? You're moving in different directions. Second, there have been a couple questions about shipping but most notable is that we had a couple price increases from the majors hit at the beginning of the year and it seems like you're costs are coming down. I was wondering if you could comment on that. And then third, just following up on Brian's question around the FCs. I was wondering how many of the facilities lend themselves to expansion rather than having to put up a new facility? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure. Let me start with the first question on International media and EGM. I think we are seeing similar trends in both geographies, those segments that EGM growth is very strong media growth has been consistent for the last four quarters. We do like the work being done by media teams. There's a lot of pipeline of invention: things like Prime Instant Video, Prime Music; all feed the Prime pipeline and Prime ecosystem, if you will. They work great with our devices by the way. They drive other non-media sales.
They are very tied together, although certainly the EGM is outpacing the media segment or media businesses right now. On transportation costs, not a lot to add there. Again, the combination of doing our own shipping and using third-party carriers so the rate increases are staged and we see those quite frequently, so nothing to add there. On the FCs and whether we would expand or build new, I think we are looking to always get the most out of the fulfillment centers that we have and as we need new facilities we place them closer and closer to customers so that can have its benefits as well, but not much more to add on that one.

Greetings. Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com Q1 2015 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.
For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please go ahead.
Phil Hardin
Hello and welcome to our Q1 2015 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO and Brian Olsavsky, Vice President and CFO of our Global Consumer Business. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 23rd, 2015 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. In addition, the release includes historical financial results of our North America, International, and Amazon Web Services reportable segments for 2014 and 2013.
During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2014.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Brian.
Brian Olsavsky
Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 47% to $7.84 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $3.16 billion.
In the supplemental financial information and business metrics portion of our earnings release, we included a few additional free cash flow measures. We believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash into capital and finance leases.
Trailing 12 month capital expenditures were $4.68 billion. Capital expenditures do not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations.
Return on invested capital is 14%, up from 9%. ROIC is trailing 12 month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 483 million shares, compared with 476 million one year ago.
Worldwide revenue grew 15% to $22.72 billion or 22%, excluding $1.3 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 20%. Active customer accounts was approximately 278 million.
Excluding customers who only had free orders in the preceding 12 month period, worldwide active customers were approximately $260 million, up from approximately $230 million in the comparable prior year period. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 44% of paid units.
Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $15.40 billion or 67.8% of revenue, compared with 71.2%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $6.62 billion or 29.1% of sales, up approximately 290 basis points year-over-year.
Fulfillment was $2.67 billion or 11.7% of revenue compared with 11.3%. Tech and content was $2.52 billion or 11.1% of revenue compared with 9.2%. Marketing was $1.05 billion or 4.6% of revenue compared with 4.3%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results. Beginning in the first quarter we changed our reportable segments to report North America, International and Amazon Web Services. In addition we have provided historical results for these segments for 2014 and 2013 with our earnings release filing today. Consistent with prior periods we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or the other operating expense line item.
In the North America segment, revenue grew 24% to $13.41 billion. Media revenue grew 5% to $2.97 billion. EGM revenue grew 31% to $10.25 billion, representing 76% of North America revenues.
North America segment operating income increased 79% to $517 million, a 3.9% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange, North America segment operating income increased 77%.
In the international segment, revenue decreased 2% to $7.74 billion. Excluding the $1.3 billion year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 14%. Media revenue decreased 12% to $2.32 billion or increased 2%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 4% to $5.38 billion or 21%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 69% of international revenues.
International segment operating loss was $76 million, compared to a loss of $33 million in the prior year period. The unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, international segment operating loss was $78 million.
In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 49% to $1.57 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income increased 8% to $265 million, a 16.9% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange, AWS segment operating income decreased 13%.
Consolidated segment operating income increased 41% to $706 million or 3.1% of revenue, up approximately 60 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI increased 45%.
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income was $255 million compared to $146 million in the prior year period.
Our income tax expense was $71 million. GAAP net loss was $57 million or negative $0.12 per diluted share, compared with a net income of $108 million and $0.23 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $5.12 billion year-over-year to $13.78 billion. Inventory increased 10% to $7.37 billion and inventory turns were 8.8, down from 9.1 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 13% to $11.92 billion and accounts payable days increased to 70 from 68 in the prior year.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance.
Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q2, 2015 we expect net sales of between $20.6 billion and $22.8 billion or growth of between 7% and 18%. This guidance anticipates approximately 750 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates.
GAAP operating income or loss to be between a $500 million loss and a positive $50 million of income, compared to $15 million loss in second quarter 2014. This includes approximately $600 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $100 million and $650 million, compared to $404 million in the second quarter of 2014.
We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions.
Phil Hardin
Great. Thanks, Brian. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Pitz with Jefferies and Company. Please proceed. Your line is live.
Brian Pitz
Thank you. Can you share with us any updated metrics for Prime Now, how sticky is it in terms of repeat customers, average order value or other details? And also any update on your fulfillments center plans for the year, if you can disclose specific numbers, maybe you could just qualitatively tell us your focus either domestic versus international or sortation versus traditional FC build out? Thanks.
Tom Szkutak
Sure. On Prime Now, we don’t have specific metrics we want to share today. But we have expanded to seven cities with more on the way. Customers are really enjoying the one hour and two delivery of tens of thousands of daily essential products.
So the response has been great. We will point out that our operations network that was – has been building for the last 20 years helps make Prime Now a viable proposition for us and scale makes a possible. So really so far customer responses are great.
Brian Olsavsky
And Brian on FCs, you know, as we've done prior years, it’s early in the year and as we progress through the year we'll give you some updates on how many. But as a reminder we ended the year with 109 fulfillment centers around the world and we'll update you as we go.
Operator
Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Ross Sandler
Great. Thanks for the new disclosure guys, really helpful. I guess, just speaking, you know, now a little bit we all understand the investments you are guys are making on international, retail, and maybe with our margins been declining.
Can you give us a little color on what's driving up the North America retail segment margin and I guess in the context of that, just talk about the impact that Prime is having on the retail margin for both North America and International? Thanks.
Brian Olsavsky
Yes, sure. So North America operating margin up a 120 basis points year-over-year to 3.9%. Lot of good cost efficiency, but again we're continuing to invest so actively as we build the Prime platform and that we have customers. So you'll see lot of invention definitely to see the Prime platform, which things like Video Content, Prime Music, as we talk about Prime Now devices that will continue to build fulfillment centers for selection and expansion in FBA. So that’s – its generally what's driving the operating margin in North America.
Tom Szkutak
And just to add on to that, we're – we gave metrics last quarter about Prime. It’s growing very fast. As Brian said, we're feeding the platform and certainly common thing with category expansion, new FCs, original content, Prime Instant Video devices, Prime Now. The common theme is they are all really intertwined with Prime and inextricably to our consumer business in Prime.
So it’s just we're happy to do it. And the last quarter we gave an indication of the growth rates after being added for 10 year. So we're super excited to have the platform and to continue to invest in it.
Ross Sandler
Great. Thanks guys.
Operator
Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.
Douglas Anmuth
Thanks for taking the question. Can you guys talk a little bit more just about the international business and kind of the key initiatives here in terms of getting the growth to reaccelerate some of these levels?
And then also perhaps little bit more on your strategy. In China how you are thinking about the cost structure there, relative to previous years and some of the key ways you might be able to rationalize things there? Thanks.
Brian Olsavsky
Yes, let me start with China. So, I think you'll see a lot invention, you're seeing a lot of invention from us in China right now. Amazon is trusted source of authentic [ph] international products and that’s really what we're doubling down on now with a Amazon global store on our own site, which gives Chinese customers access to over 1 million Amazon products globally.
And then the team of flagship store for international brands which you've heard about giving thousands of direct imported products access to – customer’s access to these products and those happen to be stocked and ready to ship from our fulfillment centers in China. So that’s an added benefit. 25% of those are exclusive – over 25% of those exclusives to Amazon.
So we continue to be selective in our investments there, but we're taking the long-term view and we have hopes for the new initiatives along the global – with the global store and the team of flagship store.
Tom Szkutak
In terms of the growth for total international, just maybe some comments first about the current quarter and then I'll elaborate little bit further. But the growth was down 2% on a dollar basis, up 14% on local currency basis. So we did see a little bit of improvement in terms of growth rate acceleration versus last couple of quarters.
And in addition to the things that Brian mentioned earlier about the Prime platform, that’s something that we're doing globally. And so we're certainly – all those things we're working on globally. So those are things that at least in most geographies we have today.
One thing to keep in mind also, as you look at growth rate for Q1, is last year Q1 we talked about in April 1st there was a consumption tax increase in Japan. We had some –we think some pre-buys in Q1 and we're overlapping that in Q1 of this year. So it’s a headwind if you think about it for Q1.
But we're looking – we think there is still a big opportunity, as we mentioned last call, big opportunity with Prime. Prime is growing at a faster rate. We think there is still a great opportunity to add unique selection to – for category expansion. And again, so we're going to continue feed the Prime platform as we talked about, continue to add selection in a lot of categories.
We're also very excited about India, if you take a look at our results for – from an operating profit standpoint, you see that it was approximately negative 76 million on a dollar basis. If you back out exchange that’s approximately breakeven, included in there we certainly have a sizeable step up in investment in India. And we're super excited from what we see there right now. We think its very big opportunity and we're investing appropriately for that big opportunity.
So those are some of things that we're working on and we think there – we still have a lot of opportunity there moving forward.
Operator
Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.
Brian Nowak
Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one is on the new inter US [ph] disclosure. Can you just help us on accounting question. The AWS data center costs related to the core e-commerce business, are those being allocated to North America and International, are those being fully embedded into the AWS segment?
And then a second question goes back to China. I guess any early learnings from the team of [ph] partnership and whether you have any thoughts or potentially a lower capital intensive grow strategy in China?
Tom Szkutak
To answer you first question, yes, they are, the associated infrastructure cost to run our North America and International consumer business those costs, those infrastructure costs are being allocated to those segments.
The second question in terms of China, its early, we're liking – certainly some of things that we're seeing there, but there is not a lot I can add to that at this stage.
Brian Nowak
Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird.
Colin Sebastian
Great. Thanks. Maybe just another follow up on the new segment disclosures. Thanks for breaking it out. You know if we assume that the advertising segment is reasonably profitable than the implication is then that the core retail business is very modestly profitable close to breakeven.
And just wondering what the thought process and strategy is behind that. If in a sense there is some subsidy to the retail side being used as you build market share in the core business? Thanks.
Tom Szkutak
Yes, I think the best way to think about it is, we certainly have an advertising part of our North American consume segments. But the way you should think about it is, we are making some great investments for the long-term and that’s really what's reflected in the operating results that you are seeing in terms of – so it is certainly impacting the operating margins both for North American and International.
So it’s the things that we – both Brian and I talked about that we're doing globally to support Prime platform all of those things that we mentioned, video content, original content, Prime Now, category expansion, investing on behalf of FBA, which also helps Prime devices. Those are all intertwined and certainly part of that. And then some of the things outside of that are more specifically related to International in addition to those are some of geographic stuff that we talked about.
So I think you should think about it that way that certainly think its big opportunity and again, one of the reasons I want to give you an update, last quarter on Prime growth and you can see that that’s going very well. And so we're feeding that and that’s what we have been doing and that’s what you see also and certainly results that you are seeing today.
Colin Sebastian
Very helpful. Thanks very much.
Tom Szkutak
Sure.

Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi.
Mark May
Thanks for taking my questions. On the international revenue I believe there is probably – there's a real distinction here between some of your more established countries and some of your more emerging countries. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about for Germany and the UK and Japan and some of the more established markets, what the profit profile of those markets look like and just how much of the international segment results are being – losses being held back by a handful of the more emerging markets.
And then a question on AWS pricing. It seemed like the pricing environment was pretty competitive last year. What are you seeing in the market this year and what are your expectations going forward? Are you expecting a bit more of a stable pricing environment? Thanks.
Tom Szkutak
Yes, in terms of International, we're not breaking out individual country results. The one thing that could mentioned around from a country perspective was India in terms of which – it certainly stepped up our investment. And if you look at it year-over-year, so that’s certainly reflected in the numbers that you are seeing.
In terms of AWS, we've had 48 price decreases since inception. The team is doing a terrific job in terms of working on behalf of customers to pass on savings as they see it. But in terms of any comment on what to expect going forward there is not really much to add there.
Brian Olsavsky
Its probably is worth adding that, although prices are factor, the primary factor for customers choosing with AWS is really around their ability to move quickly and to be nimble and agile.
And so we're very pleased with the kind of continued adoption and usage growth we've seen and obviously the benefits of AWS around their ability – customers ability to be nimble as a primary factor there.

Our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein.
Carlos Kirjner
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two. My first question is about the profitability of the North America segment. You mentioned a few minutes ago that investments in Prime were part of the – most of the explanation for what is a relatively low 3.9% margin in North America. Which are much lower than the 5% to 6% EBIT margin that [indiscernible] retailer books? Despite a large benefit of booking repeat net.
Here's the question. Prime is not new in North America. You probably have tens of millions of Prime users in the US, 30, 40, 50 million. Yet margins are still low. What gives you confidence that the investments that you are making will pay off?
Second question on AWS, if you look at expenses like R&D, perhaps even the fixed component of marketing and sales, which presumably one day will be really fixed, are this still growing significantly? In other words, is there room for significant margin expansion at some point in the future when AWS, I don’t know 2 to 5 or 10 times its current size or do you expect the need to scale up at the same rate as revenues? Thank you.
Tom Szkutak
In terms of your first question, specifically related to North America, one of the – our comments we made last quarter that we disclosed was, we disclosed the growth rate globally, as well as the growth rate in the US. And the growth rate in US after 10 years is up 50%, it was 50% year-over-year. And so 2014 versus 2013 in terms of Prime membership and that’s after a price increase on Prime from 79 to 99.
And so, it gives you a feel for the work that we put into Prime to make that experience great for customers and the value that we are giving them. So again, given that growth. And so, that’s what – that’s certainly one of the things that gives us comfort, but when we look at the individual pieces we like what we see, so in other words, some of the investments we're making, I think as we've talked about in the past, I'll give one example would be video content, both original and license content.
We mentioned last call that we spent approximately $1.3 billion on content globally for Prime customers and what we've seen and to date is was certainly still an investment for us, its certainly impacting our operating results, but we like what we see. We see customers who come in through our free trial pipeline if you will for video content. They convert it at a higher rate. We see – we have a great retention of Prime members, but those who scream actually, we retain those at a higher rate and we bring in new customers through our video pipeline.
The purchasing pattern that we have for those customers is very similar to those who come in from other pipeline. So in other words, they are buying very good from a physical product standpoint, as well as digital. So they are buying a diverse set of products.
So in other words, this video content that we're spending is helping us customers who buy consumable from us, they will buy clothing from us, they will buy shoes from us, they will buy electronics, they will buy media items.
So that’s what we're seeing and so again it’s some of these things are very early. We'll have to over time how efficient they are, but each period we go we keep the data that we see we're encouraged. And so that’s just one example.
But that’s why we're investing a lot in Prime and we think it’s a great – the Prime platform if you will, and we think it’s a great opportunity and again as I mentioned earlier all these things we're investing in are very intertwined.
Brian Olsavsky
And Carlos, I think you had a question about AWS. From our perspective its business that’s still really in day one. A lot of potential innovation in front of us we believe. And so you can see we're putting a lot of CapEx obviously there and including capital leases and we think over time we will be able to generate significant free cash flow with stronger ROICs.
Operator
Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Mahaney
Thanks. Thanks. I want to go back on North America retail margins and just I want to try to figure out, I know you're not going to go, where they could go, but if we look in the past, I assume that if the base o2014 and in full year 2013 was probably depressed for North American retail margins, North American segment margins and if we look back five or six years, it's probable that that was running at kind of mid to high single digits CSOI margins. Kind of similar to the incremental margins you just reported for that segment 8.7%.
So I guess the big question I want to ask is, is there a structural change in the North American retail business over the next – this year and the next couple years versus what you had call it in 2004 to 2009 when the margins were – I think were pretty clearly higher and now you're going to be recovering to those levels. That's what I'm trying to get at. Any color would be great? Thanks.
Tom Szkutak
Yes, the – thanks for the question Mark. Just in terms of going forward, we're not giving any specific guidance, beyond the current quarter. So I can't predict for you what could happen. But what you mentioned is, and some of the periods you were describing as you mentioned what our business look like, several years ago when we Prime was nascent and we were early – a bit earlier business.
And so we go through different cycles. We're certainly still investing very heavily. That being said, we – as I mentioned last quarter, we're spending time on making sure that we get productivity. So we're working on both investing heavily in the business, we're working on fixed and variable productivity in other areas, putting a lot more energy into it.
That’s what's helping us with the improvement that Prime mentioned in terms of operating margins year-over-year, it’s a number of different aspects, but certainly mix of business and some productivity is certainly impacting that.
But again we think there is opportunities to improve margins over time, you'll have to stay tuned on that to see what it looks like. But we certainly as you can see from not only results, but some of the data points that we've given over the last several quarters we are investing heavily in the business, again, because we like what we see and Prime growing so dramatically globally after being in it for long time and we think that that’s a great platform to feed.
Mark Mahaney
Okay. Thanks, Tom.
Operator
Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post
Hey, couple of questions on margins. First on AWS a think those are higher than most of us were thinking. Appreciate the disclosure. What is driving your margin versus your pricing decision? How do you think about passenger cost efficiencies or potential margin growth through your customers.
And then secondly on international margins you know, clearly below history, below the US, what kind of things need to happen to get those at least to where the US is today much less back to where they were six or seven years ago? Thank you.
Tom Szkutak
Justin I'll take the AWS portion of the question first. So our model over the long-term really has been to innovate and to use our scale and position to be able to pass savings along to customers. And so we've had 48 price decreases since we launched.
As I talked about earlier, that’s one factor customers save a lot of money, but the primary motivator is really around the innovation that AWS enables and the ability for developers to move really quickly.
Brian Olsavsky
And in terms of international, again as you mentioned Justin, we are investing a lot right now which impacts the margins there again ex-exchange think of it as approximately breakeven for the quarter. And so again, we're continuing to invest. We're investing in all the things that we talked about related to the platform, continue invest in some emerging geographies, most notably certainly India with the step up given the experience we have.
And so we are optimistic over time. We have a lot to do there, we think it’s a great opportunity for us. And so that’s what we're doing, but we're excited about the opportunity and that’s why you see the results that you're seeing there.
Operator
Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.
Heath Terry
Great. Thanks. Just wondering if you could give us a sense of how we should think about the run rate of CapEx and capital lease obligations in the quarter as any sort of indication for full-year and the trajectory of investment in fulfillment and data centers.
And then just on the question of a Prime and Prime Video, as we think about the way that media growth is trending now, is there a point where you start to think of allocating Prime, some of those Prime revenues to media to account for the – as Prime Video usage increases?
Brian Olsavsky
Yes, in terms of the CapEx question, there is certainly two pieces of that, there is the consumer, the North American, International piece, is a number pieces, but certainly two largest pieces which certainly be the CapEx associated with fulfillment and the second would be infrastructure. And again it’s for AWS versus North America, and International.
I'll take the North America and International first. We're seeing good growth and year-over-year in terms of overall unit growth, in terms of revenue growth, certainly ex-exchange, as I mentioned earlier, it’s early in the year. So we do every year we'll continue to monitor the growth there. We're making plans for the rest of the year and we'll get back to you as we progress throughout the year in terms of what fulfillment capacity will need to support that growth this year.
In terms of web services, it’s obviously growing extremely fast. We saw some acceleration of growth from a revenue perspective. Over the last few quarters here, usage is growing faster than that, so we will be deploying more capital as we go there.
In terms of the amounts, specific amounts, we're not giving guidance on that today and one of the reasons it is growing so fast that we wan to make sure we put the right amount of capital in place and the teams has done a great job doing all the planning and the execution around that, so that’s what we're doing there.
In terms of media, I am not fully sure I understood the question, but as it relates to I think its video, could you repeat the part of that…
Heath Terry
Right. Was just getting a sense of as video becomes such a – becomes a bigger part of the Prime value proposition, do you start to allocate some of the annual revenues from Prime more directly into that media segment. Because of the level of usage associated with Prime Video versus the shipping benefits of Prime?
Tom Szkutak
Heath, we do allocate some Prime to account for the video.
Heath Terry
Okay. Great. Thank you.
Tom Szkutak
Thanks for the question.
Operator
Our next question comes from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.
Gene Munster
Good afternoon. Could you talk little bit about the focus on the same day and same hour and specifically about the incremental investments and just some context to how big of those investments are and separately is what the strategic advantages, there is something ultimately obviously to improve the experience. But do you see in any of your data that this opens you up to be more competitive with traditional retailers? Thanks.
Tom Szkutak
Yes, I'll take that one. We certainly as I said earlier, we see this as a natural extension of our existing infrastructure investments we've – the 109 fulfillment centers, again very close to customers. It allows us and locks for a same day and next-day deliveries. And to its extreme one hour and two hour deliveries as you've seen with Prime now.
So we're not forecasting or giving much more on that, but we definitely see it as a valuable customer’s proposition, customers and braced it. Again, smaller number of azans [ph] ten to thousands of azans are available for one, two hour delivery and generally in the category, essential products that you would need in short time period.
Brian Olsavsky
And one thing I would add to that as Brian mentioned, earlier as well, we are in seven cities today and there would be more to come. We haven’t said how many, but you should be definitely expecting more to come and we're excited to do that.
Operator
Our next question comes from Robert Peck with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
Robert Peck
Yes, thank you. I was wondering Tom, could you give us an update on your retail store strategy. Should we expect stores to open up across the US or is that limited to China, New York.
And that number two, India has come up a couple of times on the call today. China had several structural challenges based on the market there. I was curious if you could differentiate what you are seeing that's different in India versus the China challenges? Thank you.
Tom Szkutak
Yes, in terms of our consumer business, we love the business that we have today. We love – we think there is a great opportunity to do that to continue to expand the existing business that we have. In terms of other things we have long standing practice of not talking about what we might or might not do there. In terms of the second part India, and China could you repeat that part, I am sorry?
Robert Peck
Sure. So you talked about India a couple of times today on the call. Obviously it's big area of investment focus for the company. China has some structural challenges based on how the marketplace is. I was wondering if you could differentiate what you are seeing in India that makes you optimistic there versus some of the challenges you faced in China?
Tom Szkutak
Yes. Thank you for the question. They are very different, you'll see the growth rate in India is very rapid. We talked about last year and its increasing investment. I think the biggest differences there focused on sellers and the connection of sellers.
A big part of the challenge there is helping sellers all across India to succeed and grow their online businesses, you'll see from our press release that we've launched a new apps for that. So that helps them manage our inventory better and also respond to customer inquires. So that’s probably the biggest difference that we see between India and China. But and still very, very early on in India.
Operator
Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.
Jason Helfstein
Thanks. So can you talk about how the impact on available third-party SKUs impacts the business, particular in Europe and ultimately what you could do to drive more SKUs through the platform, whether it's lowering third-party rates or is it other factors to try to get more SKUs on their after a third-party?. Thanks.
Tom Szkutak
We spent a tremendous amount of time on our seller business over the years and trying to improve both the experience for sellers, as well as customers. And we've done a lot of interesting things to help sellers and that’s why you see the results that we're seeing today 44% of our units today, as of this quarter, our third party units, that’s up about 400 basis points from last year.
Certainly one of the things that we've talked about its most, that’s notable is fulfillment by Amazon. And so the benefit for sellers is they get to take advantage of our multi newer fulfillment network globally, we have a 109 fulfillment centers globally, as well as our customers get to take advantage of that as prime numbers where we offer in those geography.
So it’s really a great benefit for sellers, its good for sellers, its good for customers and we believe good for share owners too. So again, we're very excited, number of different things we're working on, but certainly one of the drivers along with all of the things that I mentioned is certainly FBA is very helpful.
Operator
Our next question comes from Mark Miller with William Blair and Company
Mark Miller
Hi, good afternoon. Looking at the service sales less the AWS revenues you've got a $4 billion in fees mostly coming from the marketplace off a strong mid-30%. Help us think about the cost that go against those marketplace fees and specifically within fulfillment if you could help us understand how much of the cost is going against 3P are basically FBA fulfillment, perhaps percent of units part of the FC's that are going to 3P?
Tom Szkutak
So Mark, I can't comment on the derive number, but I can say that FBA continues to grow really well, it’s become a bigger and bigger part of our third party mix over the years. I think we gave you an update in Q4 that it was more than 40% of our third party units.
Obviously in the fulfillment line there is cost associated with that as well, as our other third party units as well I think like payment processing and other cost that we incur. So I don’t know if there is much more we can say about that.
Mark Miller
If I can insert a second question, given the upside and profitability in the first quarter, the guidance for the second quarter quite a bit lower. What are the factors you see that are negatives or I guess otherwise people can I think you are sandbagging? Thanks.
Tom Szkutak
Let's take a look at the guidance that we gave, again, we gave as we have in previous quarters, we gave the wide range and from a consolidate segment operating standpoint we gave a 100 to 650, the implied margin at the lower end, the higher end is approximately 50 basis points upwards to 2.9%.
This quarter in Q1 we were up 60 basis points year-over-year in total at the upper end of that forecast implied would be up 80 basis points, so again, that’s the range and we think its appropriate range for Q2.
Operator
Our final question comes from Ron Josey with JMP Securities.
Ron Josey
Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just going back to margins a little bit more on AWS. As a look at the seasonality, I'm wondering if there's any seasonality in margins because it looks like margins 2Q and 3Q came in sub 10% versus mid teens in 4Q and 1Q and then sort of looking at it a different way, maybe given the different profitability into 2Q of last year, did that have any impact on the pricing cuts in April?. Thanks very much.
Tom Szkutak
So, let's start with the increase you saw sequentially in margin from Q2 or Q3 to Q4 of 2014, so revenue grew by about 21.5% sequentially and expense grew by around 10% so obviously we were growing faster in top line and expenses.
Over the long-term improvements and efficiency and innovation allow us to drive that kind of cost out of the business. I mean there is certainly was an impact with pricing changes and you probably saw some of that in Q2 as well, but over the long-term that’s the model we follow.
Ron Josey
Great. Thank you.
Tom Szkutak
And with that, thank you joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on investor relations website at least through the end of the quarter.

Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2014 financial results teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.
For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please go ahead.
Phil Hardin
Hello and welcome to our Q4 2014 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our Chief Financial Officer and Brian Olsavsky, Vice President and CFO of our Global Consumer Business. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, January 29, 2015 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.
During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2013.
Now, I will turn the call over to Tom.
Tom Szkutak
Thanks, Phil. I will begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 25% to $6.84 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased to $1.95 billion. In the supplemental financial information and business metrics portion of the earnings release, we included a few additional free cash flow measures. We believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with capital and finance leases.
Trailing 12 month capital expenditures were $4.89 billion. Capital expenditures does not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. Return on invested capital is 9%, down from 13%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by the average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter-ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 483 million shares compared with 476 million one year ago.
I will turn the call over to Brian for additional financial highlights.
Brian Olsavsky
Thanks, Tom. Worldwide revenue increased 15% to $29.33 billion or 18% excluding $895 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Media revenue decreased to $6.95 billion, down 4%. Excluding FX, media revenue was flat year-over-year. EGM revenue increased to $20.64 billion, up 21% or 24% excluding FX. Worldwide EGM increased to 70% of worldwide sales, up from 67%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 20%. Worldwide active customer accounts were approximately 270 million. Worldwide paid Prime members increased 53% year-over-year. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than two million. Seller units represented 43% of paid units, Fulfillment by Amazon or FBA units represented more than 40% of seller units. Worldwide active Amazon Web Services customers exceeded one million.
Now I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $20.67 billion or 70.5% of revenue compared with 73.5%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $7.62 billion or 25.9% of sales, up approximately 300 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $3.33 billion or 11.3% of revenue compared with 11.1%. Tech and content was $2.41 billion or 8.2% of revenue compared with 6.6%. Marketing was $1.49 billion or 5.1% of revenue compared with 4.3%.
Now let's talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or the other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 22% to $18.75 billion. Media revenue grew 1% to $3.54 billion. EGM revenue grew 27% to $13.53 billion, representing 72% of North America revenues, up from 69%. Other revenue grew 43% to $1.67 billion. North America segment operating income increased 40% to $1.02 billion, a 5.4% operating margin.
In the international segment, revenue grew 3% to $10.58 billion. Excluding the $872 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 12%. Media revenue decreased 8% to $3.41 billion or a decrease of 1% excluding foreign exchange and EGM revenue grew 10% to $7.11 billion or 19% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 67% of international revenues, up from 63%.
International segment operating income was $20 million, down from $151 million in prior year. Consolidated segment operating income increased 18% to $1.04 billion or 3.5% of revenue, up approximately 10 basis points year-over-year. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income was $591 million compared operating income of $510 million in the prior year.
Our income tax expense was $205 million. GAAP net income was $214 million or $0.45 per diluted share compared with a net income of $239 million or $0.51 per diluted share.
Now I will discuss the full year results. Revenue increased 20% to $88.99 billion or 20%, excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. North America revenue grew 25% to $55.47 billion and international revenue grew 12% to $33.52 billion or 14%, excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Consolidated segment operating income decreased 9% to $1.81 billion or 10% excluding the favorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange and operating margin was 2% compared to 2.7% in the prior-year. GAAP operating income decreased 76% to $178 million.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $4.97 billion year-over-year to $17.42 billion. Inventory increased 12% to $8.30 billion and inventory turns were 8.6, down from 8.9 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 9% to $16.46 billion and accounts payable days decreased to 73 from 74 in the prior-year.
And now back to Tom with guidance.
Tom Szkutak
Thanks, Brian. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.
For Q1 2015, we expect net sales of between $20.9 billion and $22.9 billion or growth of between 6% and 16%. This guidance anticipates approximately 460 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between $450 million loss and $50 million in income, compared to $146 million in income in the first quarter of 2014. This includes approximately $450 million for stock-based compensation and the amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between zero and $500 million in income compared to $502 million income in the first quarter of 2014.
I will conclude my portion of today's call with an update on our reportable segments. We expect to change our reportable segments to report North America, international and Amazon Web Services, beginning with first quarter of 2015. We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for our shareholders.
Thanks and with that, Phil, let's move to questions.
Phil Hardin
Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Brian Pitz with Jefferies and Company. Please proceed with your question. Your line is live.
Brian Pitz
Hello. Can you hear me? Hi, guys. Just a quick question. You had a strong holiday season. 100 million more items shipped for free this holiday, while FBA units was up 50% and fulfillment expense remain relatively flat. How did you manage that? Are the new sortation that was essentially the key to controlling shipping costs? And what percent of units sold are FBA? Thank you.
Tom Szkutak
Sure. In terms of the last part of your question, the percentage of FBA units of third-party paid physical units are over 40% and in terms of the fulfillment discussion, certainly Q4 is our most seasonal quarter. You can see that we get a little bit better leverage, I should say, than we have gotten in other quarters. Again, most seasonal quarter. Not a lot to add to that but we continue to ship on behalf of retail offerings as well as FBA that's included in that.
Brian Pitz
Great. Thanks.
Operator
And our next question comes from Katie Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Katie Huberty
Yes. Thanks. There's a headline on the tape referencing improving productivity in 2015. So I just wondered if you could clarify what areas of the business you are focused on in terms of productivity? And then what are some of the projects or areas that we should be prepared to see a large uptick in investment in 2015?
Tom Szkutak
Yes. I think that you are referring to is, I mentioned on a earlier call, that we do an annual planning process. We actually start it in the late-summer, early fall. We go through that process. We take a break for the seasonal holidays and then we get back to it. We are in the process of finalizing it right now. And the teams are putting even more energy and attention on driving what we would call fixed expense and variable expense productivity as well as other efficiency projects. So there's many, many different pieces that go into that. But certainly we have added a lot of people and structure over the last several years. And so we have been putting folks on that. But we are just putting even more folks on it as we finalize our plans for 2015.
Katie Huberty
And what areas should we expect big upticks in investment in 2015?
Tom Szkutak
In terms of investment, certainly we are going to continue to support the growth of the business. You should expect that we will be spending more in terms of CapEx to support our web services business which is growing very fast. You should expect us to add fulfillment capacity, as we have done in prior years. We have updated you a bit as we have gone along and so we will do that from time-to-time during the year as well in 2015. So stay tuned on that.
Katie Huberty
Thank you.

Our next question comes from Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Please proceed you are your question.
Ron Josey
Great. Thanks for taking the question. Real quickly on fulfillment cost. It looks like the overall cost is already quite a bit, around 17% growth in 4Q from 30% in 3Q. I am wondering if anything specific led to that improved overall growth from, is it maybe the key of a rollout? And then quickly, I think there was mentioning around breaking out AWS results. Wondering if any reason now? Perhaps it's getting to a level that you have to do it? Thank you.
Tom Szkutak
Yes. In terms of the fulfillment piece, it's not a lot of callouts on that. We had unit growth of 20% year-over-year. Certainly our FBA is growing at a faster rate. The sellers were up 65% over years who did 40% of our units. And again, the team continues to work on getting productivity there. In terms of AWS, we just think it's an appropriate way to look at our business for 2015. And so our plan is to separating it out as of Q1 of this year.
Operator
Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Kaizad Gotla
Thanks. This is Kaizad Gotla, in for Doug. I think you noted Prime is growing faster internationally than it is in North America. So can you help us reconcile that with the difference between your North America and international EGM growth rates?
Tom Szkutak
If you take a look, what I mentioned was, Prime, worldwide is up 53% year-over-year. so it's growing very fast globally. It's 50% growth in the U.S. and even higher in international. And so the reason both are contributing to the growth rates that you are seeing. But we are certainly at a earlier stage in international. So it's an opportunity for us, but in terms of the number of Prime members relative to the U.S. is smaller. So it's an earlier phase. So again, as we continue to grow that, it's an opportunity for us and certainly something that we are focused on.
Operator
The next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your questions.
Carlos Kirjner
Hi. I have two questions. Can you comment on your view of the relative value proposition of Prime in European markets and Japan? Is it similar to the U.S.? Two-day shipping and all the other benefits? Or is it different? Because we think, for example, that penetration of Prime in the European markets is much lower and you have told us that the number of Prime SKUs is much lower in the U.K., for example. So what's the fundamental cause of that? Why is it that Prime in the U.K. is not as developed as in the U.S.? Is it timing or is it the proposition?
The second question is about AWS. You have a leadership position now and it's a very large market and it's easy to see from the outside that you are hiring aggressively, both in engineering and sales. Given the size of the opportunity and your position, what specifically prevents you from hiring faster, developing more products, investing more? How do you balance? What prevents you from doing that? Why wouldn't you invest twice or three times as much in AWS? Thank you.
Tom Szkutak
In terms of, I will take the AWS one first, we are expanding very rapidly. We have been hiring a lot of great people over the past few years and several years. We do think it's a big opportunity. We are making sure we keep the hiring bar really high to make sure we bring in great resources like we do across all of Amazon and we are super excited about the opportunity. So we are investing very heavily. You see that certainly in our CapEx numbers and the assets we are acquiring with some of the capital leases you see that represented. So again we are investing very heavily, both in terms of people as well as capital for that business and we share your excitement about the business.
In terms of from the Prime piece, the proposition is a bit different by geography and we continue to make it better in all the geographies that we have Prime. That's something that we are focused. The shipping speed is different by geography a bit, but the focus is all about how we make sure that we get a great experience for customers in those geographies. But the one thing is different is, you mentioned is that, the proposition or the timing. So the proposition is a little bit different, but we will continue to work on making it better for all the geographies we have it in. But the timing is different. We did launch in the U.S. first. And then we launch in other geographies following that. So as a result, it's just earlier in these other geographies. So we still think it's a very good opportunity and something that we are focused on.
Operator
Our next question comes from Mark May with Citigroup.
Mark May
Thanks for taking my question. One on, I am sorry if I missed this, what's your thought or outlook for pricing in the AWS Cloud business for this year? It was obviously quite fierce last year. Do you think it will be quite as competitive in 2015?
And then in the media business, we have been hearing data points about a slowdown in the eBook space. Are you seeing that? And what's your outlook? Do you see any hope for the media segment to improve as a result of that? Thanks.
Tom Szkutak
In terms of the first question, we have continued to lower prices for customers in web services. Certainly that's something that we have been focused on. Since early launch, it's something we continue to focus on. It's hard to predict what will happen going forward. So I really can't comment on what we might or might not do there. But certainly it's something that we had, since launch, we have had many, many, it's in the high 40s, I think, in terms of pricing actions there. So we are very excited to make sure that we have great prices for customers.
In terms of the media, you are seeing an overall media growth globally. You are seeing some softness in the growth rate there. I just want to point out certainly one of the larger factors or largest factor that's in that number is, keep in mind that we have video game consoles that are part of the media growth numbers or the media absolute numbers. And last year it was a very strong year for new console launches. And so what happens is, when you have those launches, you also have video games that are -- the video game sales themselves are also strong. So for example, if you look at North American media growth rate in Q4 of this past year, you are seeing that impact. So that's what you are seeing there.
Operator
Our next question from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Mahaney
Great. Thanks. Hi, Tom. Can I ask you a high-level question?
Tom Szkutak
Sure. Go for it, Mark.
Mark Mahaney
Okay. Amazon has always pitched itself in terms of price, selection and convenience to customers. And I saw this great survey work that was done by Morgan Stanley in the last couple of weeks about this global survey that indicated a little bit of the shift in consumers' interest in online commerce more towards convenience. You must have a pretty good feel at Amazon for whether that broad value proposition to consumers is shifting. If it's shifting to be slightly less sensitive to price over the last couple of years and more towards convenience. Are you seeing that kind of shift? There's a lot of implications if that is, in fact, what is happening.
Tom Szkutak
I would say it this way, in terms of customer reaction, you see it really across the fundamental inputs that we have talked about for a long time. So in other words, in terms of speed of delivery and convenience, we see that with Prime members. Prime members are buying more. It's more convenient. They are getting their physical product to them faster versus being not a Prime member. So we certainly see that. So that's certainly speed of delivery helps. We need to make sure and it's something that we are always focused on is making sure we have great prices and that's every single item across categories, across geographies. So it's something we are focused on.
We do think that's important for customers. And we need to have the selection, be in stock. When a customer comes to our detail page, it matters. And so I don't view it as a shift. I view it as there is certainly a lot of visibility and transparency around all of these. That's what shopping and operating a business online does. There is just amount of transparency. We think we like that world. And that's something that we continue to focus on those inputs so that we can be successful in that world and that's not something new. That's something we have been focusing on for a long time.

Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.
Jason Helfstein
Hi. Thanks. Two questions. One, just if you can clarify any impact of the Fire phone in the quarter? And then secondly, can you talk about how fuel prices impact your model? And I know the shippers, they use a trailing index to calculate fuel, how those savings would show up? Or if you would pass those on to third parties, et cetera? Thanks.
Tom Szkutak
Yes. I don't have really any callout for the Fire phone. We continue to sell. I had mentioned, we have a little bit over $80 million of inventory at the end of the Q3 and it will continue to sell through that in Q4. In terms of fuel prices, not a lot to callout there in terms of impact on the quarter. Certainly, over a long period of time, if it's sustainable we should see some benefits there.
Operator
Our next question comes from Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray.
Gene Munster
Good afternoon. Over the past couple of years, it's just been a little bit of a roller coaster with margins for investors. There is points of optimism followed by points of frustration and there is really some optimism here in this report. Is there anything that you can help investors with to understand just how you think about different cycles of investing to try to smooth out some of this roller coaster mentality that happens with the stock? Thanks.
Tom Szkutak
Well, in terms of, I would describe it this way, Gene, we have a lot of opportunities in front of us that we have talked about and we are also being selective with those opportunities. We have added lot of resources over the past few years. We certainly have been in the heavy investment cycle. I mentioned earlier we are in the process of finalizing our plan for 2015. We always put energy into various productivity measures but we are putting, the team is putting even more focus on those efforts as we finalize our 2015 plans. We will have to see where that ends up, but we are putting more energy and focus around our various fixed productivity or expense productivity, efficiency projects and again a wide range of different activities. And so that's what we are doing and you will have to stay tuned to see how that progresses as we go.

Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Sandler
Hi. Thanks, Tom. I have two questions. First on India, can you talk about the India opportunity broadly and maybe some advantages you may have versus some of the local peers in terms of leveraging your scale? That market appears to be just on fire right now. So just a little bit of color on India.
And then on Prime, can you talk about the Prime member behavior in terms of purchasing frequency? How it looks today versus may be a Prime member that joined two years ago? I know it looks a lot different from those very early Prime adopters from six, seven years ago. But just more recently, over the last couple of years, is the behavior consistent as you grow the base? Thanks.
Tom Szkutak
Sure. In terms of India, we think it's very, very early. We are investing certainly in India and we think it's a very interesting opportunity. We have a very good team there and we are excited to participate. Again we think it is very early and so we like the opportunity there.
In terms of Prime, there is not a lot I can help you with on that. But what I would say is this, certainly as you think about customers who are not Prime that become Prime, we see a very sizable step up their purchasing patterns. And so the customers are certainly buying a lot more from us. And one of the things that we are seeing, another thing that we are seeing is certainly, as Jeff references and I quote, ""Prime has evolved. It is both a physical and digital offering. It's unique that way.""
We see, for example, although it's still very early and we are learning and investing in this area, but I take video content, for example, what we see is customers that come in who come in through our Prime pipeline for video for free trial, those customers are converting at higher rates than other channels. We see that customers that are video streamers, even though we have high renewal rates, they are renewing at even higher rates than others. We see those people who were customers who were streaming have very similar purchase patterns on the physical product side as those who don't.
And so we view that as a positive. So it's very integrated from a customer experience standpoint which we think is great. And so those are the things that we are seeing in Prime right now. And with Prime being almost 10 years old, growing at 53% year-over-year on a sizable base, tens of millions, we think is very interesting. It's something that we are very focused on as we continue forward.
Operator
Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS Investment Research.
Eric Sheridan
Thanks for taking the question. On the topic of China, I wanted to know if you could help us either qualitatively or quantitatively understand what the trajectory or the size of the business is in China? And then maybe the trajectory around investments needed to compete in China? And how you think about the opportunity there long-term, looking through the lens of the competitive landscape and maybe Amazon's particular skill set on going to market in China? Thanks.
Tom Szkutak
Sure. We haven't broken out the size of the business. I can't help you much there, but we continue to work on the customer experience there. The team has some interesting ideas that you will have to stay tuned on, of how to make that experience better. And we continue to work on it. So there is not a lot more that I can add to that.
Operator
Our next question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen and Company.
John Blackledge
Great. Thanks. Just a couple of questions. In North American media, aside from the video game impact, just wondering if there are any other factors driving the low or flattish growth year-over-year? And then, CapEx was up about 40% in 2014. It's kind of bounced around over the years. Just wondering if you can give us a sense of the level of growth in 2015? Thanks.
Tom Szkutak
Sure. In terms of the North American media, a number of different certainly puts and takes there, but certainly by far the biggest one is the one I called out, which is the video game console. So if you look at the growth rate in Q4 last year, meaning 2013 and Q4 2014, you see a big difference. And the biggest, the most sizable difference there is certainly the video game consoles portion and the video games associated with those. So another way to say it is, the video game consoles and video games portion of that is down year-over-year and obviously years ago we put the videogame consoles as part of North American media to keep it with video games and they are larger ASP items as well that go in there. So certainly having an impact on that one when you look at the growth or when you compare Q4 2013 growth to Q4 2014 growth there.
In terms of CapEx, we are not giving guidance on the 2015 spend, but given the high usage rates that we have had in web services, you should expect that we will be spending CapEx to support that growth and we will certainly be adding new fulfillment centers as we go. Also keep in mind that we do also finance capital. So if you look at our capital lease activity point to that, that's also increased in activity over the last few years. Certainly a number of different types of CapEx that go into that financing, but the biggest piece is certainly infrastructure to support our business primarily on the AWS side. So again that's also included in that number.
Operator
Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.
Heath Terry
Great. Thanks. Tom, I was hoping you could give us some kind of sense of the impact on delivery times and conversion rates that you saw during this holiday season from the investments that you made in fulfillment, particularly the sortation centers that were added before the holidays? And then also, to what degree you have seen some leverage, or some of the slower growth in fulfillment costs from moving more of the fulfillment obligation to first party owned infrastructure?
Tom Szkutak
Sure. In terms of the sort centers and I would say, just in addition to sort centers, what's happened over the course of last several years is, with all the fulfillment centers that we have added, we have actually invested gotten selection closer to customers. And so that's helped us from a delivery speed standpoint. It's helped us from a cost standpoint in terms of transportation cost being closer to customers. And so you it's a natural result of the footprint that we have added.
In terms of sortation centers, there is a lot of different benefits of that. But certainly one of them is, as you get closer and closer, certainly throughout the year, it's helped us with holiday deliveries, it's helped us with Sunday deliveries and as we have closer to, in this case December to the end of holidays, it's certainly helped us from a delivery to the customer standpoint. So we are very pleased with the performance of those sortation centers. And really the global team of fulfillment team around the world, I think they did a terrific job during the holiday season as they did throughout the year.

Our next question comes from Mark Miller with William Blair and Company.
Mark Miller
Hi. Good afternoon. There's quite a disparate performance between North America and international in terms of the profit change year-on-year, up nearly $300 million, North America down over $100 million. So could you just help us understand why the international performance is so much weaker? Perhaps give us some color on the established markets in Europe relative to emerging markets. In the past, you have also discussed Japan. And then, is there an inflection point where international profits we could expect to head up again?
Tom Szkutak
Sure. The first one is, certainly the growth rates are slower in international versus North America, certainly would have an impact. The second, as we continue to invest in international in terms of adding capacity for infrastructure, for fulfillment capacity, as you know, if you look at our international growth rates, the unit growth rates are actually growing at a higher rate than revenue. And then emerging geographies. We talked about India earlier. Very excited about India. We are investing in India. We are also investing in China. So those are certainly impacting the results as well.
Operator
Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post
Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask about gross margins. They were up quite a bit year-over-year and it looks like, in our numbers, EGM beat and media missed. So any thoughts on the mix shift there helping or hurting gross margins? What are the key drivers for that line and can AWS continue to drive that in 2015? Thank you.
Tom Szkutak
Certainly, AWS mix of business is having an impact. AWS is certainly part of that and impacting that. Also just to keep in mind, our third-party unit growth is growing at a faster rate than retail and so certainly that's having an impact. And then obviously, continuing to lower prices for customers as well as working with our partners on the vendor side to support those activities from a pricing standpoint. So those are the dynamics. And in terms of 2015 beyond the guidance that we are giving, there is not a lot of callout there, but we have had a great success of being able to grow our retail offerings. Our marketplace side has grown very nicely over the years including 2014. The team has done a great job there. Fulfilled by Amazon, in terms of number of sellers, continue to grow there. The percentage of paid physical units are approximately 40%, a little over 40% of the total there. So that's become much more meaningful over the past several years. So very happy about that. So all those contribute to the numbers that you just talked about.

Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird.
Colin Sebastian
Great. Good afternoon. One question as a follow-up on AWS and specifically some of the announcements related to WorkMail and WorkSpaces. This would signal that Amazon is moving up the stack towards a more of a SaaS offering. Is that the right interpretation? And if so, should we expect a broadening of those SaaS product initiatives? Thank you.
Tom Szkutak
I am very happy to make a launch that you mentioned, we think it's exciting. It's certainly, you know we are excited overall about web services offerings. The team has done an incredible job in terms of innovation as well as operating these large services that scale. So they are doing a terrific job. In terms of what we might or might not do in the future, we are not talking about what that roadmap is. You will have to stay tuned.

Our next question comes from Ben Schachter with Macquarie Equity Research.
Ben Schachter
Tom, can you just give any color on how you are evaluating the opportunities to show video advertising against the ever-increasing video content? Thanks.
Tom Szkutak
We really aren't using advertising too much in that area. You have seen it a little bit on some of our original content but beyond that we really can't comment. We think the experience we have is great for customers. We get a lot of positive feedback on the content that we have there and the uninterrupted content, if you will. And so I wouldn't speculate on what we might or might not do there. But we are getting great feedback from customers.

Thank you for standing by. Good day everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com Q3 2014 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.
For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please go ahead.
Phil Hardin
Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2014 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 23, 2014 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.
During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2013.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom.
Tom Szkutak
Thanks, Phil.
I'll begin with comments on our third quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 15% to $5.71 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $1.08 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.63 billion.
The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operation.
Return on invested capital was 6%, up from 3%. ROIC is trailing 12-month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter-ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 481 million shares compared with 475 million one year ago.
Worldwide revenue grew 20% to $20.58 billion or 20% excluding the $13 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange.
Media revenue increased to $5.24 billion, up 4% or 4% excluding exchange. EGM revenue increased to $13.95 billion, up 26% or 26% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 68% of worldwide sales, up from 65%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 21%. Active customer accounts was approximately 260 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 42% of paid units.
Now I'll discuss our operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $14.63 billion or 71.1% of revenue compared with 72.3%. Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content and G&A combined was $6.09 billion or 29.6% of sales, up approximately 350 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $2.55 billion or 12.4% of revenue compared with 11.5%. Tech and content was $2.22 billion or 10.8% of revenue compared with 9.2%. Marketing was $961 million or 4.7% of revenue compared with 3.9%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results. And consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item.
In the North America segment, revenue grew 25% to $12.87 billion. Media revenue grew 5% to $2.73 billion. EGM revenue grew 31% to $8.79 billion, representing 68% of North America revenues, up from 65%. Other revenue grew 40% to $1.34 billion. North America segment operating income decreased 70% to $88 million, a 0.7% operating margin.
In the international segment, revenue grew 14% to $7.71 billion. Excluding the $21 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 13%.
Media revenue grew 4% to $2.51 billion or 3% excluding foreign exchange and EGM revenue grew 20% to $5.16 billion or 19% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 67% of international revenues, up from 64%. International segment operating loss was $224 million compared to international segment operating loss of $28 million in the prior period.
Consolidated segment operating loss was $136 million compared to consolidated segment operating income of $267 million in the prior period. Consolidated segment operating loss includes charges of approximately $170 million, primarily related to the Fire phone inventory evaluation and supplier commitment cost.
Unlike CSOI, GAAP operating income or loss includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating loss was $544 million compared to operating loss of $25 million in the prior period.
Our income tax benefit was $205 million, GAAP net loss was $437 million or $0.95 per diluted share compared with a net loss of $41 million and $0.09 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities decreased $806 million year-over-year to $6.88 billion. Inventory increased 21% to $7.32 billion and inventory turns were 8.9, down from 9.2 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 18% to $11.81 billion and accounts payable days decreased to 74 from 75 in the prior year.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions.
Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance.
Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlement, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they’ve been recently.
For Q4 2014, we expect net sales of between $27.3 billion and $30.3 billion or growth between 7% and 18%. This guidance anticipates approximately 250 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between $570 million loss and $430 million income compared to $510 million of income in the fourth quarter of 2013. This includes approximately $470 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense to be between $100 million loss and $900 million in income compared to $876 million in income in the fourth quarter of 2013.
We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareowners.
Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move to questions.
Phil Hardin
Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call.

Sure, in terms of back-to-school, certainly the results are reflected in the Q3 results that you see today. There's a number of different impacts back-to-school has.
One thing I would like to call out, as you look at our North American media growth rates one thing that we are seeing is certainly a shift from a text book standpoint from purchase to rental and so we see a lot more customers renting. So you see that impacting the growth rate a bit the North American media.
But in terms of Q4 as in any Q4, when we look at it, there is a wide range of outcomes. We're giving a wide range of guidance. What we feel good about is we have a team that's been improving customer experience over the past twelve months.
We're very excited to serve customers. We've had a lot of unique selection. We've got inventory closer to the customers. Many, many different things that we're doing on behalf of customers. So we are very excited about the holiday season and look forward to serving customers.
In terms of Twitch, we're very excited to have Twitch as part of our overall team. We've been in video games for quite some time and we think that it's a very creative team.
They're doing some very innovative things on behalf of their customers and our customers and so we're excited to have them, be part of Amazon and look forward to working together with that team.
Brian Pitz - Jefferies
Great. Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question will come from Carlos Kirjner analyst with Bernstein.
Carlos Kirjner - Bernstein
Thank you for taking my question. Two if I may. International CSOI margin this quarter were the lowest they have been in years, maybe ever, I don’t know. We know you have been investing internationally but has something changed fundamentally and if yes, what?
Secondly, I wanted to ask you about vast difference in revenue growth rate between your international and domestic business. What is fundamentally different between the U.S. and your main international markets and is this difference fundamental or temporary? Thank you.
Tom Szkutak
Thank you. Thanks for the question. In terms of the consolidated segment or the segment operating income, excuse me, for international, certainly versus what you'd have seen last quarter some notable changes, one is we're certainly getting ready for the holiday season, so as to get ready for the holiday season.
We are expanding from a capacity standpoint. We do see -- we've gotten great penetration and Fulfilled by Amazon customers. So you'll see that actually our growth rate -- unit growth rate is actually higher than our revenue growth rate and so that's what we've been experiencing so certainly adding capacity from a fulfillment perspective, adding capacity from a infrastructure standpoint. If you look at our overall operating expenses, we are certainly investing and with the slower growth rate you're not seeing as -- certainly not seeing as much leverage. We understand that we do have to get leverage over time, but we are investing right now. We're also investing in newer emerging geographies including India and Italy and Spain and continue to invest in China. 
And then one other call out, we -- mentioned in my opening remarks there was approximately $170 million impact related to inventory evaluation and supplier commitment costs, a vast majority of that was in North America, but there was about $25 million in international just to let you know that that's there.
In terms of the growth rate, it has been softer across a number of geographies. If you look back over the past really four quarters, we've seen a little bit of volatility between the quarters, but it's been softer.
We continue to focus on the inputs and we still think international is a very big opportunity for us in terms of growth. More recently if you look at the growth rate for Q3 and you see the 13% excluding foreign exchange, you may remember on the last call about 90 days ago, I talked about Q2 what had happened was we had seen -- in late Q1 we had seen a ramp up in Japan before the consumption tax increase happened on April 1.
We saw a pretty sizable drop off in Japan growth rates from Q1 to Q2, which brought that down. The only update again is the number of different puts and takes by geographies, but the only other comment I would say is that we really haven’t seen Japan growth rates improving since Q2. So that's something that's there.
But in terms of the fundamentals, long term we're very excited about international as well as North America. We think it's a big opportunity. We continue to focus on the inputs. Some of those inputs are certainly on the media side working on the conversion from physical media to digital media.
We continue to work on that in a number of different ways. We continue to add new selection in those geographies and work on the retail basics and so again we're very excited about the opportunity.
Carlos Kirjner - Bernstein
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next call will come from analyst Scott Devitt with Stifel.
Scott Devitt - Stifel Nicolaus
Hey Tom, thanks. I had a question just broadly. A lot of the capital that's been deployed in terms of planting seeds and new businesses have worked out very well, but given what's happening right now in terms of the deterioration in the margin structure as growth is slowing, I am just wondering and I think a lot of investors have this question as well and in terms of when things don't go as anticipated in some of the bigger projects where there is not a revenue stream like areas maybe like some of the hardware projects and China and other markets, what's the process for determining whether to plough ahead or turn back capital and redeploy in another areas. Thanks.
Tom Szkutak
Thanks for the question Scott. With anything new that we do and obviously we've done -- as you mentioned we've done a lot of new things. There is certainly a wide range of outcome and we certainly understand that. We try to learn from everything that we do as we launch new opportunities and so that's something across things that go great and things that don't go as well as others. We try to learn from that.
And so the way I will describe it is from a looking forward standpoint we still think that we have a lot of opportunities. That said, we need to be very selective about what opportunities we pursue and so that's again the way we're thinking about it and probably not much more I can add to it than that.
Scott Devitt - Stifel Nicolaus
Okay. Thank you.
Tom Szkutak
Sure.
Operator
And we'll continue on to analyst Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets
Two questions please. That $170 million in charges related to the Fire phone, where was that put in the P&L and which are the OpEx lines or was it a COGS?
And then secondly on the media side, you talked about maybe seeing a negative impact or definitely seeing a negative impact from the switch towards owning to renting. Do you think that's a broader trend beyond just text books that affects all media retailers including Amazon? Could that have been -- could that be one of the issues behind the slow media growth in international markets and if so, is there really a solution to that other than your own rental -- your own rental models? Thank you.
Tom Szkutak
Sure. In terms of the first question, the $170 million, it's predominately in COGS and so it's the very vast majority than COGS and then in terms of the split about 25 million is in international and the remainder is in North America.
In terms of the growth, we certainly are seeing that in text books. We do see another - digital media, we're certainly seeing rentals being part for our portfolio more than we had probably during - certainly with physical, but in terms of some of the recent growth rates, the one that I called out related to book rentals are certainly impacting North American media.
One of the other things that’s certainly impacting it too is we did had some things last year Q3 that were overlapping, that were positive in Q3 last year from a demand standpoint. One was certainly in physical books we had very heavy discounting, which helped our growth in Q3 last year. We're overlapping that in Q3 this year.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets
Thanks Tom.
Tom Szkutak
Thanks Mark.
Operator
Thank you. We'll now go to analyst Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research.
Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research
Hey there and thanks for taking my question. Hoping we can go back to square one here if you don't mind, can you tell us or remind us what financial measures are important to you guys and which financial measures do you hold yourselves and the Board hold you accountable to because it's a little hard to see any of them making positive progress, so I just would love to get back to basics?
Tom Szkutak
Sure, we're looking at a number of different metrics over a long period of time and certainly where our goal is to maximize free cash flow over the long term, we don't focus on individual margins, but we do focus on the inputs that are going to help drive free cash flow and operating income.
We certainly will look at making sure that we're using our capital wisely so that over time we get good returns on invested capital and we certainly have been in several years now of what I would call an investment mode and because of the opportunities that we had in front of us.
And as I mentioned earlier there is still lots of opportunity in front of us and -- but we know that we have to be very selective about which opportunities we pursue and -- but we're encouraged by the opportunities that we have.
Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research
So cash flow and return on invested capital is where we should keep our attention.
Tom Szkutak
Yes.
Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research
Okay. And are the employees in the recruiting side, is that becoming more difficult as the stocks has [faded] [ph] a little bit and those return characteristics have [faded] [ph], how are you making sure that you're hiring the best people?
Tom Szkutak
We have -- we have processes in place to make sure that we have a very high bar on the hiring that we do, the people that we're hiring are extraordinarily talented. We're very fortunate to get to work with so many talented people here and we've been fortunate to be able to grow that employment base to work on the opportunities that we have.
Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research
Thank you.
Tom Szkutak

Thank you. And we'll go to analyst Colin Gillis with BGC Financial.
Colin Gillis - BGC Financial
Great. Thanks for taking my question. So just to get back to that North American media sales, what's the lowest growth rate in over 20 years -- are there – or 20 quarters, are there other factors beyond the text book shifts and sort of the Q3 strength last year? Are the digital media trends still intact?
Tom Szkutak
In terms of the principal drivers -- it's the two that I mentioned. So it's the text books rentals and also overlapping some of the strong discounting and strong titles that we had in some categories. So it's across a number of categories within media, but those are the two principle drivers.
Colin Gillis - BGC Financial
And you don't see this as a broader shift in that number?
Tom Szkutak
No, we're -- there's still both in terms of North America and international, there is certainly a shift that's going on from physical to digital and that's something that we're spending a lot of time on and trying to improve the experience for customers and we've been able to do that certainly over a period of time and so it's something we'll continue to work on.
Colin Gillis - BGC Financial
Okay. Great. Thank you.
Tom Szkutak
Sure.
Operator
Thank you. And we'll continue on to analyst Ron Josey with JMP Securities.
Ron Josey - JMP Securities
Great. Thanks for taking the question. Two please. If you could update us on this rotation center rollout, are all 15 online, and I would love to know maybe how they’ve helped bridge the last mile and improve overall speed delivery.
And then the second question, sort of switching gears and just focusing on advertising, I believe a pilot was launched or beta was launched for Amazon's ad network called CPM Ads I think maybe last August. I am wondering if you can provide some commentary there. Thank you.
Tom Szkutak
Sure, in terms of the sort centers, we'll have over 15 sort centers in the U.S. by the end of the year. It's certainly helping us a lot. We have same day delivery in 12 cities. We'll have Sunday delivery in approximately 50% of the population and so we're pleased to do that.
And in terms of the ad network, there is a not a lot I can say there.
Ron Josey - JMP Securities
Okay. Thank you very much.
Tom Szkutak
Sure.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will come from analyst Aaron Kessler with Raymond James.
Aaron Kessler - Raymond James
Great. Thanks for taking my question. Can you just give us an update maybe on your views on original programming? It looked like Transparents had some good success. Also just from an international standpoint your views or may be the growth in China, India as well, are you seeing any -- signs of any increasing competition in the international, your key international markets today? Thank you.
Tom Szkutak
Sure. In terms of our original content, we're excited about it. We're investing as we talked about. Last quarter we spent approximately $100 million in the quarter. Keep in mind that that's expensed in the quarter and so that's included in the results that you see in Q3.
We're very excited about it. We have a number of pilots as well as a number of series launched. Transparent you mentioned is one of them. It's gotten very good reviews. The streaming on that series has been great. So we're very excited about it and we think it's an interesting area for customers.
We continue to invest heavily in video content including originals and there is a number of different metrics we're looking at certainly from a prime standpoint, but what we're seeing so far are those customers who are streaming are renewing at considerably higher rates at considerably higher rates at a rate that's already high.
So we like what we see there. When customers come in for new trials and they -- free trials and they engage from a video content standpoint, we see the conversion being higher. So we see that we're adding new prime members as a result of that and when those prime members, when those new prime members become prime members, the other thing we're seeing is they're buying physical product, which is a great impact for us.
We see very similar patterns in terms of how much physical product that they're purchasing from us and so we're still certainly in investment mode there, but we like what we see and we have a long way to go there, but we're concentrating on building great service and we see that customers are rewarding us with engagement on the content, both original and licensed and they're buying more from us on the physical side and becoming prime members when they do and have been doing at higher rates.
So those are the some of the early signs and we will continue to monitor very closely, but we're excited about what we're seeing there.
In terms of some of the international comments and I would say this for not just international, but I would say it for the U.S. as well, one thing that's not new is it's a very competitive environment. We have a lot of competitors both online and offline. That's not anything that's new. We used to operate in that environment.
We've been in that environment for really for 19 years and so -- but we're seeing a lot of competition and again that's not new.
Aaron Kessler - Raymond James
Great. Thank you.
Tom Szkutak
Sure.
Operator
Thank you. Our nest question will come from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.
Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs
Great. Thanks. Last quarter you mentioned that the AWS business saw a 90% increase in volume. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of what you’ve seen so far this quarter.
And then in the highlight section of the release, the first six bullet points or so that you have there are all related to the hardware side of the business. if you can just sort of give us now that you have a little bit more time on the hardware side of the business, but behind if you can give us a sense of what you're learning in this category and where you think Amazon's long term position in hardware is ultimately going to be.
Tom Szkutak
In terms of AWS, we're -- we saw a very good growth in Q3 as well. From a usage standpoint it's very similar to Q2, close to 90% and so the team is doing just a fantastic job.
You can see our other revenue in North America went up a little bit sequentially and AWS is certainly the largest piece of that and is the vast majority of it and they're growing at a faster rate than that other line item.
So again the team is doing a fantastic job and not only serving customers, but launching many, many new features and services and you can see some of the detail on that in the Highlight section of our release today. So we're very excited about it.
In terms of devices, I can't speculate what we would do going forward, but we just launched a number of new tablets and e-readers that were excited about and there is some really great price point for customers on the tablet side.
We also launched a kid's tablet which is the first time we've launched. We've launched some new kindles including our premium kindle and it's a terrific product. We think it's the best kindle we've made to date for sure and so we're very excited about that. And we're excited to have these offerings for customers.
Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs
Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. We'll continue on to analyst Ben Schachter with Macquarie Equities Research.
Ben Schachter - Macquarie
Hi Tom. You mentioned that you need to get leverage at some point. In the last call you also said something similar, but can you help us quantify the timing that in your internal modeling when do you expect to see more meaningful leverage and when you look at your three to five year's outlook, what does your leverage picture look like there and then also can you remind us of what your philosophy of stock buybacks is and what would it take to get you back in the market, thanks?
Tom Szkutak
In terms of leverage, beyond the guidance that we're giving today, there is not a lot of certainly I can give you, but again what I had mentioned earlier is we do have a lot of opportunities, but our job is to be judicious and selective about what opportunities we pursue.
And so that's the way we're thinking about it and I apologize I can't give you any more certainty in terms of timing, but certainly that's the way we're thinking about it.
And in terms of buybacks, we haven’t opened buybacks right now. We have authorization to do that. I certainly can't comment on what price points we would or wouldn’t do there.
Operator
Thank you. We'll continue on to analyst Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch
Great. Thank you. If you look at the phone impact in Q3, it seems to explain some of the difference versus the Street, but when you look forward to Q4, it looks like you’re guiding to about 15% to 16% growth ex FX and again profits maybe below some expectations.
Is the phone having an impact on profits in Q4 as well? And also when you think about the Q4 guidance are there any events or things you want to call out? Are you being especially conservative in Q4 giving recent trends? Anything different this year on holiday? Thank you.
Tom Szkutak
Yes. In terms of the holiday season just and if you look back the last several years, I've been giving wide ranges because it’s again a more seasonal quarter, always challenging to predict precisely where we're going to be. So in terms of a dollar range I gave us $3 billion range last year.
I am giving a $3 billion range again this year from a revenue perspective again wide range. At the higher end of the range, excluding foreign exchange, it's approximately 21%. So it's a little bit higher than what we saw in Q3 and then you can see we're on the low end of the range.
In terms of -- but in terms of the season itself, we're very excited about it. And in terms of to serve customers, we feel great about the selection that we have added and are continuing to add for the holiday season.
We think from an operations standpoint each year we try to get better and we believe we'll be even better this year than we have had in previous years. And so we are super excited to serve customers.
In terms of the phone, the only other thing that I can comment on is at the end of Q3, we had approximately $83 million worth of inventory on hand. And so I can't comment on how that would impact guidance or not, but that's the amount of inventory we had on hand at the end of Q3.
Justin Post - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch
Thank you.
Tom Szkutak
Sure.
Operator
Thank you. Our next analyst will be John Blackledge with Cowen & Company.
John Blackledge - Cowen & Company
Great. Thanks. Just a couple of questions. We saw that Amazon Fresh expanded into Brooklyn recently. Just wondering if we can discuss your decision to expand into New York City and how we should think about timings for expansion into other markets and then if you can update us on the number of fulfillment centers globally and in the year that would be great. Thank you.
Tom Szkutak
Sure, in terms of the number of fulfillment centers it's 13 net for the year and then on as I mentioned earlier in the U.S. we'll have 15 sort centers by the end of more than 14, excuse me, more than 15 sort centers by the end of the year.
In terms of, sorry the other part of the question was on Fresh, the team is doing a great job from a customer experience standpoint. As you can see we're in a few cities. Today, the team is just heads down focused on making sure that experience is great for customers. We continue -- customers like the service.
So we're seeing good pick up there and as you mentioned, we're expanding in the Brooklyn. I can't speculate on what we do beyond the cities that we have launched today, but we're excited about what we're seeing so far there.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will come from analyst Eric Sheridan with UBS.
Eric Sheridan - UBS
Thanks for taking the question. Tom you guys put thorough a price increase on the prime services here. Was curious what you were seeing in terms of the impact of that price increase on both the rate of adding people into Prime and the ability to control churn inside the Prime subscription base in general.
And as you add additional functionality and layers into Prime like you’ve done this year through the investments, whether you’ve thought about maybe put in another price increase through next year. Thanks.
Tom Szkutak
In terms of what we do going forward it certainly wouldn’t speculate. We had a price point since our initiation of, excuse me, since the launch of Prime. Its $79 and so it took us long time and we were very careful with that to increase it to $99.
But since we've increased to $99 we've had -- we've had great retention. We're very pleased with the -- the retention we've had from customers. The program is growing very fast. We're very excited about it and so we do think it's really good for customers and it’s really good for us and shareowners over the long term.
You're correct in that we're investing in Prime in a number of different ways including video content as I talked about earlier that is certainly the way we'll get a return on that investment. Principally will be customers buying more including and especially physical products.
So again we're very excited about Prime globally.
Operator
Thank you. Our next analyst will be Brian Nowak with SIG.
Brian Nowak - SIG
Thanks for taking my questions. I have two please. The first one, fulfillment ex stock based comp was the highest it's ever been as a percentage of gross profit in the third quarter, can you just talk about the drivers of that? Is that for rotations centers or international growth, what's driving that?
And then as we think about this rotation centers, what's the impact of those over the next few quarters to fulfillment? Are they do they take a while to kind of get the inefficiencies out of the system like a standard DC would?
Tom Szkutak
Yes, in terms of fulfillment cost, you're right. Again we're adding 13 net fulfillment centers where we added -- we'll have over 15 sort centers at the end of the year. certainly one of the drivers for that is certainly the growth that we are experiencing, but in addition to that, what we're seeing is the FBA adoption continues to get better and if we get further penetrated with sellers adopting full by Amazon, we think that's really good for sellers and for us and for customers over the long term.
And what you're seeing is we're several years ago in terms of performance center planning we were adding less of them and it was much closer to the holiday season. With the sheer amount of capacity that we're adding, you're seeing more of that come in even before Q4.
So you're seeing that impacting us earlier and the benefit of coming in earlier is we get to serve customer and get up to the productivity rates that we want to, to serve customers in Q4, by having that capacity in a bit earlier than in the past.
So you’ve seen that trend happen over the past few years with that coming in earlier than certainly historically we've been able to do.
Brian Nowak - SIG
Okay. Great. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next analyst will be Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo.
Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo
Thanks so much for taking my questions. First Prime launched a referral fee recently and I am wondering if we should take that as any indication that the membership growth has slowed or you're seeing some higher churn and how does that referral fee get accounted for.
And then secondly, Target launched free shipping with no hurdle for the holidays versus your $35 hurdle, I am just wondering what your willingness is to leave that competitive gap during the holidays, thanks.
Tom Szkutak
Yes, can't comment from a competitive standpoint what we might or might do there, but in terms of the Prime referral fee, no, you should not read into that that Prime isn’t growing well and in fact just the opposite.
We’re seeing great growth and we like the fact that enabling customers because they like Prime to be able to refer others we think is great for us and so I can't actually maybe offline you can follow-up with Phil or Dave on the accounting. Top of my head, I can't remember how that's working, but I know they will be able to answer it for you.
Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo
Okay. Thanks so much.
Operator
Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, our final question will come from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird.
Colin Sebastian - Robert W. Baird
Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. A couple of follow-ups. First off in terms of the Q4 revenue guide, are you giving any consideration to that forecast to some of the shipping issues that happened last holiday and the ability of your shipping partners to manage your growth.
And then secondly on paid units, can you provide a splits or color between physical and digital unit growth. Thanks.
Tom Szkutak
In terms of -- in terms of the guidance it reflects all of the assumptions that we think could happen for the quarter. So again it's a wide range to speak specifically to some of the issues last year. The team again -- we continue trying to learn from everything that we do and the team has done a great job learning from our experiences, coming out of Q4 last year as we do every year and are excited to serve customers.
In terms of the unit growth, there is not I can add in terms of split other than the overall -- other than the overall growth rate, but we are -- we are pleased with certainly we're seeing good customer growth, sellers are -- we're doing we think a great job for sellers. We continue to add a lot of unique selection throughout the year in terms of and we have customers.
We see FBA four sellers getting further, further penetrated. We've launched some interest in products for our customers. We think our web services team is doing a great job.
We realize that we have a lot of opportunities, but we need to be selective on which opportunities we pursue and I think beyond that, we're just overall excited and again ready for the holiday season.
So anyway thanks everybody for calling in today.

Good day and welcome to the Amazon.com Q2 2014 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Also, today's call is being recorded.
For opening remarks, I'll be turning the conference over to the Director of Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please go ahead, sir.
Phil Hardin
Hello and welcome to our Q2 2014 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 24, 2014 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.
During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2013.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom.
Tom Szkutak
Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our second quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 18% to $5.33 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $1.04 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.29 billion. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth consisting of additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations and investments in technology infrastructure including Amazon Web Services.
Return on invested capital was 6%, up from 2%, ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter-ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 480 million shares compared with 474 million one year ago.
Worldwide revenue grew 23% to $19.34 billion or 22% excluding the $237 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. Media revenue increased to $4.84 billion, up 10% or 9% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $13.28 billion, up 27% or 26% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 69% of worldwide sales, up from 66%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 23%. Active customer accounts exceeded 250 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 41% of paid units.
Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $13.4 billion or 69.3% of revenue compared with 71.4%. Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content and G&A combined was $5.54 billion or 28.6% of sales, up approximately 260 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $2.28 billion or 11.8% of revenue compared with 11.2%. Tech and content was $2.02 billion or 10.4% of revenue compared with 9.1%. Marketing was $911 million or 4.7% of revenue compared with 4.1%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results. And consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 26% to $12 billion. Media revenue grew 13% to $2.46 billion or 14% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 29% to $8.37 billion, representing 70% of North America revenues, up from 68%. Other revenue grew 38% to $1.17 billion. North America segment operating income increased 7% to $438 million, a 3.7% operating margin.
In the international segment, revenue grew 18% to $7.34 billion. Excluding the $246 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 14%. Media revenue grew 7% to $2.38 billion or 4% excluding foreign exchange, and EGM revenue grew 25% to $4.91 billion or 20% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 67% of international revenues, up from 63%. International segment operating loss was $34 million compared to zero in the prior period.
CSOI decreased 1% to $404 million or 2.1% of revenue, down approximately 50 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange rate, CSOI decreased 9%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income or loss includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating loss was $15 million compared to operating income of $79 million in the prior-year period. Our income tax expense was $94 million, and this includes approximately $90 million of discrete tax items primarily attributable to audit-related developments. GAAP net loss was $126 million or $0.27 per diluted share compared with a net loss of $7 million and $0.02 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $523 million year-over-year to $7.99 billion. Inventory increased 23% to $6.64 billion, and inventory turns were 9.1, down from 9.4 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 16% to $10.46 billion and accounts payable days decreased to 71 from 73 in the prior year.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.
For Q3 2014, we expect net sales of between $19.7 billion and $21.5 billion or growth of between 15% and 26%. This guidance anticipates approximately 120 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating loss to be between $810 million loss and a $410 million loss compared to a $25 million loss in the third quarter of 2013. This includes approximately $410 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $400 million loss and zero compared to $267 million of income in the third quarter of 2013.
We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move to questions.
Phil Hardin
Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) We'll hear first today from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein.
Carlos Kirjner - Bernstein
Tom, you mentioned in the past that China is an area of investments. Can you say a little bit about what are the main drivers of investment there, whether it's marketing pricing fulfillment? And how do you decide on any given year how much we invest in China, just given the size of the potential market and opportunity? And secondly, we saw a material deceleration in the North America other revenues. Was this primarily driven by AWS deceleration, and is this deceleration a meaningful contributor to the losses implied in your next quarter guidance?
Tom Szkutak
Yes, North America other includes a number of things including Amazon Web Services. Amazon Web Services is the largest part of North America other. As we talked about on last call, we had very substantial price reductions for customers starting in second quarter. They ranged from 28% to 51% depending on the service. But AWS continues to grow very strongly. In Q2, we had usage growth close to 90% year-over-year for the quarter. So the team is doing a fantastic job. And we put in some price reductions that were very substantial that are saving customers hundreds and millions of dollars over the next several months, as we mentioned 90 days ago.
But again, we love that business. It's doing great and we're very pleased to have the opportunity to invest in it. The team is innovating very quickly. In fact, so far year-to-date, they've released 250 significant service and features and that's at a pace that's much, much faster than last year's pace, which was faster than the year before. So again, they're continuing to innovate on behalf of customers. And so we're investing. And so that's certainly impacting both the pricing decisions we've made. They're certainly impacting the guidance. Also, the large amount of CapEx in infrastructure for that business is certainly impacting the guidance along with a number of other things across the business that we're investing in. But we're very pleased to do that.
In terms of China, we're continuing to invest on behalf of customers there, obviously trying to make the experience even better for customers in terms of improved in-stock levels. We've certainly added a lot of fulfillment capacity over time in China, and we're doing a lot of interesting things to better serve customers in China.
In terms of some of the other parts of your question, there's not much more I can add to that.
Operator
We'll hear next from Neil Doshi with CRT Capital.
Neil Doshi - CRT Capital
Tom, can you talk a little bit about the deceleration in the units? And then also, in terms of the third-party dollar, it looks like you're trending around 40%. For a while, it ticked up a little bit to 41%. And so if we adjust for digital, how should that trend be looking?
Tom Szkutak
In terms of unit growth, we had 23% unit growth year-over-year. It is down from last year's growth rate, but it's consistent with what we've seen recently including the last quarter. And in terms of the third-party units as a percentage of total units, you're right that's 41% this quarter. It's up about 100 basis points. And we're not breaking out the digital versus physical on that. But again, very strong third-party growth, a number of factors, but certainly FBA is helping third-party growth.
Operator
And we'll go next to Eric Sheridan with UBS.
Eric Sheridan - UBS
Looking through the expense lines, tech and content seem to have an upward pressure in the quarter. Why don't you maybe give a little more granularity on what was driving that upward pressure and whether that's sort of a new run rate of expense as we saw in the first half of this year?
Tom Szkutak
There's a number of things that are going into the tech and content line. But you're right we're the ones that I just mentioned, we are investing in various parts of the business, but certainly for Amazon Web Services, that's both from an infrastructure standpoint to support the very fast usage growth that we're experiencing. Again, we have usage growth close to 90% year-over-year in the second quarter for Web Services. In addition to that, over the past year, we've added thousands of people in Web Services. So again, ramping that up. And then across a number of different other investment areas, we continue to add great technical resources to do the things we're doing in digital and many other parts of the company. So again, we have a lot of opportunities to invest in, as you can see from a lot of the releases that we've had over the past 12 months, and you're certainly seeing that reflected in our actual results as well.
Operator
And next from JPMorgan, we'll go to Douglas Anmuth.
Kaizad Gotla - JPMorgan
This is Kaizad Gotla for Doug. I was wondering if you could just talk about the deceleration in your international EGM line. And then separately, now that you've had Prime price increases in effect for about three months, wondering if you could just talk about any changes you've seen in sign-ups or conversions there.
Tom Szkutak
In terms of international EGM, and this would really related to total international growth as well, we saw 18% growth on a dollar basis, 14% growth on a local currency growth basis. We're just down a little bit sequentially from what we saw in Q1. Obviously there's variability from quarter-to-quarter in each of the geographies that we operate in. One call-out which impacted certainly EGM and our total international growth rate is Japan. We saw on April 1st, the consumption tax was increased from 5% to 8%.
Leading up to that in the latter part of Q1, we certainly saw accelerated growth, so that was reflected in the Q1 results. In Q2, we saw some corresponding softness in Q2 following that. Hard to know how much was related to consumption growth, but certainly as you've probably read elsewhere that others are seeing that too. So it probably reflects the consumption tax increase. But if you take out Japan out of both Q1 and Q2, the growth rates on a local currency basis were very similar within approximately 100 basis points of each other.
In terms of Prime, Prime subscribers are growing very nicely year-over-year. In fact, we had more Prime subscribers in Q2 of this year than in Q2 of last year. So we're very pleased and we continue to get new subscribers as well as existing customers responding to the great value they're getting out of Prime.
Operator
And from Citi, we'll go to Mark May.
Mark May - Citi
Based on sort of what you've talked about in the disclosures around the price, the amount of the price decreases, the common sense would suggest that all if not most of the CSOI margin decline that you posted in Q2 year-on-year is related to the AWS price changes. And the common sense would also suggest that given the significant volume gains that you're seeing in that business that Q2 might be the most impacted quarter from that yet. The third quarter guidance suggests that it's having an even greater impact on Q3. Just wondering if you could help us think through that. Is there some timing issue related to the impact of that, or is there something else going on within the core retail business or maybe some other one-time items that might be impacting your Q3 outlook?
Tom Szkutak
We're not quantifying the impact of the price changes on our Q2 and Q3, but it is fair to say that it certainly did impact our Q2 results in a meaningful way. And that's reflected in the results that you're seeing. Another thing to keep in mind as you look out related to AWS is we're continuing to invest in that business. And with the great strong usage growth rates that we're seeing, we're also investing in CapEx and infrastructure to support that growth. So again, the team has done a fantastic job innovating on behalf of customers. And as I mentioned earlier, the new releases both from a service and feature perspective was about 250 year-to-date, which is at a pace that's much faster than we've seen over the last few years with very high bar, given all the innovation that's happened from that team in that space.
So again, there are certainly things that are impacting Q3 guidance. There's a number of other things. When you look at Q3, keep in mind if you look back over the last several years, we're getting ready for Q4 seasonal quarter. And when that happens, if you look back, certainly you've seen our CSOI usually has been at the lowest point for the year during Q3, particularly during these high growth years. And so we've announced that we're adding six net new fulfillment centers. And we've also announced that we'll have 15 or more sortation centers. The sortation centers help us get closer to customers, so that we can have fastest delivery speed as well as deliver on Sundays, which is a big deal for us in the US. So we're very pleased to be able to do that.
On top of that, other investment areas that are certainly impacting our Q3 guidance is we like what we see on the content side. So video content, for example, we're ramping up the spend from Q2 to Q3 significantly. And so it'll be also a significant growth year-over-year. Keep in mind we have two types of content. We have license content. We also have original content. A lot of you have probably seen a lot of the announcements that we've green-lighted a number of pilots. We're going to be in heavy production in those series that have been green-lit during Q3. We've also announced a number of pilots that will be in production on. And so that original content, it's a portion of our total content, will be over $100 million in Q3.
Just as a reminder, we do not capitalize that portion of our original content. Its expense is incurred. So that's over $100 million in Q3. And again, that's ramped up considerably both on a sequential and on a year-over-year basis.
Other areas that we're investing in, certainly with the launch of some new devices more recently over the past couple of quarters between Fire Phone and Fire TV and others, over time we've invested in devices. So that's certainly an area we're investing in. We're investing in a lot of different areas including geographic expansion. We talked about China on one of the earlier questions. But certainly India, we're investing very heavily. We're seeing some very positive results there. The team is doing a fantastic job. We're also investing in other geographies as well, Italy and Spain and others. So again, we're encouraged by just the sheer magnitude of opportunities we have and we're investing in those opportunities.
Operator
We'll move next to Brian Pitz with Jefferies.
Brian Pitz - Jefferies
First question on FBA. Any insights on the penetration of third-party sellers using FBA. Maybe you could comment just directionally? Is the number trending up or down? And separately, it's been less than a week, but can you comment on early feedback to Kindle Unlimited by customers and publishers? Do you expect this to be the model for digital book consumption in the future?
Tom Szkutak
In terms of FBA, it's doing great. I can't provide a specific percent. But it's really since the time we've launched continued to increase as a percentage of total third-party units. And so the service has done very well. The team continues to work on making it even better on behalf of sellers and customers.
In terms of Kindle Unlimited, it's very early, but we're extremely pleased with what we see. There's been a great reaction to it. And we're pleased to offer that to customers.
Operator
Moving next to Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.
Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs
You mentioned that you were happy with the results that you're seeing from the video content. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of sort of how that manifests itself, whether it's more Prime subscribers, whether it's more consumption of downloadable video content within the ecosystem. And then, Tom, to the extent that you're talking about sort of AWS volume increases on a year-over-year basis, can you give us a sense of how that may have trended over the course of the quarter as your AWS customers were able to sort of adapt to the price reduction in March?
Tom Szkutak
In terms of content, we've seen just more and more customers are streaming, more and more Prime members are streaming free content. We're seeing through our pipeline as customers join Prime, we're seeing that we have more and more customers taking free trials and then converting. Those customers are great customers. In addition to streaming free content, they have great purchasing patterns, doing a lot of cross-shopping on physical products as well as converting to paid digital video and other digital products as well. So we're very pleased with what we're seeing there. And when you look at the service that we have today, it's improved dramatically over the past 12 to 24 months. And we really think it's a great service and that's why we're investing in it.
In terms of AWS, there's not much I can help you with on that. But again, just to reiterate, we saw very strong growth during Q2 with usage growth rates close to 90% year-over-year for the quarter. And we're extremely happy with what we see there, and the team has done a fantastic job, continue to innovate on behalf of customers.
Operator
We'll hear next from John Blackledge with Cowen & Company.
John Blackledge - Cowen & Company
Just a couple of question, first on AWS. Just wondering your take on the competitive environment in public cloud, has it intensified over the past six to 12 months, just given the investments in AWS? How do you view AWS's competitive positioning? And then if you could just touch on the key drivers of EGM growth in North America, and are those the same drivers of growth internationally or are there different drivers North America versus international?
Tom Szkutak
They work hard to be able to afford lower prices for customers. That's something that is instilled in all of Amazon and something certainly is instilled in our Web Services team. And their folks on what they do best, which is innovating on behalf of customers, operating these services at the highest quality levels, and they continue to work on getting more efficient, so that we can have great prices for customers. And so that's a team that's focused and they're doing a great job.
In terms of EGM growth between North America and international, there's not a lot I can call out there. It has many different categories across many different geographies, many different ASINs both first party and third party. So it's hard to comment. The only thing I would call for attention is the comment I made earlier around international growth rates related to EGM, and that was the consumption tax increase in Japan that we saw a lead in Q1 where we saw very strong growth leading up to that point and it softened after the rates went into effect. But other than that, there's not a lot to call out.
Operator
We'll now go to Macquarie's Ben Schachter.
Ben Schachter - Macquarie
When you mentioned that AWS is growing 90% year-over-year, what exactly is growing 90%? Is it storage? Is it something else? And then on the phone itself, are there any key differences in how we should be thinking about that piece of hardware versus other hardware you've done in the past where Jeff has discussed the notion of potentially one to breakeven? And then just a follow-up on that. How are you modeling the impact of the phone on the P&L in 3Q? Is it going to be more or less than the original content initiative?
Tom Szkutak
In terms of AWS, it's really aggregation of usage across all of our services year-over-year. Think of it as almost a proxy similar to unit growth on our retail business. It's a proxy to say how fast the physical volume is growing. And so that's what it's a proxy for.
In terms of the phone, there's not a lot I can help you with on that. We're extremely pleased to get it in customers' hands. We think it's a premium product. You get a 32 gigabyte phone, premium product, one-year free subscription to Prime along with all the other features that I'm sure you've read about. So again, we're very pleased to get it to customers and start shipping. And customers have started to receive those today.
Operator
And from William Blair, we'll go to Mark Miller.
Mark Miller - William Blair
Many investments, it looks like where you are getting a return is in the gross margin. If I take out AWS, it looks like you're up nearly 200 basis points. What are the drivers of that e-commerce margin increase? Are you seeing it primarily on the first-party margin expansion? And if so, why? And how much is coming from third-party unit increase?
Tom Szkutak
We don't actually focus on total company gross margins because of the mix of the business. We focus more on operating profit and obviously ultimately free cash flow dollars. But in terms of things that would be impacting COGS as a percentage of revenue and that change, to be helpful, you mentioned AWS is certainly having an impact there. Our third-party business continues to have an impact there. We have offsets as we lower prices to customers, having an impact there. Just mix of various products and geographies has an impact on those results. Again, a large number of items that are impacting that.
Operator
And Justin Post with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch has our next question.
Justin Post - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch
Tom, there might be a little bit of a disconnect. When we see prior investment cycles such as distribution builds out or devices with, say, the Kindle reader, we did see an impact on units and accelerating growth in some of the categories. This time around, even investing for a couple of years and I guess we're not really seeing the acceleration. So maybe you could talk about what gives you confidence in investing in devices like the Fire TV and the phone and all the content you're doing? And are you seeing some underlying signs, let's say, activities picking up? Maybe you could walk through that.
Tom Szkutak
Just a couple of things to call out. One is when we look at our unit growth, you hear the 23% unit growth, keep in mind that there're parts of our business that are not included in that unit growth. So when we talk about investing in Web Services and the usage growing close to 90%, that number is not included in the 23%. So that's obviously a large investment area for us that we're excited about that is not included in that.
The other is think about the base of business that we have versus where we were just a few years ago. And so you've seen very strong growth on the base that we have. And we're excited to see that. When we look at the opportunities that we're investing in, in terms of video, you mentioned, we're seeing that certainly in the number of Prime members that are subscribing. And so that has some short-term impact, the great long-term impact as we retain those Prime members and as they start to do more cross-shopping over time. We have a lot of investment in front of that demand, if you will. So those are some of the things that I would call out to be try to be helpful.
Operator
We'll move now to Youssef Squali with Cantor Fitzgerald.
Youssef Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald
Going back to $100 million spend on the original content, you mentioned earlier as that part of the business grows, is there any reason to believe that the amount of spend on the originals will go down? The assumption here is it'll only go up. So is that $100 million a good level to work off of? And then going back to the Fire Phone, just trying to understand the strategy around the product longer term. Is it again just to try to further build the Amazon ecosystem with all the benefits or do you think this could be a cell phone of the business?
Tom Szkutak
In terms of the original content, we're not giving guidance on the numbers going forward and beyond Q3. We're very excited about what we see and the pilots we had and the series we had. And so we're very happy to green-light the series that we've talked about and released over the past few months. We're also happy you'll be seeing many new pilots. And so that's reflected in the over $100 million that I mentioned earlier. So we're extremely excited on behalf of customers to be able to do that, and we think that's a great thing to do. But in terms of what we do in terms of spend beyond Q3, can't comment on today.
In terms of the Fire Phone, we're very excited about it. You mentioned two different areas. One is can it exist on its own and whether it's part of our family, if you will, to help drive other usage. And the answer is we certainly think it can be both. So we think it could be a great product on its own. We're very excited to offer it to customers. It's very integrated into our various digital services including video and games and our app store and ebooks and certainly Prime music. So those are all very interesting things on behalf of customers. It's also a great way to do physical shopping as well. So again, it's certainly integrated into our business as well.
Operator
And Brian Nowak with SIG has our next question.
Brian Nowak - SIG
The first one is around CPG, consumer packaged goods, I was wondering, Tom, can you talk to us some learnings in CPG so far, what's working and what you think is still holding back faster CPG adoption? Do you think you need a same-day delivering offering at this point for CPG kind of given Google and even the traditional retailers push into that category? And then the second one, the close to 90% AWS usage growth, just help us understand a bit more, what did that number look like in 2013?
Tom Szkutak
Yeah, in terms of the usage growth, the business is growing very, very fast beyond the data point. There's not a lot I can help you with. In terms of CPG, and this really relates to many of our categories, we're working on behalf of customers to provide fast delivery. It's something that we've improved on over the years and we're going to continue to work on. There's a number of different things we're working on. One of the things that I mentioned early in the call is certainly sortation centers. That's an attempt on our side. We have in a small way and tested it and we've seen that it's a way to get product to customers even faster. So we're excited about that. It also helps deliver on Sunday, which we think is great too. So again, those are the things that we're working on as well as others to help customers get product faster. And we think that benefits CPG products as well other products.
Operator
We'll move next to Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets
I wanted to follow up on that William Blair question about gross margins only because I know you don't focus on and there're a lot of mix factors that you correctly pointed out. But that's a record high gross margin for you, 30.7%, ever. And it's in the context of a quarter in which AWS clearly came in because of the price cuts. And so there's something else that happened there that really caused that gross margin to gap up. Could you give us any color? I understand there're a lot of puts and takes in there. But something must have happened that was unusual to have that kind of result with a slowing down AWS contribution.
Tom Szkutak
We don't focus a lot on gross margin of the business. Obviously unusual product lines, we would look at gross margin. But across the business, we don't for the very reason you mentioned. There's a large mix impact. You have our Web Services business. You have our third-party business. You have the retail business. You have categories within retail. There's a whole host of things that would impact that. And so that's why we don't focus on a total company basis. Certainly on individual SKUs or ASINs, as we call them, we certainly would look at it. Individual sub-categories, we would certainly look at it internally. But from a total company perspective, given the mix effects, we think it's much more appropriate to look at operating profit and free cash flow.
Operator
And from ISI Group, we'll go to Greg Melich.
Greg Melich - ISI Group
Looked like revenue per active customer accelerated again this quarter, up over 5%. It was running closer to 2% to 3% last year. Could you help us understand what's driving that, whether it's Prime particularly, or any color on that? And when you gave the Prime numbers second quarter more sign-ups whether that was a grosser in that number?
Tom Szkutak
The Prime, it was a net number. So that's the net additions to total members. So again, we added net more Prime members in Q2 of this year versus Q2 last year, even with the price change. In terms of revenue per active customer, there's not a lot I can say there. A few things to think about, one is certainly Prime customers buy more than non-Prime customers. And we're seeing great growth on Prime. That's certainly having an impact on that number. And certainly there'll be other factors too. Our Web Services business would be included in the numerator that you're talking about as well. And so those are factors you should be thinking about. But again, the biggest factor would certainly be in terms of looking at our retail business, Prime is becoming much more meaningful. And that's also why we think about how do we make Prime better on behalf of those customers. We just like the long-term benefits that we see for those customers.
Operator
And our final question today will be from Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird & Company.
Colin Sebastian - Robert Baird & Company
One of your executives in the UK recently mentioned the company's goal of reaching 1 billion different products available for sale on the site. I wonder if there is an expansion in selection beyond what we've seen recently that could help accelerate growth. And related to that, are you still relatively agnostic in terms of the split between first and third-party unit sales?
Tom Szkutak
In terms of selection, I would say nothing is new here. We're going to continue to add unique selection. That's something that we've been working extremely hard day-in and day-out over many years. We have a great team of people working on that and trying to make sure we get a vast selection. So that's something that we're pleased about. In terms of the margins, they do approximate each other. Obviously there's some differences. Some of the third-party will be used products. And you shouldn't assume that a used product necessarily has the same contribution profit per unit as a new unit, things like that. But they're close approximates of those.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q1 2014 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. In addition, today’s conference is being recorded.
And now for opening remarks, I will turn the conference over to Senior Manager of Investor Relations, Mr. Dave Fildes. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Fildes

Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2014 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management’s views as of today, April 24, 2014 only and will include forward-looking statements.
Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today’s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.
As you listen to today’s conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.
During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2013.
Now, I’ll turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas J. Szkutak

Thanks, Dave. I’ll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 26% to $5.35 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $1.49 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $3.85 billion.
We continue to make additional investments in support of business growth consisting of investments and technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
Return on invested capital is 9%, up from 1%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 476 million shares compared with 471 million one year ago.
Worldwide revenue grew 23% to $19.74 billion or 23% excluding the $10 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Media revenue increased to $5.47 billion, up 8% or 8% excluding foreign exchange.
EGM revenue increased to $13.02 billion, up 27% or 27% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 66% of worldwide sales, up from 64%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 23%. Active customer accounts exceeded 244 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 40% of paid units.
Now I’ll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $14.06 billion or 71.2% of revenue, compared with 73.4%. Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content and G&A combined was $5.18 billion or 26.2% of sales, up approximately 240 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $2.24 billion or 11.3% of revenue, compared with 10.8%. Tech and content was $1.82 billion or 9.2% of revenue, compared with 7.9%. Marketing was $843 million or 4.3% of revenue, compared with 3.8%.
Now I’ll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 26% to $11.86 billion. Media revenue grew 12% to $2.82 billion or 13% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 28% to $7.83 billion, representing 66% of North America revenues, up from 65%. Other revenue grew 60% to $1.2 billion. North America segment operating income increased 23% to $562 million, a 4.7% operating margin.
In the International segment, revenue grew 18% to $7.88 billion. Adjusting for the $24 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 18%.
Media revenue grew 4% to $2.64 billion, or 4% excluding foreign exchange and EGM revenue grew 27% to $5.19 billion or 26% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 66% of International revenues, up from 61%. International segment operating loss was $60 million, compared with $16 million loss in the prior period.
CSOI increased 14% to $502 million or 2.5% of revenue, down approximately 20 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI increased 10%.
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 19% to $146 million or 0.7% of net sales.
Our income tax expense was $73 million. GAAP net income was $108 million or $0.23 per diluted share, compared with $82 million and $0.18 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $771 million year-over-year to $8.67 billion. Inventory increased 24% to $6.72 billion and inventory turns were 9.1, down from 9.5 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories.
Accounts payable increased 19% to $10.59 billion and accounts payable days were 68 consistent with the prior year.
I’ll conclude my portion of today’s call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we’ve seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It’s not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance.
Our guidance further assumes that we don’t conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.
For Q2 2014, we expect net sales of between $18.1 billion and $19.8 billion or growth of between 15% and 26%. This guidance anticipates approximately 160 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between $455 million loss and $55 million loss, compared to $79 million in income in the second quarter of 2013. This includes approximately $455 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between zero and $400 million, compared to $409 million in the second quarter of 2013.
We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
Thanks. With that, Dave, let’s move to questions.
Dave Fildes
Thanks, Tom. Let’s move onto the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?
Question-and-Answer Session

Operator
Absolutely, Mr. Fildes. (Operator Instructions) We’ll hear first from Mark Miller with William Blair.
Mark R. Miller – William Blair & Co. LLC

Hi Tom. I was hoping you could maybe just layout first, what do you think the main reasons are for the acceleration and growth here in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter. And then a specific question on Prime Pantry, it is one of motivations to get the customer on that program it might make get easier to convert them to Amazon Fresh. And if so, would you want to run this operation as a breakeven like you do with Kindle, to enable a bigger business, thanks.
Thomas J. Szkutak

In terms of growth, we saw very solid growth, very good growth in Q1, up 23% on a local currency basis. North-America we saw a similar growth rates in Q1 as we saw in Q4 of last year as well as Q1 of last year all at 26%. And then international we saw the growth accelerate a little bit on a exchange adjusted basis from 15% to 18% from Q4 to Q1. But we really seen is we are pleased with the overall fundamentals we continue to add new customers and stocks continues to be healthy, third party unit is a percentage of units are above 40% still very strong FBA adoption, that continues to be strong around the world, continued to add new selection.
We saw strong growth in many different areas including Web Services, and so again a lot of different areas contributed to growth rate that we saw in Q1. In terms of Prime Pantry, we just think it’s an exciting option for prime numbers that’s available only to prime numbers, and so they can get their everyday non-bulk items in one box, and we think that’s – its’ interesting for customers and again it’s great way that we can add the selection and have the selections for those customers.
Operator
Moving on to Aram Robinson with Wolfe Research.
Aram H. Rubinson – Wolfe Research LLC
Hi, thanks for taking the question. On the famous drone interview that Jeff had with Charlie Rose, he said something that caught my attention, which was that every elasticity study that you do says that Amazon should be raising prices. I have two questions around that. The first is does that equation also work in reverse? Meaning that if higher questions don’t dampen demand, does it also mean that lower prices don’t stimulate demand like they used to?
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of pricing, we’ve been very consistent. We want to offer great value to customers, and so I would work very hard to make sure that we can offer and afford to offer great prices for customers. And so, that’s something that we’ve been working on in the very hard over the years and that’s certainly one of the reason why you’ve seen the growth rates that we’ve experienced a long with getting close to customers, from the shipping perspective make sure we have great in stocks and other service attributes.
In terms of price increases, we certainly have increased the price on Prime, but again that was after many years of not raising the price even though the cost of transportation costs certainly had gone up and the fact that we have certainly added a lot of selection going from little over 1 million items in the first year to over 20 million items. So it’s still an incredibly great value for customers and that’s why we did that.
So again, we’re all about making sure we have great values for customers and we’ll continue to that.
Aram H. Rubinson – Wolfe Research LLC
Okay thanks for that.
Operator
Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein has the next question.
Carlos Kirjner – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Hi, thank you. I have two quick questions about AWS. First, I think everyone would agree that AWS is a vast opportunity. So given how large the opportunity is, why is it that you are not hiring more people, launching more products, and growing faster? What are the limiting factors for growth of AWS?
Second, you have a long history of cutting prices for a few specific AWS products, but you did something somewhat unusual in late March when you cut prices across EC2 and S3 products in one shot. Why did you only cut your prices after Google cut theirs? Thank you.
Thomas J. Szkutak

 In terms of AWS, the team is doing a fantastic job. We are adding a lot of resources that we’ve grown our employee-based there dramatically over the years and continue to add people there. And that’s the way we’ve been able to launch all the new services that we had over the past several years. And we continued the pace of acceleration in terms of new things that we’re doing is increasing and we’ve published a lot of statistics around that.
In terms of pricing, we think this is our 42nd pricing increase that we had in AWS. Sorry price decrease in AWS and we’re very excited behalf of customers to be able to do that. The team works very hard to able to afford those lower prices and we’re excited to do that. And so in terms of the timing of when we launched these price decreases, they come at different times and that happened to come in the presentation that we’re giving around that time. So but again we’re excited about the opportunity and we’re continuing invest in that business, given the big opportunity that we have there.
Operator
Our next question will come from Ben Schachter with Macquarie.
Ben Schachter – Macquarie Capital, Inc.

Can you walk us through the process on how you think about and how you model, how much you’re willing to pay for exclusive content such as video or video game content. And another question, it looks fair for us to assume that the business model of the Kindle Fire TV is similar to what Bezos has said regarding selling other hardware roughly break even and then making money on the F consumer unit. Thanks.
Thomas J. Szkutak

In terms of video content, the team does a very nice job of various modeling, certainly we are trying to estimate what the usages of those of all the content that we’ve launched. And we have a number of different ways if you do that. We do have certainly for some of the content that we have been selling both in terms of physical format as well as selling on the transactional side. We certainly see what the – what those sales are, what those unit sales are. So we have that as a benchmark, we also have other models to look at that to help us guide to we think the usage that will be those.
But again the team has done a nice job and I am looking at different ways to model that. And I expect it will continue to refine that overtime as well.
Ben Schachter – Macquarie Capital, Inc.
And the Kindle Fire TV.
Thomas J. Szkutak
Yes, in terms of Fire TV, I can’t talk about the economics of the device itself. But what I can say is it’s very early and we are extremely pleased with what see and just the few weeks here and the team certainly made we think it’s a killer product and where the team is very hard trying to keep buying stock in their product.
Operator
And City’s Mark May have the next question.
Mark A. May – Citigroup Global Markets Inc.
Thank you. why don’t you if noticed any change and sign ups or conversions in the few weeks here since you’ve rolled out the prime price increase for new customers and if you could maybe comment on the what may have contributed to the deceleration and year–on-year our growth and media sales in North America. Thanks.
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of prime, it’s early but we are encouraged with what we see so far. Just over the last several weeks, our prime subscribers continue to grow week-over-week. New trials, the adoption of new trials again post the increase are growing very nicely. So those customers accepting new trials is growing very fast. We only have a few days of information related to conversion. And we are encouraged by what we see there.
So overall we are very encouraged and the reason why is the customers we believe are responding to just a great service. And so we are continuously being reminded that for customers in terms of the offering we have in the physical side as well as the offerings that we have in the digital side as well. So we are very encouraged there.
In terms of the North American media, we did see from a growth standpoint, it’s 13%year-over-year for North American media that compares to 14% in Q1 of last year. It is down a little bit sequentially from Q4 – Q4 keep in mind we do have video games and video consoles in that number in Q4. And there is certainly number of different factors, but that certainly one that is impacting the Q4 numbers. And it’s certainly seasonal as you would expect that there is some great launches of consoles in Q4 that are impacting that number.
Operator

We’ll now turn to Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.
Douglas T. Anmuth – JPMorgan Securities LLC

Great. Thanks for taking the question. Tom, I was just hoping you could give us your view on units growth and how you think about that going forward. How important of a metrics it is because we’re seeing somewhat of a decoupling here as revenue and gross profit reaccelerated, but units obviously (indiscernible) as media came down. Can you talk a little bit about that? Thank you.

Thomas J. Szkutak
Sure as you mentioned unit growth was actually decelerated a little bit from Q4 and also from last year with 23% year-over-year in Q1. One thing to keep in mind is that our web services business is growing at a faster rate. We don’t incorporate any units from AWS in that metric. But overall, you’re right we continue to – from a growth standpoint we had a small acceleration of growth from Q4 to Q1 from a revenue standpoint, again on local currency basis going from 22% to 23%, we are very pleased with the fundamentals that I talked about earlier that’s impacting that growth rate. So again overall we are pleased and again we think that we see a nice growth rate, and third-party units as a percentage of total units is 40%, which was consistent with what we saw last year so, third-party growth continues to be very strong as well.
Operator

Brian Nowak, SIG has the next question.
Brian T. Nowak - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Thanks. I have two. The first one, just Tom to go back to the unit question, even if we exclude North America and international other from gross profit. Gross profit growth held in there pretty steady at 28%. Just kind of curious, is there anything that we should think about of why gross profit growth and unit growth is decoupling? And is unit growth a really good way to measure the health of the business? And then the second one is on international media. One of the factors you guys have flagged in the past holding down international media is more limited local language content. Can you just help us better quantify the difference in English language digital content compared to foreign language? And what steps are you taking to improve that?
Thomas J. Szkutak

In terms of the – I’ll take the second part of the question first about International media, the growth rate was 4% in the quarter and as I’ve talked about in prior quarters, certainly one of the things that’s happening is we see a conversion from physical to digital. And for example in North-America we are now selling North-America media. We are now selling more digital units than physical units. So over the past twelve months we sold more digital units than physical units.
We are not at that point yet in International and so certainly that’s an opportunity for us as we look at growing International media. So again, it’s certainly something that we are working very hard on and certainly a good opportunity for us. In terms of unit growth, it’s certainly just one measure that we want to – that we’ve thought has been helpful. And that’s why we’ve continued to provide it. It is just one metric, we have many different metrics that we are sharing. But that much more I can add to that but again it’s a metric, was there a third part of the question.
Brian T. Nowak - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP

No I guess, just are there any other puts and takes we should think about in units as we go throughout the year where there are tough compares or easy compares in units from a digital unit perspective or anything?
Thomas J. Szkutak

It’s not that I can think of at the minute. But just keep in mind when you think about our revenue growth always be thinking about there’s certainly a volume component. We have a third-party component, we have a mix component. We’re continuously trading the lower prices for customers. All those factor into the revenue growth rates that you see into the revenue metrics that we provide to you.
Brian T. Nowak - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator
We’ll now hear from Brian Pitz with Jefferies.
Brian J. Pitz – Jefferies LLC

Great, thanks. Regarding fulfillment, does it make sense for you to bring some of the components in-house? We’ve been hearing talk of your own fulfillment network. Can you make any comments on this? And just to follow-up on your digital units point, can you comment on any impact of recent shifts in music and video consumption to subscription based models, from download to own on your media business? Is that having any impact? Thanks.
Thomas J. Szkutak

In terms of fulfillment, there’s not a lot I can comment on in terms of your specific question. What I would say though is we continue to work to be, as we have over the years, to become closer and closer to customers. And so, we’ve certainly done that in a number of different ways. Just the footprint we have from a fulfillment capacity standpoint enables us to be closer to customers and getting great selection even closer to customers. So we continue to work. Certainly Prime was another way to get a faster delivery speed to customers and so we’ll continue to work on our capabilities there to make it even better over time.
In terms of the digital units question, I apologize. There’s not a lot I can comment in terms of your specific question there.
Brian J. Pitz – Jefferies LLC
All right. Thank you.
Operator
And we’ll move on to Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post – Bank of America Merrill Lynch

Tom, we look back at your model and we go back to 2008 and 2009. In the middle of a pretty bad global recession, you were able to put up 7.3% and 7.4% operating margins in international. And now it looks like you’re losing money and maybe for the whole year. Could you talk about some of the drivers that are driving the losses this quarter internationally? What the Company’s patience for losses are internationally. And when you come out of this, how your business will be different and what your margin outlook is for the international profits? Thank you.
Tom A. Alberg

Sure. In terms of what you’re seeing in Q1, and you’ve been seeing this certainly for a few year period here is we’ve investing very heavily in international and we’re doing that in a number of different ways. Certainly from a geographic standpoint, we continue to invest in new geographies, and Italy and Spain were certainly the most recent and you should assume that we’re investing in those geographies. We continue to invest in China and certainly that’s in investment mode.
And then also as we’ve continue to grow in international, we’ve invested in terms of capacity, both fulfillment capacity, as well as infrastructure capacity to support those. So what you saw – you will see some certainly variation over time in the period that you’re talking about. We certainly had particularly coming out of – going into late 2008 and also 2009, we had extra capacity globally. We still did continue to invest, but not near the rates that we’re investing now and that’s why you saw some results that you’ve seen. But again one of the things that you see now in international but in our total results is continue to invest very heavily into the business because of the opportunities that we are seeing.
Justin Post – Bank of America Merrill Lynch

Thank you.
Operator
We’ll now hear from Greg Melich with ISI Group.
Greg Melich – International Strategy & Investment Group LLC

Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask a bit on the decision process that you went through when raising the Prime membership fee. I know you talked about potentially doing $20 to $40. What factors did you look at in deciding on the $20? And related to that, with the deleveraging of shipment costs happening a little bit, was weather an impact on that or is that just the business and how it’s trending?
Thomas J. Szkutak

There was a number of different factors that we have looked at in terms of when we look at the price increase, but the biggest one is we had build – we think we build a great service and we saw that the just particularly the transportation cost since its inception have grown dramatically, we just haven’t done any price increase during that long time period, and that’s really the big reason why we decides to do that. We’ve launched the program with over a million items.
And we have over 20 million items customers are using that service in addition to having the transportation cost being higher they are using that service more and that’s really we applied to it. And it would be on that, there is a lot we can comment.
Greg Melich – International Strategy & Investment Group LLC
Just on the shipment costs deleveraging in the first quarter a little bit. Did weather or something else have an impact, or is that just the trend of the business given the growth rate of shipments?
Thomas J. Szkutak

This many different factors that go into that and certainly, weather would have been one of those.
Operator

We’ll move on to Ron Josey with JMP Securities.
Ron Victor Josey – JMP Securities LLC

Hi guys, thanks for taking the question this is Andrew on for Ron. Quick question around streaming volumes in UK and Germany now that Lovefilm is bundled with Prime? Guys you have any comment?
Thomas J. Szkutak

Unfortunately it is probably a good question for future quarters it just so early and again what little data we have so far it’s very encouraging but it is very early so I think that’s – it’s a good question for future quarters.
Operator

We’ll move to Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.
Heath P. Terry – Goldman Sachs & Co.

Great thanks, obviously a lot of focus on pricing in AWS you are clearly still seeing accelerating growth despite those cuts, could you provide some context on the volume side of that equation whether it’s just growth in customers or workload some way to sort of frame the other side of things outside of just pricing in AWS?
Thomas J. Szkutak

It’s a good question. And I think that something we can certainly work on and tried to be helpful the price change, the most recent price change is certain recent. And what we are commenting on is certainly the Q1 results but – that something that we’ll think about and that would be helpful on that as we go forward. But certainly usage has been this is not something recent. Usage has been very, very strong. And as we’ve continued to lower prices over time, this is the 42nd price decrease that we’ve had and we’ve had a great usage growth over time.
Heath P. Terry – Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. And just on the AWS side, with the sort of nationalistic concerns that we’re seeing around stored data, does that change at all the way that the AWS team is thinking about infrastructure needs for that business or the way that you might be thinking about CapEx?
Thomas J. Szkutak

I think the best way to say it is, and hopefully this answers your question. The team focuses on many different aspects, but certainly the operational aspects of being up and running, being a very secure, reliable set of services, those are something the team is very focused on and spends a lot of time working on. And so beyond that, I’m not sure I can add to it.
Heath P. Terry – Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Thanks, Tom.

Youssef Squali with Cantor Fitzgerald has the next question.
Youssef H. Squali – Cantor Fitzgerald Securities
Yes. Thank you very much. Two quick questions please. First, the HBO deal seems like a seminal event for Prime video in terms of quality and probably the price bit as well. Is this the first of many potentially large deals you’re intent on getting for the platform? Or was this more of an opportunistic transaction that just came your way? And second, just on the P&L, can you just clarify where that $60 million in investment gains came from, please?
Thomas J. Szkutak
Sure. The answer to your second question, which is down below in other relates to a gain primarily from Living Social. They sold their Korean business and that’s reflected in that line item. In terms of the content question, the way we think about it is this. Since we launched the service we’ve continually added – tried to add great content and I think we’ve been pretty successful in doing that. And this is just another contract that we’ve launched into this multi-year to do that and we think it’s great for customers. We’re extremely excited to offer this to customers and we’ll try to keep making the service even better over time.
Youssef H. Squali – Cantor Fitzgerald Securities

Is exclusive video an important consideration for you now?
Thomas J. Szkutak
There’s a number of factors. Certainly we have a number of different arrangements where we have exclusive content and we think that’s great for customers. We’ve also supplemented with other content that’s not exclusive. And we’re obviously, as you know, we’re working on original content as well. So that is exclusive. So those are the things that we’re working on and we see the customer response to all of those and we like what we see.
Youssef H. Squali – Cantor Fitzgerald Securities

Scott Tilghman with B. Riley has the next question.
Ronald Scott Tilghman – B. Riley & Co. LLC
Thanks. Hi Tom, wanted to really ask two related questions. First, following up on the international discussion from before, I was wondering if you could prioritize where the investments are going on the international side between fulfillment, media build out, geography build out, et cetera? And then related, I haven’t seen any discussion on what’s happening on the domestic fulfillment build out this year. I was wondering if you could comment on that as well.
Thomas J. Szkutak
Yes, in terms of the priority, I’m not sure what to add there, but I would say that we’re investing heavily in China and we have been for some time and certainly that’s a factor. We’re investing in new geographies, most notably Italy and Spain. We’re investing in, as I mentioned, fulfillment centers and infrastructure to support that growth. So, again, not a lot to add there. The other part of your question?
Ronald Scott Tilghman – B. Riley & Co. LLC
Well, let me ask you in a different way. If you look at pricing, if you look at infrastructure, if you look at geography, is there one bucket that tends to trump the others?
Thomas J. Szkutak
Again we’ve been pretty consistent how we’ve talked about it. Again, China is an issue. China is a big investment. In all of our geographies, not just international, we’re investing on behalf of customers in terms of lowering prices. And so, that’s having an impact, volume is having an impact. We continue to invest in fulfillment capacity not only for our retail customers, but also for third-parties on behalf of fulfillment by Amazon, sort of making investments there and the others that I mentioned.
Ronald Scott Tilghman – B. Riley & Co. LLC
Fair enough. And on domestic fulfillment?
Thomas J. Szkutak
Domestic fulfillment, as we have in past years, we’ll continue to update you as we go throughout the year. I don’t have any comments today given that we’re just coming out of Q1, but we will be adding fulfillment capacity given the growth rates we’re experiencing and we’ll update you as we go.
Ronald Scott Tilghman – B. Riley & Co. LLC
Okay. Thank you.

We’ll hear from Eric Sheridan with UBS.
Eric J. Sheridan – UBS Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question. A question about your advertising business. There’s been a lot of movement by Google to push PLAs as a product to sellers. I want to know longer term as you guys think about both advertising on Amazon, and also to give out advertising in a way that would allow sellers to bring traffic back to their own websites that might avail themselves of Amazon’s advertising data and user data to help enable those sales. Thank you.
Thomas J. Szkutak
I can’t comment on what we might or might not do in the future, but the team has done a nice job from an advertising perspective and you can see those prominently on our various websites. We view it as another way certainly to help, be able to afford lower prices for customers and again the team has done a very nice job of monetizing those detailed pages to allow us to be able to do that.
Operator
Moving on to Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
Mark S. Mahaney – RBC Capital Markets LLC

Thanks, Tom. Two questions, please. The international media you talked about, I guess the digitization catch-up or whatever of international media. Could you break that down a little bit further? Are there certain categories, i.e., books versus videos, versus music that one of those is dragging internationally? And what is it that needs to happen for that digital shift to occur? Do you need more rights? You just need more devices in the market? What’s the drag there? And then, in terms of the operating income guidance you’re very consistent how you guided the last couple of years. It seems like you’re guiding for more of a sequential decline in operating income in June quarter than you have the last two years. Is that just a different type of seasonality to the business, or are there new near-term investments that you’re making in this June quarter? Thank you.
Thomas J. Szkutak

In terms of the second part of the question, related to the guidance what’s reflected in the Q2 guidance is many different factors, but we are investing. I’ve mentioned a number of different investments that we’re making in International which related to Q1, also relate to Q2. We are investing in content, we are investing in our web services business both from new services as well as pricing.
So again, we are investing in a lot of different areas across the company. So I’m sure there is a number that I’m not mentioning. So again, we are investing, that’s really which we are seeing in the range of guidance that we see in Q2. In terms of International media, we continue to make progress there on our conversion from physical to digital. But we’re just not where we are in North America. And it’s in many different categories and we’ll continue to work on that. And certainly some other things that you see related to video in Europe, certainly trying to address that part of that. So again, we’ll continue to work on the various pieces of that for our International business and look forward to doing that.

Deutsche Bank’s Ross Sandler has the next question.
Ross A. Sandler – Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.

Hey, guys. If you don’t mind I’ll beat the dead horse on the International question. But specifically around China, can you just give us an update on the overall strategy for China? Are the levels of investments going into the country accelerating or are they just stable? And then what kinds of milestones in terms of market share or customer adoption do you guys track to identify success or return on that investment? Thanks.
Thomas J. Szkutak
In China, we are investing a lot and trying to grow the business there. We are certainly investing in fulfillment. We haven’t been investing in our fulfillment network to get even closer to customers. We are doing a lot on the retail basics as we’ve done in other geographies making sure that we have a great in stock availability. We’re making sure that we have [had] a unique selection. So those are the, lot of the things that we’ve done making sure that we have the right pricing in place on behalf of customers making sure that our service levels are where we need them to be.
So those are the things that we’d continue to work on in China. It’s a very large opportunity and we are continuing to work hard. Is it a large investment? Yes it is. And that investment has certainly increased over the past several years.

We’ll now hear from Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird & Company.
Colin A. Sebastian – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.

Thanks. First, just one clarification on the AWS question. Given the comments that customers would see hundreds of millions of dollars of savings in Q2 from the price cuts, I just want to understand or clarify if we should be expecting moderating growth rate in the other segments, at least temporarily? And then lastly just Amazon’s position on the ability of ISPs to add a toll for fastlane network access. Is this a scenario a situation that would change the company’s approach or strategy with regards to video or is this more of a non-factor for you guys? Thanks.
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of the just clarification and just quote, he mentioned that customers will be saving hundreds of millions of dollars over the next several months alone, he didn’t say specifically at the second quarter. So certainly that’s impacting second quarter and it’s reflected in the guidance that you are seeing there. But again we are very happy to do that on behalf of our AWS customers. We’ve done many different price decreases over time and we think that’s great on behalf of customers and we think our teams are and we are positioned very well in that business and we continue to invest in that given the large opportunity that we have there. In terms of the other question, there is not really a lot I can comment there.
Operator

And ladies and gentlemen unfortunately we only have time for one more question which will come from Kerry Rice with Needham & Company.
Kerry Rice – Needham & Co. LLC

Thanks a lot. Just a couple questions. One on customer adds, you didn’t add quite as many new customer accounts as you did in Q1 2013. And so I assume based on your comments that wasn’t related to the price increase around Prime, and so I don’t know if you can add any context there. And then the second question is just around mobile. Obviously, the mobilization throughout the world is an important trend and you guys haven’t talked a lot about it. Wonder if you can give us any context around your strategy there or any metrics.
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of Prime, again over the year-over-year, it is growing very rapidly and then also week-over-week as we look at the metrics over the last several weeks continues to grow week-over-week, so we’re very encouraged by what we’re seeing there. In terms of mobile, it’s certainly a tailwind for our business. We have a number of different things that are working on mobile and we continue to make it easier and easier for customers to shop from a mobile perspective.
Our traffic continues to increase from a mobile perspective. We are excited about what we see there. And we continue trying to find ways to make that even better from an experience standpoint for our customers.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2013 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's conference is also being recorded.
Now for opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Senior Manager of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Fildes
Hello and welcome to our Q4 2013 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, January 30, 2014 only and will include forward-looking statements.
Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as our metrics and commentary on the quarter.
During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2012.
Now, I will turn the call over to Tom.
Tom Szkutak
Thanks, Dave. I will begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 31% to $5.47 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $2.03 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $3.44 billion.
The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth consisting of additional capacities to support fulfillment operations and investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services.
Return on invested capital was 13%, up from 4%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 476 million shares compared with 470 million shares one year ago.
Worldwide revenue grew 20% to $25.59 billion or 22% excluding the $258 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange.
Media revenue increased to $7.23 billion, up 11% or 13% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $17.13 billion, up 23% or 24% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 67% of worldwide sales, up from 65%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 25%. Active customer accounts exceeded 237 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 39% of paid units.
Now I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $18.81 billion or 73.5% of revenue compared with 75.9%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined were $5.9 billion or 23.1% of sales up approximately 210 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $2.84 billion or 11.1% of revenue, compared with 10.3%. Tech and content was $1.69 billion or 6.6% of revenue, compared with 5.7%. Marketing was $1.11 billion or 4.3% of revenue compared with 3.9%.
Now I will talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 26% to $15.33 billion. Media revenue grew 21% to $3.51 billion. EGM revenue grew 25% to $10.65 billion, representing 69% of North America revenues down from 70%. Other revenue grew 52% to $1.17 billion. North America segment operating income increased 19% to $725 million, a 4.7% operating margin.
In the International segment, revenue grew 13% to $10.26 billion. Adjusting for the $244 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 15%. Media revenue grew 3% to $3.71 billion, or 6% excluding foreign exchange and EGM revenues grew 19% to $6.48 billion or 21% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 63% of International revenues, up from 60%. International segment operating income increased to 116% to $151 million, a 1.5% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, International segment operating income increased to 119%.
CSOI increased 29% to $876 million, or 3.4% of revenue, up approximately 20 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI increased 28%.
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income increased 26% to $510 million or 2% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $179 million, resulting in a 40% tax rate for the quarter and 32% rate for the full-year 2013. GAAP net income was $239 million or $0.51 per diluted share, compared with $97 million and $0.21 per diluted share.
Now, I will discuss our full-year results. Revenue grew 22% to $74.45 billion or 24% excluding the impacts of foreign exchange. North America revenue grew 28% to $44.52 billion and International revenue grew 14% to $29.94 billion or 19% growth excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Consolidated segment operating income or CSOI increased 20% to $1.99 billion or 21% excluding the unfavorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange and operating margin was 2.7%, consistent with the prior year. GAAP operating income increased 10% to $745 million or 1% of net sales.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $1 billion year-over-year to $12.45 billion. Inventory increased 23% to $7.41 billion and inventory turns were 8.9, down from 9.3 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 14% to $15.13 billion and accounts payable days decreased to 74 from 76 from the prior year.
I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance.
Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.
For Q1 2014, we expect net sales of between $18.2 billion and $19.9 billion or growth of between 13% and 24%. This guidance anticipates approximately 30 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates.
GAAP operating income, or loss to be between a $200 million loss and $200 million in income, compared with $181 million in income in the first quarter of 2013. This includes approximately $350 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between a $150 million and $550 million, compared with $441 million in the first quarter of 2013. 
We launched Prime in the U.S. nine years ago with free, unlimited two-day shipping on 1 million items in an annual membership priced at $79. Today Prime Selection has grown to over [19] [ph] million items.
Even as fuel and transportation cost have increased, the $79 price has remained the same. We know that customers love Prime as the usage of the shipping benefit has increased dramatically since launch. On a per customer basis, Prime members are ordering more items across more categories with free two-day shipping than ever before.
With the increased cost of fuel and transportation as well as the increased usage among Prime members we’re considering increasing the price of Prime between $20 to $40 in the U.S.
We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
Thanks. With that, Dave, let's move to question.
Dave Fildes
Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move onto the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Absolutely, Mr. Fildes. Well, ladies and gentlemen at this time, we will now open the call up for question. In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Mark May with Citi.
Mark May - Citi
Thanks for talking my questions. The unit growth in the quarter, I believe was around 25%, which was a deceleration notable versus the last couple of quarters I believe the comp even got a little easier. Can you provide any color as to the dynamics in the quarter that may have drove that. Then I am trying to get a sense of how to think about the magnitude of Prime price increase maybe if you could give us a sense of the base of subscribers that that would be applied to. Then lastly on shipping demand, is there anything that Amazon will do differently next holiday season to try to smooth out the pace of demand late in the holiday shopping season.
Tom Szkutak
First, the unit growth, you are right. It was 25% year-over-year it is a small deceleration over the last couple of quarters. Keep in mind that it is certainly our biggest quarter most seasonal and so both, from a revenue and from a unit standpoint you saw a deceleration from Q3 to Q4 of 2012 also, so we saw a deceleration not of the same magnitude we saw back in 2012 from Q3 to Q4.
If you take a look at the total growth, it's 25% on a unit basis, 22% ex-exchange on a revenue basis. We saw very good growth in North America, up 26%. This is again on a revenue basis. It's down sequentially a little bit in the last couple of quarters but certainly up from Q4 of last year, where we grew 23%. In the International, revenue was up 15%, ex-exchange.
If you look at the pieces, certainly one of the biggest things you are seeing is, if you look at the media growth in our digital categories within media and International, it's growing very fast, but as we have been talking about for quite some time, certainly a shift going from physical to digital you see that reflected in the North America media growth rates.
The reason why you don't see it as much in our International is because we are at the very early stages of that. So that's what you are seeing in terms of the differential, certainly one of the key differentials between the International media growth rate and North America growth rate. Also, keep in mind, in other revenue, the AWS revenue is growing very fast is recorded North America segment.
In terms of the Prime in terms of the impact, I am sorry I can't help you with the impact on U.S. What we have said, is globally we have tens of millions of customers and we certainly have been offering Prime in the U.S. longer than International and both segment is growing very fast from a Prime perspective. That's helpful.
Then, from a customer standpoint, during Q4 we worked very hard on behalf of customers to make sure that we can service them. I think the team did a very nice job. We will continue to work on that to get even better in future quarters and in future Q4 going forward.
Operator
Our next question will come from Neil Doshi with CRT Capital.
Unidentified Analyst
Good afternoon. It's actually Rob [ph] on the call for Neil. I have a couple of questions. If you could maybe talk a little bit about the impact of refunds or incentives given to customers to make up for some of the goods that arrive late in the holiday season? Also on Prime, with respect to the increase, would you consider saving that in Prime, perhaps just the new members at first and also would you consider giving an installment option to maybe soften the blow? Thank you.
Tom Szkutak
Yes, in terms of the refunds, we did give some in the form of gift certificates as well as refunding some shipping fees or fees that were incurred by customers for that subset of customers who were impacted. So that's reflected in the Q4 results that you see today. In terms of details of how we would roll out the Prime price increase that we are considering, you have to wait on that, but certainly as I mentioned, it's something that we haven't had any increase in the nine years. Customers certainly love Prime.
The available units for shipment have grown dramatically from one million to over 19 million over the last nine years. We haven't had any price increase. Customer usage, on a per customer basis, has gone up pretty dramatically, given the selection and the convenience of the service. So that's why we are considering, of course during this nine year period, shipping cost have gone up a lot, fuel cost have gone up a lot. So that's certainly the basis for us taking a look at it but in terms of the details, we will be back when we make those decisions back to customers.
Operator
Moving on to Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.
Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan
Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to follow-up on Prime as well. I was hoping, Tom, maybe you could give us some color on how newer Prime members, you have obviously added a lot of them over the recent quarters, but how newer cohorts of Prime members act relative to older cohorts and in particular if they convert as quickly and if they are spending on a similar early trajectory as your more tenured Prime members? Then also, can you just comment on, I believe, the constrained signups in 4Q on Prime? Thanks.
Tom Szkutak
Sure. In terms of the details, I can't really give you a lot of color on the more recent versus the Prime member who have been with us for a long time, except to say that there is a lot of similarities in terms of what we are seeing. In other words customers, when we launched Prime nine years ago, one of the things that we hoped for was customers who would do a lot more cross shopping that they would buy more from us and we are seeing that trend also in more recent Prime additions. The program is growing very fast. We are very, very pleased with it and we think it's great for the business as we look forward as well. What was the second part of the question again?
Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan
4Q, I think you talked about signups being constrained in the quarter.
Tom Szkutak
Again, we have a very fast growth. We put a couple of statistics out in our holiday release on the 26th that you can refer to, but we had very strong growth and it did constrain it a bit and the customers liked it. Again, there is lot of demand for the service and we are going to continue to make sure that we can satisfy customers there and we thought it was appropriate to do so, to do that during Q4.
Operator
We will move on to Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.
Scott Devitt - Morgan Stanley
Hi, Tom. A couple of questions. Starting with continue the trend with Prime questions. First, you mentioned higher shipping costs being a driver of potentially higher prices in the U.S. The U.S. Prime service is also the only one that has Kindle lending library and video and was just wondering if potentially if those additional services led you think about increasing price as well to potentially further bolster either or both.
Then secondly international CSOI has been on the glide path lower over the past few years and if that's happened, the organic international growth rates moderated during the same period.
Then just wondering going back to the decision to embark on the international investment cycle, if you anticipated the current revenue growth rate that you are experiencing, and if not, where are the areas in the business where you could point to that we would begin to see growth that has not yet evident in the international business. Thank you.
Tom Szkutak
Sure. In terms of the first part, we have added a lot of new services to Prime beyond this shipping benefits you mentioned Kindle owners lending library. Certainly video, Prime Instant Video we are investing very heavily, and so those are certainly costly. Those aren't the reasons for the price increases that we’re contemplating. That decision again is just based on - we have not done our price increase in nine years. Shipping costs have gone up if you look back very considerably over the nine-year period.
Customers like the service, they are using it a lot more and we have a lot more selection. They are using it a lot more and so that's the reason why we are looking at the increase.
In terms of the international growth, the growth was solid, with revenue ex-exchange at 15% the unit growth was considerably faster than that, primarily because third-party growth was very strong and certainly FBA is a component of that and when you think about the capacity that we built for not only for retail, but also for our third parties and we are able to offer our FBA items through Prime as well, so we are very happy with the capacity that we have built across the world, including our international operations and that's reflected in the results that you are seeing.
Certainly one of the reasons why you are seeing the growth of operating income up over 100% in Q4 for international is because of the mix of third-party certainly helping that, so it's a combination of a number of factors, but certainly that's one that’s a significant call out.
Operator
Our next question comes from Justin Post of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Great. A couple of things. I was hoping you could talk about your initiatives with AmazonFresh. What you are seeing in the Bay Area and Los Angeles so far? Are you seeing more units per customer?
Then maybe talk a little bit about the international Kindle stores. Could you start to see the better media results as you build out that infrastructure? Thank you.
Tom Szkutak
Sure. In terms of Fresh in LA in the Bay area, it's very, very early. We like what we see. Customers like the service. There has been good adoption. There has been good conversion from the Prime trials. So we are very pleased with what we were seeing there, but it is still very early. So you will have to stay tuned on that one. But again, it's very early but we like what we see.
In terms of International Kindle stores, absolutely. To be very clear, if you look at the Kindle content growth in Q4 in International, it's very strong. It's just again, we are at the early stages of this cycle from physical to digital. So the growth rate is very strong and the and we saw similar type things when look back in the U.S. in terms of trends, but again, it's at the early part of the cycle in that conversion.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
We will now hear from Brian Nowak with Susquehanna.
Brian Nowak - Susquehanna
Thanks. It looks like a 1P growth margin, ex-shipping expanded nicely year-on-year again. I was wondering if you could talk to some of the margins or some of the drivers of 1P growth profitability getting better? And how should we think about the sustainability of that over time? Thanks.
Tom Szkutak
We are not breaking out the first party margins, if you will. So I can't talk to the specifics of that but our retail business is very good. The combination of our retail business is in our third-party business on a platform. It works for us. We think it's very important to have both offerings for a number of reasons. One is, from a customer experience standpoint, we like the fact that customers come to our detail pages on our respective websites around the world they see competitive offerings. They know that we are very excited about making sure we get great values for customers and we price our products, appropriately and competitively low. So having the third-parties on our website certainly helps do that. It also adds additional selection that we don't have. So the combination of being able to make sure we have a competitive marketplaces as well as add great unique selection from both retail offerings and third-parties to make it work. So that's why we don't initially about first-party or third-party in terms of margins, but it's a combination of those working together on a platform that makes it work.
Brian Nowak - Susquehanna
Thank you.
Operator
We will now hear from on John Blackledge with Cowen & Company.
John Blackledge - Cowen & Company
Great. Thank you. A couple of questions. With the potential pricing change of Prime in the U.S. would Amazon consider offering Prime Instant Video separately? And in terms of Prime Instant Video, can you discuss the change in marketing spend for the service on a year-over-year basis 4Q13 versus 4Q12? Then just, in the North America electronics and other goods segment, could you call out any particular categories that you drove the growth? Thank you.
Tom Szkutak
In terms of Prime, there is not a lot I can help you with there. We certainly have - it's a great offering for customers. I wouldn't speculate what we would do or not do going forward but we like the service that we have. We continue to invest in our Prime offering and it comes in a number of different forms. We will continue to add unique selections that Prime eligible. We have a great pattern of doing that over the nine-year period. We have also offered other services, as you mentioned, in terms of Prime Instant Video as well as Kindle Owners' Lending Library. So it's a great value for customers and we plan on keeping that a great value for customers even with the price increase that we are considering in the U.S.
John Blackledge - Cowen & Company
Great. Thanks. And in the North America, in the electronics and other goods segment, just wondering if there are any particular categories that drove the growth?
Tom Szkutak
Yes, it was very broad, in terms of growth. We are very fortunate that we saw very good growth across many different categories. Certainly, in a few call it's a softline categories were very strong, consumables are very strong again in number of different areas those sort of lengthy [columns].
Operator
Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets has the next question.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets
Yes. Just stick with that EGM category North America. It looks to us like it has decelerated relatively sharply. I thought you were going to call out some areas of weakness there. Is there anything that cause that growth rate - you would call out that caused the growth rate to decelerate on easy comp? Then Tom, could did you want to call it anything related to whether or UPS started to think that those impacts [material business].
Tom Szkutak
Well, again, I think the question was around EGM in North America in good 25% already did decelerate from Q3. Keep in mind that a number of the categories with EGM this certainly is seasonal impact. If you look back to last year, Q4 growth rate in North America was 24%, so we actually saw an acceleration from Q4 last year to Q4 this year slightly.
Then, sorry, Mark. Second part of your question was related to?
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets
Did you want to call it anything related to weather an UPS?
Tom Szkutak
No. I mean, I think, certainly some of the UPS issues were documented in the press. From our standpoint, our team did a very good job of serving customers. We did have the issues that you are describing, but again I will continue work on behalf of customers to make sure improve that experience over time and we didn't serve them well. We certainly did give some GCs to customers who also reimbursed them for shipping costs with where they incurred that and we will continue to make that better for customers over time.
Operator
Moving on to Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein.
Carlos Kirjner - Bernstein
Thank you. The two quick questions. Your CapEx was just slightly higher than last year's same period if you this correct for the real estate purchase. Even though the business overall grew 22% and you said AWS grew very fast. Does this relative decrease in CapEx signal an expectation AWS is going to grow slower?
Secondly, again, the Prime price increase, if you haves tens of millions of prime users that decreasing price at least $20 with no incremental expense. That's quite a good chunk of money. Do you have specific to reinvest that money? Thank you.
The first part of your question, do we expect, is this an indication that AWS is slowing down. No. It's not. Actually, we are very pleased with the AWS business. It's growing very fast. The team is doing a fantastic job from a product and service standpoint and that we are very excited about that business, so I wouldn't form any pins about what CapEx might be in the future related to the growth rates and AWS is going very, very well.
Then you know the price increase on Prime, anything that we would invest would be an independent decision. From that, again, I think in the opening remarks I talked about the rationale as to why and that's really what's driving that decision and then our investment decisions would be independent of that.
Operator
Greg Melich with ISI Group has the next question.
Greg Melich - ISI Group
Hi. Thanks, Tom. Going back to Prime, you consider the price increase, do you think the brand is such that you would be running to price seller or [tier] based on the value that's offered and sort of services you provided to certain customers?
Then second, on the categories, I believe you called out a few quarters earlier that clothing in particular was one and third-party clothing had picked up a lot. Did you see that this holiday just given the importance of that category in the season?
Tom Szkutak
I will take the second part first. Softlines is very strong in Q4, which clothing is a piece of that.
In terms of tiers on Prime, I wouldn't speculate. We might or might not do in the future, but we like the Prime program where we have invested very heavily in it. We continue or you should expect us to continue making it even better over time.
Unidentified Analyst
There's no prohibition to that but just do you still like it the way it is.
Tom Szkutak
Yes, we like it the way it is. Yes. But again, if you look back at what we have done, you can't expect that we might do going forward, but certainly we have had, in the U.S., Prime in place for nine years. We have added a massive selection during that time period. We have also added, this is on the physical side and we have also added digital content as well to the service in the U.S. with Kindle Owners' Lending Library as well as Prime Instant Video and so it's a great value for customers. We see that customers love it and we are going to continue to try and make that even better for customers over time.

Ron Josey - JMP Securities
Great. Thanks for taking the questions. So I wanted to follow-up on AWS and talk a little bit on pricing. While it is certain coming down as efficiencies improve but I believe AWS is sold in hour increments. I think Google's compete solution is sold on a per minute views. So I was wondering if you thought about maybe changing the way AWS is charged to maybe per minute? And then a quick follow-up on just fulfillment centers, if you could just remind us what you ended the year with and if you have any plans for this year? Thank you.
Tom Szkutak
Sure. I will take the second part first, the fulfillment centers. We opened seven on a net basis. So that's the net adds, but if you take that as a percentage for total fulfillment centers, you will get a number, but our square footage actually grew at quite a bit faster rate than that. Keep in mind that, I think we have talked about it in previous calls, we did have some smaller older facilities that we consolidated into larger ones. So that's a net seven. Again the square footage growth is higher than that.
In terms of pricing on AWS, the team has done a fantastic job looking at the best way to run that part of our business. I wouldn't want to speculate what they would or wouldn't do related to pricing, but they are certainly making sure that they have offered great services to customers and they are great values to customers as well. And we are very excited about that part of the business.
Ron Josey - JMP Securities

We will now hear from Chad Bartley with Pacific Crest.
Chad Bartley - Pacific Crest
Hi. Thank you. Two quick questions. How much of the slowdown in revenue in unit growth was a function of the shorter shopping season in Q4? And then, in terms of raising the price on Prime, how much of that might be based on customers' reaction behavior after recently raising the threshold for free shipping to $35?
Tom Szkutak
In terms of the shorter period for shopping, it's hard to tell, honestly. It's hard to know. It definitely was a shorter period from post-Thanksgiving to the holiday. But again, hard to know. And then, sorry, your other part of your question?
Chad Bartley - Pacific Crest
I am curious if the potential price increase on Prime and your confidence in doing that and that it wouldn't impact the adoption of Prime. How much of that is tied to the early results of raising the shipper saving threshold to $35 from $25?
Tom Szkutak
They were independent decisions. They weren't related.
Chad Bartley - Pacific Crest
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thomas Forte with Telsey Advisory Group has the next question.
Thomas Forte - Telsey Advisory Group
Great. Thanks for taking my question. So, when we think about shipping costs, I know you are talking about raising the rate on Prime, but you just indicated that you added seven fulfillment centers in 2013 on a net basis. As you get closer to the consumer and you shorten the shipped miles, how should we think about the benefit on shipping expenses from just having more fulfillment centers close to the consumer?
Tom Szkutak
Yes. There's no question that as we grow our footprint, we get closer and closer to customers with additional selection and that certainly helped us not raise prices or look at raising prices before this. So certainly we will continue to roll out our footprint. We are trying to make our networks as efficient as possible. And that's even with this price increase that we are looking at. It still enables us to make sure that we have Prime at a great value to customers and that's something that's very important to us, because we know it's very important to our customers.
Operator
Moving onto Brian Pitz with Jefferies.
Brian Pitz - Jefferies
Great. Thanks. In terms of digital content how are exclusive titles and original series driving user growth and Prime memberships? And any color on what kind of engagement dynamics you are seeing across the different platforms? Thank you.
Tom Szkutak
Could you repeat the question please?
Brian Pitz - Jefferies
Sure. In terms of digital content, I am just trying to figure out how some of your exclusive content titles are driving user growth and Prime memberships and any color just on what type of engagement you are seeing across different platforms via PC, tablet et cetera.
Tom Szkutak
We are seeing customers like the digital content. We are seeing great engagement, we are not breaking out in terms of the form, but again we are seeing great engagement. We do track very closely the Prime customers to come from free trials for examples.
They come through the pipeline for digital content from free trial standpoint, we track those conversions and we see that's growing very nicely. We do look at customers that use our Prime Instant Video, what are their shopping patterns look like both side of digital content.
Beyond the free content we have on there, do they buy more digital content and certainly we are seeing nice growth in digital content because of that, because they do. They also do a lot of shopping physical categories as well, so those things we are tracking very closely and it's a great pipeline for us as customers look at the total value proposition for Prime, including digital content.
Operator
Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs has the next question.
Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs
Great. Thanks. Tom, you mentioned a strong growth in AWS. Looking at the deceleration in the North America and other line, how should investors think about the relative growth of AWS versus the advertising and financial partnership that make up the rest of that segment? Then just on Fresh with L.A. and San Francisco's performance centers caring a number of non-perishable SKUs. What does Fresh do for your same day fulfillment capabilities in those markets?
Tom Szkutak
In terms of AWS, I think the best way to think about it is a number of things other than AWS can be a lumpy, and you should assume when you look at the North America growth for Q4, our AWS revenue is growing at a faster rate than other.
Then in terms of Fresh, when you look at those two and look at the new offerings that we have in the Bay Area and in the L.A. area it's certainly helping our same day delivery and they work hand in hand. In another words, we have increased the capability both, for Fresh as well as for our non-Fresh part of our business there in those locations.
Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs
Great. Thank you.
Operator
We will now hear from Youssef Squali with Cantor Fitzgerald.
Youssef Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald
Thank you very much. Two questions please. First, have you seen any impact from the rise of Google's PLA this quarter? Second, are you using Kiva's technology in your food distribution centers particularly for perishables? Our understanding is that is not optimized for that, but is that true and if not, are there any other solutions outside of Amazon that do that optimally? Thank you.
Tom Szkutak
In terms of Kiva, it's very early. We are early in our installations there, that's really all I can say. We have it in the few facilities. It's going very well, very pleased with having Kiva as part of the Amazon family, if you will, and we are excited about the opportunity that brings us going forward.
Youssef Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald
On the PLAs?
Tom Szkutak
I can't comment.
Youssef Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald
Okay. Thank you.

Our next question will come from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank
Thanks. Tom, just a quick high-level question, so consumers in smartphone markets are spending about half their time on mobile these days and a lot of that's coming off of PC. I am sure that is a great kind of new customer acquisition channel for you guys, but in terms of existing Amazon customers, are you guys seeing purchase frequency for physical products go up because of having phones with you all day? Or is it just swapping off of PC and into these newer channels? Thanks
Tom Szkutak
I kind of view just having the more connected devices, is just a tailwind for our business, and it's additive. It's certainly helping our business grow. So whether that's phones or tablets, it's just a tailwind for our business. And we think it will continue to be so. So customers will certainly still purchase from their desktop or their laptop and so the tablet mobile will not be completely additive, but it will certainly be a tailwind for our business. It's just anytime customers have easier access to be able to purchase, that's good for us.
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one additional question from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.
Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray
Thank you. Good afternoon. Could you just remind us on just kind of high level philosophy, the trade-off between revenue growth and earnings. I think investors typically think that you see this as all of your market as nascent and profitability as kind of a distant thought. Is that still the case and any guidance in terms of how to think about that over the next two, five, ten years? Thank you.
Tom Szkutak
Sure. We track a lot of our investments on a discreet basis as best we can. We are looking to maximize. Can you hear me okay?
Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray
Yes.
Tom Szkutak
We are looking to maximize free cash flow in those investments over time. So we have some investments that certainly start to pay-off and become profitable in a three to five year period. We have others that have been a bit longer. But again, we are monitoring those investments very carefully. Our goal is to maximize free cash flow for investors over time. That's clearly our goal. And that's something that we are working towards.
All that being said, we are investing a lot in the business right now. You can see that when you look at our results and the reason why we are doing that is because of the very large opportunities that we see. We do go in cycles, as you have seen in our historical results, from time to time. We will pull back to make sure the model is working and we have done that and I am sure you will see that going forward at times as well. But again, we are focused on making sure that we have a great customer experience with maximized free cash flow over the long term.
Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray
Got it. Thank you.
Dave Fildes

Thank you for standing by. Good day everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com Third Quarter 2013 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today’s call is being recorded.
For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Sean Boyle. Please go ahead sir.

Sean Boyle
Hello and welcome to our Q3 2013 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management’s views as of today, October 24, 2013 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today’s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.
As you listen to today’s conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as our metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2012.
Now, I’ll turn the call over to Tom.

Tom Szkutak
Thanks Sean. I will begin with comments on our third quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 48% to $4.98 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 63% to $388 million. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.59 billion. This amount includes $1.4 billion in purchases of our previously leased corporate office space as well as property for development of additional corporate office space located in Seattle, Washington, which we purchased in the fourth quarter of 2012. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of our continued business growth consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
Return on invested capital was 3%, down from 10%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 475 million shares compared with 469 million shares.
Worldwide revenue grew 24% to $17.09 billion or 26% excluding the $332 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in the foreign exchange rate. We are grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers.
Media revenue increased to $5.03 billion, up 9% or 13% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $11.05 billion, up 29% or 31% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 65% of worldwide sales, up from 62%.Worldwide paid unit growth was 29%. Active customer accounts exceeded 224 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 40% of paid units.
Now, I will discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $12.37 billion or 72.3% of revenue compared with 74.7%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $4.46 billion, or 26.1% of sales, up approximately 250 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $1.96 billion, or 11.5% of revenue, compared with 10.5%. Tech and content was $1.58 billion, or 9.2% of revenue compared with 7.8%. Marketing was $671 million, or 3.9% of revenue, compared with 3.8%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results. In consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 31% to $10.3 billion. Media revenue grew 18% to $2.61 billion. EGM revenue grew 33% to $6.73 billion, representing 65% of North America revenues up from 64%. North America segment operating income increased 1% to $295 million, a 2.9% operating margin.
In the International segment, revenue grew 15% to $6.79 billion. Adjusting for the $327 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 20%. Media revenue increased 2% to $2.42 billion or 9% excluding foreign exchange. And EGM revenue grew 23% to $4.32 billion, or 28% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 64% of International revenues up from 59%.
International segment operating loss was 28 million compared to a $59 million loss in the prior period. Consolidated segment operating income interested 15% to $267 million or 1.6% of revenue down approximately 10 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange CSOI increased 18%.
Unlike CSOI our GAAP operating income or loss includes stock based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating loss was $25 million compared to a $28 million in the prior year period. Our income tax benefit was $12 million, GAAP net loss was $41 million $0.09 per diluted share compared with net loss of $274 million or $0.60 per diluted share. The third quarter 2012 included a loss of $169 million or $0.37 per diluted share related to our equity method share of losses recorded by Living Social primarily attributable to impairment charge of certain assets including goodwill.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.44 billion year-over-year to $7.69 billion. Inventory increased 20% to $6.07 billion and inventory turns were 9.2, down from 9.7 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 20% to $10.04 billion and accounts payable days was 75 consistent with the prior year.
I will conclude my portion of today’s call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainties surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or real settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q4 2013, we expect net sales of between $22.5 billion and $26.5 billion, a growth between 10% and 25%. This guidance anticipates approximately 125 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss will be between a $500 million loss and $500 million in income compared to $405 million income in the fourth quarter of 2012. This includes approximately $350 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss, which excludes stock-based compensation and other expense to be between $150 million loss and $850 million income compared to $678 million income in fourth quarter 2012. We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
Thanks. And with that, Sean, let’s move to questions.

Sean Boyle
Great. Thanks Tom. Let’s move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator
(Operator Instructions) We’ll go first to Ben Schachter with Macquarie.

Ben Schachter - Macquarie
Hey, Tom. On the press release it says that you have signed up millions of new Prime members and I believe if you read it says it if that happened in the last 90 days. I wonder if you ever commented on a time period like that before and is that a normal run rate to add millions of Prime users in 90 days or is there something special in this quarter that drove prime? Thanks.

Tom Szkutak
I don’t recall if we have actually given a 90-day period before. I don’t believe that we have in terms of beyond that it’s not all par that I can add to that, but we are very excited Prime is growing very fast, very excited for the service that we offer customers both in terms of physical and digital goods. So it’s exciting and that’s how we put it in there today in the release.

Operator
We’ll go next to Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.

Scott Devitt - Morgan Stanley
Hi, Tom. Two if I could, first on the Kindle family, it seems like the timing of device launches the e-book library size in local language content could be drivers of different levels of penetration of digital media in the U.S. relative to what you have been able to attain outside the U.S. to-date? And I was wondering if there was anything else notable that you would highlight that helps explain the different dynamic that seems to be playing out within the media revenue line domestically versus international? And whether you think in any of those issues are structural or to just work themselves out with the benefit of time and your execution? And then secondly, if you could talk a bit about how you think about the lifetime value of the non-Prime customer versus the Prime customer and what the intended outcome maybe as it relates to the increase in Super Saver pricing in the U.S. market? Thanks.

Tom Szkutak
In terms of the first question, certainly we have been launched devices in the U.S. earlier in terms of content both you are really referring to mostly e-book content, both growing very fast. The base is different. As you mentioned, we have a higher base in the U.S. just based on when we launch, so you are absolutely right, it’s – you do see that difference in the median line between North America and international. And so it’s just again both growing very nicely right now in terms of digital Kindle books in this case as you referenced, but it’s just different base. And so it looks like lots of opportunity that we have in both segments there, but we are further ahead right now in North America. And then, I am sorry, could you repeat the second part of your question again?

Scott Devitt - Morgan Stanley
Just how you are thinking about the lifetime value of those that are not Prime sales versus Prime sale that you are having an increase recently did with Super Saver Shipping in the U.S. from $25 to $35 threshold?

Tom Szkutak
Sure. In terms of the Prime customers, we have seen knowing a very strong increase and primary [ph] but we have seen very good retention of prime numbers. And so you know certainly when you look at that in terms of lifetime value we have a customer base that’s certainly staying with us longer, they are doing more cross shopping and you know they are getting benefits of prime that we’re offering that we continue to you know add to and then we still have a very good customer base that’s non-prime, you know the you mentioned that the threshold change we did change with different thresholds in various geographies around the world for super saved shipment, or super saver delivery in those geographies and the key to U.S. we have had the $25 threshold for over 10 years and we changed 35 and during this time frame we have certainly increased our selection that’s eligible for that you know by millions items and certainly as you would know you know during this you know rather once the time frame transportation cost and fuel prices have changed them significantly over that time period so we had changed it. So we just thought that was the right thing to do.

Operator
And we will go next to Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.

Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets
I want to ask about the North America EGM line, I guess it's the second quarter in a row you have had acceleration when I asked you about it last quarter I think you singled out fashion apparel and consumer staples. But the growth is, the acceleration really seems to be in-line with easing comps. Is there something in there that you indicates that you’re getting real critical mass with your customers in those two particular categories and then just real quickly on the Kiva Robots is there a reason you would call that out? Should that have some sort of material impact overtime on leverage in the fulfillment cost line? Thank you.

Tom Szkutak
Sure in terms of you know our growth in EGM you highlighted a couple of categories that are growing very nicely, as we mentioned last quarter as well. You know what you’re seeing there and actually the growth is very broad. We have added a lot of unique selection of both our hardline and soft lines categories including consumables and apparently as you mentioned the experience is getting better on the site, unique selection has increased dramatically over the past few year. So, just a number of things they are coming together in those category. So when I look at it, it just seems very broad which we like and you know there is just a lot of new selection with great you know category expansion too over the last several years. So that’s really what you’re seeing there. In terms of Kiva, you know we have launched few FCs you know we think it's an interesting opportunity. I think as I mentioned last quarter this time we’re ahead of the schedule that we had set forth at the time, you know that we joined with Kiva and we’re excited of what we see. It's certainly we will be adding associates certainly overtime in those FCs but this certainly will be productivity with Kiva and you know we will have to stay tuned to see what that looks like but we’re certainly excited about that opportunity and the roll-up.

Operator
And we will go next to Victor Anthony with Topeka Capital Markets.

Victor Anthony - Topeka Capital Markets
So RC [ph] is a metric you’ve highlighted each quarter it's hardly around 20%, 30%, 40% range throughout the quarter in 2010, 2011. It's obviously been depressive over the past several year and half due to investments. Maybe you can help us with the timing of when you expect ROIC to return to levels so in 2011 and second you’re investing a lot in video content for prime instant video, are there any (indiscernible) you can share in terms of conversions from different devices and in the past there has been talk about converting prime into video as a standalone maybe just show your thoughts there, thanks.

Tom Szkutak
Sure keep in mind when the you know as you mentioned we’re investing you know very heavily in the business. We think that’s the right thing to do, we have a lot of you know good long term opportunities which is why we’re doing it. It is depressing, ROIC. Just keep in mind from a pure metric standpoint just as a reminder will we measure ROIC is free cash flow divided by average invested capital. So total assets might have current liabilities and that’s over 5 point average. And so when you do that first in the numerator, we do have keep in mind it’s about $4 billion in our free cash flow number that relates to the purchase. It goes back to Q4 last year, but it’s entered TTM free cash flow that relates to the purchase of our campus here in Seattle and some nearby lands with $1.4 billion of that. So that’s bringing the free cash flow down.
Also keep in mind in the invested capital, we do include cash and marketable securities, which is certainly the largest piece of our invested capital. We think that’s the right thing to do until we have either deploy that capital or return it in some way, but just to keep in mind that that’s included in the metric. So in terms of Prime video, we are getting great usage from a broad set of customers on Kindle as well as other devices and the adoption is going very well. At this point, we can’t share any specific metrics today, but we like what we see. It certainly – we think it’s certainly helping the Prime members, the Prime membership increases that you are seeing. And we think it’s interesting and we are investing there. We included in both our Q3 results as well as the Q4 guidance our assumptions around additional content that we will be acquiring including original content, so very excited about that opportunity.

Operator
We’ll go next to Mark May with Citi.

Mark May - Citi
Thanks for taking my question. The seasonal hiring is I think last year grew about in line with the growth rate in U.S. revenue growth, but this year it looks it’s – you are growing at about 10 percentage points above the midpoint of your range. Is there anything that’s different this year that is driving that? And then second question on pricing, there have been numerous reports recently and I think for a while now that the multi-channel competitors are competing more fiercely with the Amazon in terms of price parity etcetera, what impact are you seeing or do you think you could see from that and sort of how are you addressing it? Thanks.

Tom Szkutak
In terms of the seasonal employees, unfortunately, there is not a lot I can add to that. We are getting ready for an exciting holiday season and that includes making sure that we have the right amount of employees as well as seasonal help during that period. It also includes making sure we have the right capacity in place, making sure we have had a lot of selection in the past couple of years and particularly over the past 12 months and making sure that we have good in-stock levels related to that selection. We are making sure that we have people to help us with not only serving customers with our retail inventory, but also are fulfilled by Amazon grown certainly very strongly over the past year and that impacts the capacity and a number of employees that you see there. So that’s what you are seeing in that number.
In terms of pricing, we operate in a very competitive arena. That’s something that’s new, that’s something that we have been doing since our inception. We have many, many different competitors. You will pass those competitors on your way to work, on the way home. They are offline, they are online. It’s a very competitive marketplace. It’s something – pricing is something that we worked very hard at over the years. We want to make sure we have great values for customers and something that we spend a lot of time on and work very hard to make sure that we can offer that to customers. So I wouldn’t say that it’s done anything. It’s something that we have been dealing with since our inception, but it is a very competitive environment.

Operator
We’ll go next to Carlos Kirjner with Sanford Bernstein.

Carlos Kirjner - Sanford Bernstein
Two quick questions, first how do you see your competitive position versus Alibaba in China and what gives you confidence that you’ve a chance of being a relevant player there even in the long term and secondly in the U.S. you’ve a service similar to subscription video-on-demand which is feature applying which is Amazon Prime Video. While in Europe you’ve a full blown spend alone service with (indiscernible). Why is your strategy in Europe so different from the strategy in the U.S. when it comes to video-on-demand? Thank you.

Tom Szkutak
You know in terms of China it's very early there, there is certainly a room for many winners and it's a very large segment and you know we have seen we have good business there in terms of top-line it's growing and we will continue to look for ways to make sure that we satisfy customer demand. We work on a lot of the same inputs, we work on our other geographies, make sure we have great prices, good selection, speed of delivery, we work very hard in terms of putting in a lot of capacity close to our customers and so are the things that we’re working on and try to ensure success there. In terms of individual competitors you know we have a long standing practice of not let other companies but again there is room for a lot of winners and in terms of you know video content is not a lot. I can you know add to that question I apologize but certainly we had being ramping up our content in the U.S. on Amazon.com as part of Amazon Prime It's something that we have been you know looking at very carefully. We like what we see so far and we think it's interesting but beyond that I can’t speculate where we might do or might not do another location.

Operator
We will go next to Mark Miller with William Blair.

Mark Miller - William Blair
On AmazonFresh can you comment on what you’re seeing in LA versus the Seattle test, how important is the attachment rate with general merchandise and then as you’re making more frequent deliveries are you finding that is driving higher sales of general merchandise?

Tom Szkutak
It's very, very early in LA so there is not what we see so far what we would like, we’re having a lot of selection there on behalf of our customers. It is a great opportunity for customers to get both a number of different items through AmazonFresh and so we’re excited. We like you know the trials that we have done have been very good, the conversion has been good. We look forward even improving that experience even more overtime for customers but it's very early but we like what we see which I will stay tuned on that one.

Mark Miller - William Blair
And general merchandise?

Tom Szkutak
I’m sorry?

Mark Miller - William Blair
Are you selling more general merchandise as a result of more frequent deliveries in that market?

Tom Szkutak
Yes.

I just wanted to ask a question on your acquisition of TenMarks which is really diving a little bit deeper into that cap market. I know you sell and rent the text books. Can you talk a little bit maybe what you’re strategy is there?

Tom Szkutak
You know it's a company that’s doing some interesting things about helping you know students and children learn math. We thought it was an interesting fit for us and you know we look forward to exploring what opportunities we can do together there and you’ve to stay tuned on that one but we think it's doing a very nice job and we’re very excited to have them as part of the Amazon business.

Operator
We will go next to Scott Tilghman with B. Riley.

Scott Tilghman - B. Riley & Co
Just wanted to touch on the North America segment margins for a little bit. We have seen some pretty good progress there in terms of year-over-year improvement, you know little bit of back step last quarter but not too much and the categories fell back. I am just kind of wondering if there is anything unusual in there in terms of timing or investments that maybe called out and how should we think about it – that over the next few quarters?

Tom Szkutak
Sure. In terms of Q3 specifically, Q3 just because of the – as I would call it the Q4 readiness, the seasonal readiness, you see this often in Q3 where both our total and our segment operating profit is lower than other quarters. And that’s certainly what you are seeing in Q3 in North America. So that’s in terms of the investments we are making to get ready for the season we talked about. You start and just quote the capacity that we are adding certainly in multiple geographies, but certainly in the North America it is impacting that as well. You can see it in our fulfillment line item as a percentage of revenue being up. You can see it in our techno content, so we are certainly investing. The other part two that I mentioned earlier is we are investing in video content for Prime in the U.S. And you see that has certainly in those results as well.

Operator
We’ll go next to Tom Forte with Telsey.

Tom Forte - Telsey
Great. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to know where you stand. Last year, I think you added 20 fulfillment centers on a full year basis and then last time you gave us an update, I think this year it was 5 U.S. and a handful international. I wanted to know where you stood on that and why the change versus last year? And then also very quickly, I want to see where you stood or how you felt about your Amazon Locker initiative? Thank you.

Tom Szkutak
Sure. In terms of fulfillment centers, it’s – the number is seven, but it’s a net number. And so included in that are several consolidations, we are building generally larger FCs and we are consolidating some of those. So that’s a net seven. And so what that means is if you were to take that as a percentage of our total fulfillment centers, you certainly a get number that’s less than square footage that we are actually adding. So we are adding square footage that would be significantly higher than that. In terms of lockers, it’s early – it’s another way to get closer to customers to make it convenient for customers. And it’s interesting we have it in a few different geographies right now. And but it is limited, we don’t have it broadly across our full network and so something that we are learning. And it’s an interesting experience and it’s certainly something that over time we will continue to take a closer look at and certainly expand if it makes sense to do so on behalf of customers.

Operator
We’ll go next to Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.

Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan
Great, thanks for taking the question. Just want to ask two things. First, Tom, can you give us some color on where you are in the shift from third-party to first-party e-books and how much of the factor that’s been in reaccelerating media revenue, you have seen reacceleration in media in the last three quarters, I think in North America? And then secondly, it looks like there is six fewer shopping days this holiday season between Black Friday and Christmas, just curious what you do with anything differently to prepare for that and do you think that could actually even drive more holiday shopping online? Thanks.

Tom Szkutak
Sure. In terms of your second one, second question, there are fewer days. There is not a lot that we do different. We certainly see when that happens. And there is some behavioral differences on behalf of customers just because of the shorter time period that we have certainly some more sizable days during that period, but there is not a lot to add to that. In terms of the transition for e-books, in terms of our total growth across Amazon both North America total, our global total, it’s not a significant or meaningful impact to the overall growth rates and certainly this transition has been going on for you know some number of quarters now so it's not a lot I can help you with there.

Operator
We will go next to Greg Melich with ISI Group.

Greg Melich - ISI Group
I want to dig into the inventory a little bit. It looks like the growth slowed to 20% but the sales accelerated. Can you give us some insight as to why that is and maybe which category have outperformed in the quarter?

Tom Szkutak
Sure. I would look at it more from turns perspective and if you look at it more over you know an average turns basis it has gone down and the reason is unique selection, we keep having growth in unique selection it has increased over the past year and stock levels have gotten better and so those are things that are really driving it. In terms of endpoints or any particular quarter you know they can be a little bit lumpy but I would look to the turns.

Operator
We will go next to John Blackledge with Cowen and Company.

John Blackledge - Cowen and Company
Two questions, first into the priorities offered one day or same day delivery at some point, there is something better there you’re offering same day deliver in large markets for certain brick and mortar retailers. And then secondly can you talk about the prospects for login and pay program, how many online merchants have signed up for it and what is Amazon getting out of it economically and/or from getting may be getting data out of purchases? Thank you.

Tom Szkutak
In terms of speed of delivery whether be it one day or same day, you know what’s happened certainly over the past 10 plus years is we have added a lot of selection. We have added fulfillment centers as a result of that we have selection that’s by default you know increased amount of selection that’s closer to customers. As a result of that our speed of delivery has improved and you know certainly for prime customers you know depending upon the geography in the case of U.S. you know express two day shipping for free and then for small fees they can certainly get faster than that. That’s something that you know as you have seen that improvement you know gradually over the past 10 plus years, you’ve seen it, it has certainly gotten even better over the last few years as we have you know rapidly increased the number of fulfillment centers. So that’s something that we think it's important and we will continue to work on behalf of customers to give them those options and to make sure that you know they get product when they want it. In terms of login and pay you know it's something that we think is interesting, you know because of our large customer base and you know the credentials that we have and the secure payments that we have we think it's an interesting opportunity and we think there is certainly interesting ways to monetize that overtime and but again we think it's an interesting opportunity.

Operator
We will go next to Ron Josey with JMP Securities.

Ron Josey - JMP Securities
I wanted to talk new international markets and specifically I think Amazon India was called out given 10 new category launches in the past 120 days or so. So my question related to really the infrastructure in India and how good is it, and to so that Amazon can continue to grow there and in specifically if other countries can follow a model like this and you know Brazil comes to mind. Thank you.

Tom Szkutak
Sure. We have a few different models in India and we from a marketplace model which we offer fulfilled by Amazon which as you mentioned certainly the infrastructure is not as advanced as in some geographies but we also view it as an opportunity and we’re happy to help sellers fulfill it by Amazon. So it's an interesting opportunity, it's very, very early. We’re in investment mode there, it's a long term opportunity but that’s a very exciting opportunity. We were very strong team that’s working on that opportunity. So we are excited about it.

Operator
We’ll go next to Brian Pitz with Jefferies.

Brian Pitz - Jefferies
Great, thanks. Maybe you could comment on what you are seeing domestically and internationally in terms of e-commerce trends in the current quarter, anything specific standout, especially North America given some of the mix commentary we have heard from some of your competitors? And then just some additional comments if you could on growth in the other revenue category, specifically on AWS and/or your advertising business? Thanks.

Tom Szkutak
Sure. I’ll take the second one first. In terms of AWS, it’s growing very, very strong. It’s an area that’s very early for us. It’s growing very, very strong. We have a great team that’s working on it, servicing customers and we are very excited about the long-term opportunity. In terms of you have mentioned the trends in the North America, what you have seen is really a nice steady acceleration of growth since Q4 last year. So if you look back to Q4 last year for North America specifically and you just stress that back over the past four quarters, you are seeing a really nice sequential increase from quarter-to-quarter. And again that gets back to went from 23% in Q4 last year to 26% to 30% and 31% versus the year-over-year increases by quarter for North America revenue. And a lot of this what we talked about earlier, it’s focused on a lot of the retail basics as well as also improving seller performance as well. And so those are the things that are driving it.

Operator
We’ll go next to Jordan Rohan with Stifel Nicolaus.

Jordan Rohan - Stifel Nicolaus
Thank you so much. A follow-up to the last question on U.S., in particular, did you see any weakness or any discernible trends around the government shutdown in August, politics going on in Washington in September and early October? And separately, can you talk about what you are learning from being an investor in living social with the accounting charges aside. Can you talk about your own local business how it may compete with other players in the space and all of the various initiatives you have with, what can be learned from what you know at this point you are no longer a new investor in that company? Thank you.

Tom Szkutak
In terms of North America growth other than what I mentioned on the quarterly growth, Q3 was strong. It was 31% growth. Again, we see the nice steady increase over the past four quarters that the overlap in the quarter from Q3 of last year that was 33%. So again, we like we see some growth perspectives in Q3 for North America. In terms of total growth, given the wide range for Q4 and that reflects our view for Q4, but we are excited about the quarter and about getting ready for customers during this heavy seasonal quarter. So we are excited about what we see there. In terms of living social, there is really not a lot I can add to your question, I apologize. They are doing a good job in terms of local. And we also have a local offering on Amazon. Team is very dedicated to make that work and it’s an interesting area we are learning, but it’s early.

Operator
Our final question will come from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.

Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs
Great, thank you. When you look at the deceleration in growth in North America and other revenue, I mean, obviously it’s still at a very high level, but when we are thinking about the major component to that line, AWS, advertising, credit card relationship, is there anything relevant to the relative growth rates between those components that we should be thinking about?

Tom Szkutak
I am not sure how to answer your question. It is, the only part I would call out you mentioned is a number of different items that are in there. Certainly the largest and you know fastest growing largest area by far is AWS and it's growing very nicely and that certainly reflected in that line item.

Sean Boyle
Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

Thank you for standing by. Good day everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com Second Quarter 2013 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.
For opening remarks, I’d like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Sean Boyle. Please go ahead sir.
Sean Boyle
Hello and welcome to our Q2 2013 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 25, 2013 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K.
As you listen to today’s conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2012.
Now, I’ll turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas J. Szkutak
Thanks Sean. I’ll begin with comments on our second quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 41% to $4.53 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 76% to $265 million. Trailing-12 month capital expenditures were $4.27 billion. This amount includes $1.4 billion in purchases of our previously leased corporate office space, as well as property for development of additional corporate office space located in Seattle, Washington which we purchased in the fourth quarter 2012.
The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth consisting of investments in technology, infrastructure including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
Return on invested capital was 2%, down from 11%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 474 million shares compared with 468 million shares.
Worldwide revenue grew 22% to $15.7 billion or 25% excluding the $392 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rate. We are grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers.
Media revenue increased to $4.4 billion, up 7% or 11% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $10.42 billion, up 28% or 30% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 66% of worldwide sales, up from 64%.Worldwide paid unit growth was 29%. Active customer accounts exceeded 215 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 40% of paid units.
Now I will discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $11.21 billion, or 71.4% of revenue, compared with 73.9%. Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content and G&A combined was $4.09 billion, or 26% of sales, up approximately 275 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $1.76 billion, or 11.2% of revenue compared with 10.1%. Tech and content was $1.43 billion, or 9.1% of revenue, compared with 7.6%. Marketing was $651 million, or 4.1% of revenue consistent with prior period.
Now, let’s talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments, our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item.
In the North America segment, revenue grew 30% to $9.49 billion. Media revenue grew 16% to $2.17 billion. EGM revenue grew 31% to $6.48 billion, representing 68% of North America revenues, up from 67%. North America segment operating income increased 19% to $409 million, a 4.3% operating margin.
In the international segment, revenue grew 13% to $6.21 billion. Adjusting for the $391 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 20%. Media revenue decreased 1% to $2.22 billion, or grew 7% excluding foreign exchange, and EGM revenue grew 22% to $3.94 billion, or 29% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 63% of international revenues, up from 59%.
International segment operating income was zero, down from $16 million in the prior-year period. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, international segment operating income increased to 11%.
CSOI increased 14% to $409 million, or 2.6% of revenue, down approximately 20 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI increased 19%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense.
GAAP operating income decreased 26% to $79 million, or 0.5% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $13 million. GAAP net loss was $7 million or $0.02 per diluted share compared with net income of $7 million and $0.01 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.49 billion year-over-year to $7.46 billion. Inventory increased 24% to $5.42 billion and inventory turns were 9.4, down from 10.1 turns a year-ago as we expanded selection, improved in stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 27% to $8.99 billion and accounts payable days increased to 73 from 68 in the prior-year.
I’ll conclude my portion of today’s call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we’ve seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high-level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It’s not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we’ve described in more detail in our public filings issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among such subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance.
Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.
For Q3, 2013 we expect net sales of between $15.45 billion and $17.15 billion, a growth between 12% and 24%. This guidance anticipates approximately 300 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating loss to be between $440 million and $65 million compared to $28 million in the third quarter of 2012. This includes approximately $340 million of stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $100 million loss and $275 million in income compared to $232 million of income in third quarter 2012. We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection, and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
Thanks. And with that, Sean, let’s move to questions.
Sean Boyle
Great. Thanks Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Ross Sandler from Deutsche Bank.
Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank
Thanks, guys. Just have one question on shipping. It looks like the unit efficiency in shipping continues to improve, what are you guys doing to drive the cost of shipping each unit lower? Are there more cost that can be taken out on a per unit basis? And then as you start looking at same day delivery in some of these markets, including the new grocery program, what incremental costs do you see around doing same day fulfillment? Thanks.
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of the economics, we have great team, operations team that’s working on how do we serve customers reliably and faster. So that – certainly that’s reflected in our transportation costs. Also from a productivity standpoint, we just as we add capacity, which is getting closer and closer to customers with larger selection which is certainly helpful from a productivity standpoint. So, those are some of the dynamics that you need to think about, when you think about our transportation cost and the teams done a great job over the years of becoming even more reliable, faster, and more productive and again that we working on ways to make that it better over time.
Operator
And we’ll move to Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan.
Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan
Great. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping if you could talk a little bit more just on the profitability of the grocery business and how you’ll know when is the right time to expand to more markets beyond Seattle and LA? And then also if you could comment on the European macro environment, just given the growth that you saw in the international business just decelerating a little bit from last quarter? Thanks.
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of the, the fresh business, we started doing the pilot several years ago in Seattle. We did a number of – team has done a great job, inventing on behalf of customers, it’s a very good customer experience. The challenging that we’ve had over the past several years is to how to make it economically viable. And so that’s the team has done a lot of different experiments and invented well on behalf of customers that to see what works. And we took a lot of that knowledge and which enabled us to launch fresh in LA. And it’s very early there, we’re still in the trial period, its good customer experience and we like what we see so far, but it’s very, very early. And so, it’s something that we’ll continue to work on and both from a customer experience and from an economic standpoint. And there is not much more I can add to that right now, so you have to stay tuned and see where that ends up.
Operator
Our next question comes from Mark Miller from William Blair.
Mark Miller - William Blair & Company
Hi. Good afternoon. Could you help us understand the third-party unit growth? I think this is the first quarter in about three years that third-party unit penetration hasn’t increased. And then, additionally I wonder if you could comment at all on potential to expand prime membership options, potentially it is something like a super prime offering for expanded video content and fulfillment options?
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of the third-party unit growth, it was 40% this quarter, which compares to 40% last year in Q2. So again, it is flat as a percentage of total units. One thing we keep in mind though is our digital units are growing at a faster rate than physical. And those digital units are primarily first party units. So if you take out digital units out in both periods, we’re actually up approximately 300 basis points. So, physical seller business is growing very nicely. It’s going at a faster rate than retail and its doing very well and so, very pleased to see that.
Operator
And we’ll move now to Brian Pitz from Jefferies.
Brian Pitz - Jefferies & Company
Great. Thanks. Quick question on fulfillment centers, any color on your current plan for the year in terms of locations, U.S. versus international, timing etcetera. And then separately any comments on the weaker growth in international media? Thanks.
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of FCs we’ve announced to-date five net new facilities in the U.S. We’ve also announced some in international, its still early as we did in prior – last few years, we gave you updates kind of as we went along and so we can update you a little bit later in the year to see how that progresses. But we certainly are adding new capacity and that’s reflected in the guidance which you see in Q3 as we get ready for our Q4 seasonal quarter. In terms of growth, in international media, what you’re seeing there is on a local currency growth basis, you see a 7% growth. That’s consistent with what you’ve seen in the last couple of quarters. We are at the very early stages, we’re excited about what we’re seeing so far in digital. But we’re in that early stage of transformation from digital from physical to digital within international. And so, you see from the release that we’ve launched a lot of new things related to digital over the past 90 days and even prior to that. So, we’re very excited about those launches and excited about the transformation. We are also excited, if you look at our total international business, we’ve got a lot of opportunities to invest in. I talked about the conversion from physical to digital. We also have selection still to add within existing categories, new categories, new geographies, so we’re very excited about the opportunity that we’ve there.
Brian Pitz - Jefferies & Company
Thank you.
Operator
We’ll now go to Scott Devitt from Morgan Stanley.
Scott Devitt - Morgan Stanley
Hi. Thanks. I guess, the International topic again, but it has been asked a few times. So maybe specifically in China, Tom, in terms of what the Company hypothesis is in terms of the way that market plays out over time and how you think about investment spend in that market. And then secondly, as it relates to AWS, it’s nice, the event – the annual event and the quarterly events that happened, I was wondering when you think it makes sense to start talking more about it in releases and on calls? Is it just the 10% revenue threshold or something else that would lead to more discussions on that, on calls like this? Thanks.
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of China, we’re investing heavily in China. And we have – we’ve been for some number of years. We’ve a good customer experience there. We continue to look at ways to make that even better. We’re adding selection across many categories right now. It’s a very interesting geography. And so, we will continue to work on that experience for customers. You should expect us to be in investment mode for some time and, but it’s a very sizable segment, very interesting long-term growth opportunity and we’ll continue to work on making that better for customers and for investors over time.
In terms of AWS, the business is growing very, very strongly. We’ve got a great team that’s innovating on behalf of customers, launching the services, becoming more productive, which allows us to be able to lower prices. We’ve had many price reductions since we started with AWS and we share that very visibly and so we’re excited about that business. And even though we were off to a very good start, it’s a very big opportunity and we continue to invest in that business and we’re very excited to do it. We think its great long-term opportunity and we’ve great team working on it.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets
Great. Thanks. Tom just one question related to consumer packaged goods. Any comments there on whether you’re seeing broader purchases by the Amazon customers of more traditional consumer staples than you've seen in the past and is that something that you’re trying to promote? Thank you.
Thomas J. Szkutak
Yes. We – just to make sure I heard your question, we’re seeing – when you look at our for example, our North America growth, particularly EGM, we’re seeing very good growth across many different categories. But if you call out, we’re seeing very good growth in apparel specifically, and also consumables. And so, the teams has done a very nice job, both teams done a very nice job from a customer experience standpoint and they’re growing very nicely and that is something that we’re seeing, and it does help with frequency to the site as well.
Operator
And we’ll now go to Mark May from Citi.
Mark May - Citi
Thanks for taking my question. Another one on international in the media segment there, I believe that you now have a more comprehensive, kind of localized international strategy for the Kindle. And I wonder if you could talk about what, if any, impact that you think that that might have over the next few quarters in terms of its impact on the international media segment? And also on international, the AWS, I think one of the contributors of growth and we suspect margins in the U.S. has been the success of AWS here. I wonder if you could talk about any plans for AWS outside the U.S.
Thomas J. Szkutak
Sure. In terms of Kindle, you’re right. We now have Kindle stores, if you will, established in all the Amazon domains that we’ve around the world. And recently we announced Kindle Fire HD, its available customers in over 170 countries. We introduced Kindle Paperwhite and Kindle Fire HD in China, both -- that’s both online on our website and also in a number of offline retail locations. So again, there is a lot of advancement in terms of the Kindle, but again, it’s very early. Very encouraged by the opportunity that we have there for customers and our ability to try to capitalize on that from a digital content standpoint. In terms of AWS, the business is expanding, and its incredible opportunity globally. We recognize that, the team recognizes that. And we’ll continue to work on that on behalf of customers.
Operator
Our next question comes from Justin Post from Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch
Thank you. The Company and the business is going through a lot of transitions with digital media, AWS, obviously Prime and potentially same-day delivery. Long time ago, you used to give us kind of a margin outlook for the Company. As you these businesses, do you think that they’re better for Amazon and that you can have greater share of retail as these evolutions happen. And then also, what are the implications on Amazon’s long-term margins as you go through these transitions over time? Any help on that could help. Thanks.
Thomas J. Szkutak
Sure, in terms of the way we’re looking at I’m certainly it is based on the free cash flow potential, and we have a -- we’re in some really interesting great businesses that have a lot of potential from a free cash flow generation standpoint with good and high ROICs which is exciting. From a margin standpoint always challenging to predict where that will come out in terms of absolute numbers. But what we will do is, we want to make sure that we try to maximize free cash flow, that’s something that we’ve always said. So, our strategy hasn’t changed, our outlook hasn’t changed in that regard. Frequently we’d be asked historically is, double-digit operating margins are possible. And I still think it's possible, but also if it means if a good high single-digit operating margin gets us to better, higher free cash flow over time, that’s fine too. So, again our goal is to, we don’t focus on individual margins. Our goal is to make sure that we generate free cash flow, large monthly free cash flow and use that capital efficiently, and so those are goals that we have and we certainly think that opportunity is there in each of the business that we operate in.
Operator
Our next question comes from Ben Schachter from Macquarie.
Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Securities Group
Two quick questions on revenue recognition, over the past some quarters I believe that the certain digital media at least has moved around between the agency and wholesale model. Can you help us quantify how this has actually impacted the reported media revenue rates in other words would 2Q revenue rates have been meaningfully different if the model had been the same. And then the second question, just quickly on Prime, can you remind us how you recognized revenue from the Prime memberships deal over the course of the year? Thanks.
Thomas J. Szkutak
Sure. In terms of the Prime we recognized it over the life of the subscription. And then in terms of third party versus first party certainly we have had some shift within digital media, but again digital media is primarily a first party business, and it happens to be one portion of our business. But you’re actually right, and in terms of our third party business which from a unit perspective is 40% of our total units this quarter. We recognized the share of that revenue, the rev share if you will ad revenue where as the other parts of the business largely were recognized in that as first party revenue, and so we’re recognized in the full amount of the revenue in the current period.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jordan Rohan from Stifel, Nicolaus.
Jordan Rohan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company
Thank you so much. I’m curious about your expansion efforts in Spain since it's a relatively new territory for you, how well situated you are and how ready you are for the fourth quarter there. And also, there have been a lot of stories about Amazon heading into Brazil, but I don’t believe we’ve identified any fulfillment centers and things like that. Can you discuss the extent and breadth of your offering in Brazil whether it's Kindle devices, digital media or something beyond that? Thank you.
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of Spain, we’re very excited about what we see. It's growing very fast. We’re in investment mode and it's an exciting geography for us, and we’re very optimistic over time it will be a great geography for us. So we’re very happy to serve customers in Spain and we’re continuing to -- as we’ve done in other geographies that we’ll continue to serve customers and continue to expand our selection and get service levels even better over time and so I’m excited about that. In terms of Brazil, we do have a Kindle store and we have devices at physical retailers. So, from a Kindle perspective that’s what we’re doing in Brazil.

Our next question comes from Ron Josey from JMP Securities.
Ronald Josey - JMP Securities
Great, thank you for taking my question. I’m wondering if you can talk a little bit about North America EGM. Just given the strength you saw on the business and continued reacceleration, have you seen any sort of impact I’m assuming no, but from price matching programs from offline retailers, and we’ll talk -- and also sale tax. Thank you.
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of North America, total growth we saw an acceleration from last quarter from 26% to 30%. We saw an acceleration in both North American Media as well as North America EGM. Within EGM it was very broad. In terms of growth we saw a very strong growth across many different categories and so very pleased with that, I called out a couple, that were notable in terms of apparel as well as in consumables, certainly those are getting larger and still growing very fast which I call those out. In terms of competitiveness, it's been, it's very competitive, it is today, it has been since our inception. We have many different competitors online. We have many competitors offline. As you go to your home or office you pass our competitors every day. That’s an environment where we’re used to dealing in. It’s something that’s not new. It's something that we see in all of our geographies across many different categories.

Our next question comes from the line of comes from Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs.
Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs
Great, thank you Tom. As you get closer to customers with more FCs and more efficient shipping, what kind of impact is that having on conversion rates, on within customers in those areas as shipping time shorten or delivery time shorten. And then as you look at the early adopters for Fresh in LA any sense that you can share with us of what kind of cross shopping you’re seeing among new Fresh customers, are they bundling media in EGM in those other orders or to any degree are these new Amazon – new to Amazon customers that have been brought in purely because of Fresh?
Thomas J. Szkutak
If you take a look at LA, it's just again I’m very excited and it's very early. So, I think on that one you’ll just have to stay tuned. But in terms of, as we get closer and closer to customers with fulfillment, we have seen growth due to that and it’s manifested its way – in a few different ways, but notably you’ll see it in Prime. Because of our fulfillment logistics capability we’ve been able to offer Prime broadly and we just have selection, it's just closer and closer to customers. And if you look back over the last several years, there’s been different reasons why we’ve grown away, we have grown in terms of adding the selection and making sure that we have really sharp pricing and, but certainly Prime and which includes a speedy delivery certainly been notable, has had a notable impact. And we’re very pleased with the Prime program, customers like it. We’re having -- we see very strong growth in Prime subscribers. We see very good retention of Prime members. So, it's a great program for us and certainly again delivery speed is certainly impacting that program, our overall growth.

Our next question comes from Anthony Diclemente from Barclays.
Anthony Diclemente – Barclays Capital 
Thank you. On the topic of media just wondering Tom if there are any callouts in terms of categories of strength or weakness within physical or digital media that you could call out, and along those lines just wondering if you could comment on your media device rollout strategy from here I there’s anything you can tell us. And then quickly, is there any reason PrimeInstant Video isn’t available for Android devices? Thank you.
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of media growth not a lot of callouts except probably the obvious is digital units growing very fast relative to physical units and we’re excited to see that. And because of where we are, we’re further penetrated in North America, you’re seeing a bigger impact in our growth rate than you are in international and we certainly see that but not a lot of other callouts there, but again we’re very pleased and certainly customers are responding to many things including selection and great prices and everything else within those digital offerings, but also they’re responding to unique selection that we have. And if you take a look at our release you’ll see the specific numbers related to some of the exclusions we have, and certainly that’s having an impact. So there’s many, many different things that are working for us in that space as part of our overall ecosystem for digital that we’re pleased with. In terms of our device plan, we’re very pleased with the devices we have and to offer customers we think we have a great offering both in terms of Kindle and Kindle Fire. And in terms of our future roadmap, we’ve a long standing practice of not talking about what that will be prior to announcement.

Our next question comes from Youssef Squali from Cantor Fitzgerald.
Youssef Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald
Thank you very much, two quick questions please. Tech and contents was up to 9% of revenues, I think that’s the highest it's ever been. How much of that is actually streaming content related and how do we look at it going forward, does it stay at that elevated level? And then on Fresh, is that business profitable for you in the Seattle area? Thanks.
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of tech and content we’re spending in a number of different areas, but there’s a few that I’d like to highlight. One is certainly keep in mind that the infrastructure related to our very fast growing web services business is included in tech and content, so certainly as we ramp up that business and it's becoming more sizable and growing very fast you’re seeing that impacting that line item. We’re also investing very heavily in digital and that’s across many different parts of our digital offerings there, that’s also included. Any of the tech teams they’re working on customer experience across Amazon as we grow so as we support both our seller businesses and our retail businesses, they’re included in that line item. So, certainly that’s what you’re seeing there. In terms of Fresh we’re not breaking out the financials but keep in mind that Fresh was designed as a pilot and certainly the economics that improved over time through invention on behalf of the team there as well as operating efficiency. So, again that was set up as a test and which has enabled us to launch LA.

We will now go to Colin Sebastian from Robert Baird.
Colin Sebastian - Robert W. Baird
Thanks very much. I guess a quick follow up on the device strategy and given the fairly quick pace of innovation in the tablet market overall. I wonder if you can contrast the benefits of that for Amazon given the popularity of shopping in media apps with the cost and complexity of maintaining your own line of hardware, and related to this it seems as if the pace of new content acquisition on licensing has picked up a bit and so I wonder if that reflects any changes in either the competitive dynamics or pricing or is some sort of other strategy shift on your part? Thanks.
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of some of the dynamics, we’re very excited about our digital business. We’re inventing, you’ll see a lot of different inventions both on the hardware side as well as on the software side from a device standpoint. You’ll also see a lot of invention around the content side and we think for example PrimeInstant Video which combines video in our Prime membership is very compelling, and we’re investing heavily in content. It's still very early there but we’re finding that customer’s certainly existing Prime members are more and more streaming content. We’re having new Prime members come to Amazon largely because of video in terms of one segment of that population that’s coming, the new Prime members is because of PrimeInstant Video and we can see that based on the free trials and the conversion of those free trials from related to PrimeInstant Video and so that’s certainly one portion of our growth in Prime memberships which we find exciting. For us to be able to offer exclusive content on the book side is very interesting. So, again we’re investing a lot of different -- across a lot of different areas and yes there are a lot of different dynamics, but we think we’re well suited for both the device software and content side of those businesses.

Our next question comes from Matt Nemer from Wells Fargo Securities.
Matthew Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities
Good afternoon, just two questions. One, given your comments that international will be in investment mode for some time. Can you just remind us what the priorities are there from either a geography or a product standpoint. And then secondly following the management changes at Quidsi, I would love an update on the plans for that business and maybe just a sense for how integrated it is to Amazon Retail? Thanks.
Thomas J. Szkutak
Yeah, in terms of the international piece what I was referring to was an investment move, sometime I was referring to China specifically and we have a lot of opportunity to grow. We’re still continuing to invest in international, but I would -- my comment was specifically around China. And then your question around Quidsi?
Operator
And we’ll go to Steven Ju from Credit Suisse.
Steven Ju - Credit Suisse
Tom, is there …
Thomas J. Szkutak
Hello, just to follow-up I think on the Quidsi question I think was around the founders leaving and we’re well positioned with them leaving, and this is the last part of that. But we did -- we’re fortunate to have the founders with us for a number of years, and they did a great job while they were here. And we have a great team at Quidsi, and we’re pleased with that business and the team -- our retail team works very closely with Quidsi business and we’re excited to have it as part of the Amazon team.
Steven Ju - Credit Suisse
Tom, is there anything you can share in terms of the situation in Germany with the worker strike’s, are you able to fulfill from an unaffected fulfillment centers or is it causing some invents to your operations there? And also if you could update us on what you’ve been doing with Kiva since you’ve acquired it. Are you focusing on internal integration, are you selling more aggressively through external clients? Thanks.
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of Germany there’s a not a lot I can add to there. We’re certainly serving customers, those results are reflected in our overall total results that you see today for Q2 as well as our international results. In terms of Kiva we certainly -- we gave a great team there, we love the technology. We don’t have any announcements in terms of rollouts, but we’re ahead of schedule from what we had set out at the time of purchase which we’re happy about. So, I’ll have to stay tuned on the actual rollout, but we’re very encouraged by what we see there.

Good day everyone, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Amazon.com First Quarter 2013 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.
For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Sean Boyle. Mr. Boyle, please go ahead.
Sean Boyle
Hello and welcome to our Q1 2013 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 25, 2013 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K.
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2012.
Now, I’ll turn the call over to Tom.
Tom Szkutak
Thanks Sean. I’ll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 39% to $4.25 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 85% to $177 million. Trailing-12 month capital expenditures were $4.07 billion.
This amount includes $1.4 billion in purchases of our previously leased corporate office space, as well as property for development of additional corporate office space located in Seattle, Washington which we purchased in the fourth quarter 2012.
The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth consisting of investments in technology, infrastructure including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
Return on invested capital was 1%, down from 12%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 471 million shares compared with 464 million one year ago.
Worldwide revenue grew 22% to $16.07 billion or 24% excluding the $302 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rate. We are grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers.
Media revenue increased to $5.06 billion, up 7% or 10% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $10.21 billion, up 28% or 30% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 64% of worldwide sales, up from 60%.
Worldwide paid unit growth was 30%. Active customer accounts exceeded 209 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 40% of paid units.
Now, I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $11.8 billion, or 73.4% of revenue, compared with 76.1%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $3.83 billion, or 23.8% of sales, up approximately 289 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $1.74 billion, or 10.8% of revenue compared with 9.5%. Tech and content was $1.26 billion, or 7.9% of revenue, compared with 6.5%. Marketing was $616 million, or 3.8% of revenue compared with 3.6%.
Now, let’s talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments, our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item.
In the North America segment, revenue grew 26% to $9.39 billion. Media revenue grew 14% to $2.51 billion. EGM revenue grew 28% to $6.13 billion, representing 65% of North America revenues, up from 64%. North America segment operating income increased 31% to $457 million, a 4.9% operating margin.
In the international segment, revenue grew 16% to $6.68 billion. Adjusting for the $301 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 21%. Media revenue grew 1% to $2.54 billion, or 7% excluding foreign exchange and EGM revenue grew 28% to $4.09 billion, or 32% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 61% of international revenues, up from 56%.
International segment operating loss was $16 million, a 0.2% negative operating margin compared with income of $49 million.
CSOI increased 11% to $441 million, or 2.7% of revenue, down approximately 27 basis points year-over-year. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 6% to $181 million, or 1.1% of net sales.
Our income tax benefit was $18 million it includes $46 million of discrete tax benefits primarily resulting from the retroactive reinstatement of the federal research and development credit that was enacted in January 2013. GAAP net income was $82 million or $0.18 per diluted share compared with $130 million and $0.28 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.18 billion year over year to $7.89 billion. Inventory increased 27% to $5.4 billion and inventory turns were 9.5, down from 10.4 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 29% to $8.92 billion and accounts payable days increased to 68 from 62 in the prior year.
I will conclude my portion of today’s call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we’ve seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumption. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high-level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance, as we’ve described in more detail in our public filings issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among such subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance.
Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments or settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.
For Q2, 2013 we expect net sales of between $14.5 billion and $16.2 billion, a growth of between 13% and 26%. This guidance anticipates approximately 275 basis points of unfavourable impact on foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between a $340 million loss and $10 million income compared to $107 million income in the prior year period. This includes approximately $340 million for stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets.
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and, other operating expense to be between zero and $350 million compared to $360 million in the prior year period. We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection, and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
Thanks. With that, Sean, let's move to questions.
Sean Boyle
Great. Thanks Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Certainly. (Operator Instructions) And our first question today will come from analyst Brian Pitz with Jefferies.
Brian Pitz - Jefferies
In February, you changed your FBA fulfilment fees. Any comments on how this affected third-party sales and what was the overall merchant response? And then just quickly any update on your latest plans for new fulfilment centers in 2013?
Tom Szkutak
In terms of -- I will take the second part of the question first, in terms of new fulfilment centers, we’ve announced three in the US right now and then a few outside of the US consistent with the prior year. It’s early -- we really like the growth that we are experiencing. We will be adding more of these through the course of the year but stay tuned, we will update you as we go.
In terms of FBA, there’s not a lot I can talk to there. We are very pleased with the FBA business and we think it’s great for sellers and great for customers. And we are pleased to offer that service.
Operator
Moving on, we will hear from Scott Devitt of Morgan Stanley.
Scott Devitt - Morgan Stanley
Tom, the international segment sales growth of 21% continues to show modest deceleration I think with the exception of 4Q, it’s been trailing US growth. I understand that AWS is mostly booked in the U.S. so that’s a piece of the delta. But you’ve talked in the past quarters about the investments in international driving margin to at least breakeven levels in international. I wonder if you could just talk through deceleration in the revenue growth in those markets and whether that’s comp related Europe macro or otherwise?
And then secondly, shipping cost on a net basis is again leveraging. I think that’s a second consecutive quarter. I just wonder if you could refresh us in terms of when the accounting change occurred in terms of the shipping revenue calculation for FPA to just understand if that’s an organic number now. Thank you.
Tom Szkutak
The second half of the question, there is -- it is organic. So there is no -- it’s consistent year-over-year. So this is the first quarter. It will be consistent year-over-year. In terms of your question, international, we’re seeing still very solid growth, 21% on a local currency basis. As you’ve read, certainly there is some softness from a macro standpoint that others are saying are hard to know whether that’s impacting us and how much we’re not a bellwether for the economy.
But we’re very pleased with the growth that we’re seeing. Again 21% on a local currency basis, unit growth is actually growing substantially faster than that. So again that’s what we’re seeing. In terms of investing, you’re absolutely right.
We’re investing in a number of geographies including certainly China. We’ve been investing for several years. We continue to invest there. We think it's a great long-term opportunity but we’re in investment mode. And certainly some of the more recent additions that we’ve had with Italy and Spain are certainly in investment mode as well.
Scott Devitt - Morgan Stanley
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Moving on, we will take a question from Mark Mahaney of RBC capital Markets.
Mark Mahaney - RBC capital Markets
Thanks. It’s just a broad question on demand that’s kind of mid-teens at the low-end revenue growth that you’ve been, kind of, guiding too for, a quarter or two now that we’ve seen well below the -- the average that you’ve seen in the past. Are there any other factors you would want to call out or specifically not call out?
Do you think that things like imposition of state sales tax are having in near-term drag on growth rates. Last quarter, I think you talked about consumer electronics at the high-end. Are there any particular categories there you would want to call out as maybe driving that low -- that could produce low-end of the range outside of negative FX? Thanks.
Tom Szkutak
Sure. We give -- as we’re consistently doing, we’re giving a wide range. We think it’s appropriate, given all the factors that’s not something new that we’re doing. That’s something that have been doing for some time in your right -- growth rate guidance for Q2 is 13% to 26% certainly foreign exchange having an impact that includes approximately 275 basis points of foreign exchange. So it’s approximately 16% to 29% on a local currency basis.
So again it’s a wide range and just probably not a lot to add there but it takes into account all the things that we think we need to take into account as we give guidance. In terms of the absolute dollar range, it’s very similar to what we would have -- in terms of the dollar range we would have given for Q1. I think it’s maybe $100 million difference in terms of the absolute value of that range that we gave. So again wide range, we think that’s appropriate.
Mark Mahaney - RBC capital Markets
Thank you.
Operator
Our next question today will come from Ben Schachter of Macquarie.
Ben Schachter - Macquarie
Are there any factors that are impacting the unit growth, particularly the shift from physical to digital, for instance rented video versus purchasing of video. Are there any other factors that you would highlight that are impacting the unit growth?
Tom Szkutak
The one factor, I would call out, first of all in terms of overall unit growth. Overall unit growth is 30% year-over-year. Again, very solid growth, compares to approximately 49% of Q1 of last year. So it’s certainly -- we’re certainly overlapping a pretty strong growth of last Q1.
In terms of the physical and digital, certainly one thing that we’re seeing is certainly digital growing at a much faster rate. And when you do see that, a little bit is in our third-party units as a percentage of total units. You will see that, that’s approximately 40% this quarter. That compares to last year up about approximately 100 basis points. But what we’re seeing is because the digital units are growing at a faster rate and that mostly first party you're seeing that number impacted where that percentage as a percentage of our total is not growing as fast as it has last few quarter. Again that's largely driven by the digital units growth that you are seeing.
So again that’s -- if you were to back out, for example, and just look at our physical units, our physical units as a percentage of total units this year versus last year is up over 300 basis points. That’s again 3p growth as a percentage of total units.
Operator
Our next question today comes from Ross Sandler, Deutsche Bank.
Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank
Question on the -- follow-up question on the shipping, so just your net shipping costs, not your shipping margin, but just shipping costs relative to gross profit declined about 300 basis points, similar to what you have seen over the past four quarters. So as you start to comp some of these efficiency gains that you are seeing in shipping, do you think that line will continue to show leverage or is it going to start to level out from here?
Tom Szkutak
We are not giving -- certainly we’re not giving guidance on any specific line item but certainly over a long period of time we think there is opportunity to be more productive there, and there are certainly efficiency gains to be had there. And that’s something, certainly the team continues to work on.
Operator
Next, we will hear from Colin Sebastian of Robert W. Baird & Company.
Colin Sebastian - Robert W. Baird
Just a question on what services -- wonder if you can comment on enterprise level adoption, whether there are any meaningful barriers to that happening over time. We notice you’ve been pretty aggressive in hiring enterprise-level sales people?
Tom Szkutak
No, I don’t think that there is. I think the team has done a fantastic job in terms of developing services that are great for many different customer types, including enterprises. And the team is heads down focused on making sure we have a great operational of these services that are great from an operational standpoint and security standpoint and they are doing a terrific job. And so it’s a very great opportunity for enterprises to adopt our services and the team is certainly focused on that along with other customers. So other customers that took in, it's a great opportunity for those customers and for us.
Operator
Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan.
Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan
You’ve clearly been more aggressive in terms of video content recently and you are sort of leading, was it more in the release tonight in terms of the business content. I was hoping you could just add some more color here on the value that you think TV and movie content adds to consumers’ overall purchase patterns?
Tom Szkutak
Sure. It’s certainly one of our digital offerings and we have a number of different services. We have certainly content that we’re using as part of our prime offer that we have a lot of free content of the customers. We think that's a great service to customers along with our express shipping offers as well as other content that we have free, for example, our Kindle owners lending library for books. So again, we think it’s a great -- finds a great value for customers and it’s part of that value proposition. We also have in a very good transaction business for video as well. That’s growing very, very fast and certainly customers like it. We are seeing that reflected in the result that you see today.
Operator
Moving on, we will hear from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Mr. Post, your line is open. Please go ahead with your question.
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch
Sorry about that. I was on mute. I was wondering if you can help us little bit about the Kindle ecosystem. On prior calls a few years ago, you singled it out as a fast growth area and you were very happy with the performance. We haven't heard as much about it lately. Kind of the impact -- sort of how units are doing against your expectations and then the impact it’s having on prime subs and also your growth in operating margins? Thank you.
Tom Szkutak
We are very pleased with Kindle and digital business. And we are superexcited in terms of the ecosystem. You're certainly seeing that in our results that you see today. For example, if you look at our media growth, we are certainly -- that ecosystem is more penetrated there than it is in international and you see that reflected in those associated growth rates.
Another way you see it is, if you take a look at our top 10 best-selling items worldwide in Q1. The top 10 are all either digital or Kindle related. Paperweight is our best selling product worldwide. But again, all 10 spots in the Q1 were either Kindle or digital items. And I believe that that's the first time that we’ve seen.
We've been looking at that from a quarterly results standpoint for some period of time, and we’ve had various levels of the top 10. But I think this maybe the first quarter we’ve had all top 10 being either Kindle related or digital related. So again, we are very pleased with what we were doing there and we are going to continue to innovate on behalf of customers.
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch
And any impact on your gross or operating margins you recall?
Tom Szkutak
One thing I would say is we certainly are investing, certainly in area of investment and you're seeing that reflected. We are making a number of investments across the business and certainly we are investing in Kindle and our digital offerings. We are investing in some of the things I mentioned earlier like China or some of the emerging geographies. So those are certainly some of the larger key investments we are making.
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch
Thank you.

Moving on, we will hear from Matt Nemer of Wells Fargo Securities.
Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities
Afternoon. We are hearing reports that there is refrigeration equipment going in some of your fulfillment centers outside of Seattle area. Just wondering if you can update us on plans to expand AmazonFresh. Thanks.
Tom Szkutak
Nothing to announce here. We are very pleased with what we've seen in the Seattle area. But against, it’s been a test and we continue to monitor that test carefully. It’s certainly something that we see that customers love the experience. The challenge has always been in making sure we get the economics right and that is something we will continued to focus on.
Operator
And up next, we will take a question from Steven Ju of Credit Suisse.
Steven Ju - Credit Suisse
Hey. Tom, anything you can say in terms of how much Amazon has done video as well as potentially your own in-house produced content currently helps and will -- should in the future help reduce churn in Amazon Prime? Thanks.
Tom Szkutak
Thanks for the question. Yeah. It’s something we haven't released any of the numbers. It’s something that we are tracking very closely. It is something that we believe over time will reduce churn and it’s certainly helping today. What we are seeing is great traction. We see a lot of usage of the service.
Customers love it and we think it is very interesting part of Prime offering. And that’s why we have been expanding NYC, some of the more recent announcement including some of the stuff included in the earnings release today around original content So, again, it’s something that we find very interesting and we are excited about it.
Operator
And we will go next to Ken Sena of Evercore Partners with our next question.
Ken Sena - Evercore Partners
Hi. I was just hoping you can maybe provide a little more color on the unit growth deceleration. And looking back over the last four quarters, it seems like about 500 basis points or so each quarter of deceleration. You had about 200 basis points here, which is an improvement. But anything you could say just to any signs of maturity in some of the business anywhere that deceleration is specifically coming?
Tom Szkutak
No, there is not a lot I can add. I mean I think the 30% book, very strong growth rate. Again it’s growing at a faster rate than revenue, revenue at 20%, revenue at local currency growth of 24%, a very strong third-party growth continues to be very strong. Retail growth is strong. So again there is not a lot I can provide you there. But again keep in mind that we are overlapping 49% growth last year Q1, which is certainly little bit of a difficult compare but again fees would be 30% growth rate.
Operator
And our next question today comes from John Blackledge, Cowen & Company.
John Blackledge - Cowen & Company
Just a question on the Amazon advertising platform, given the immense amount of purchase ad you have on Amazon customers, how is that being used as a competitive advantage and maybe you just provide an overall view on the direction of the Amazon ad platform over time?
Tom Szkutak
In terms of the platform itself, we think it's a very sizable, very good long-term opportunity for us. And it’s something that we’ve been working on for some time and we think it’s very interesting. One thing you'll notice, on our site we’re being obviously very -- making sure the customer experience is great. What we are really trying to do is we are trying to help customers find and discover what they want to buy online. So we’re and it’s very customer centric but it’s also from a business standpoint of very good long-term opportunity with great team that’s working on the opportunity. And we’re excited about the long term potential of it.
Operator
Moving on to Anthony Diclemente of Barclays.
Anthony Diclemente - Barclays
I am just wondering what you are seeing in terms of the attach rate of your transactional video on demand business versus usage of PrimeInstant Video. I am wondering just if your consumers tend to choose between the two, when they are making the selection or there’s one sort of drives the other, does the Prime subscriber have a higher transactional VOD attach rates than non-Prime? So would be helpful to see -- to hear what you're seeing there in terms of usage?
Tom Szkutak
Yeah, I think the thing that can help with this, we see -- of Prime customers, for example, we certainly see adoption of the service in terms of free content but those same customers are purchasing content as well. So there is a good attachment to it which we like. And we see Prime members doing not just within video content but we see them doing a lot of cross-shopping. So it’s not surprising we see them do, maybe a customer comes in, and had been traditionally purchasing them pre-Prime, in a few categories, we find that they do a lot more cross-shopping. Same thing with digital content. They use the service, they might start with free content and then they will also continue to purchase paid content. So it’s a nice effect that we’re seeing, which is why we like Prime so much.
Operator
Up next, we will hear from Youssef Squali of Cantor Fitzgerald.
Youssef Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald
Two quick questions please. Going back to the international, a question, what’s going on in the international media to decelerate, I think last year Q1 I think it was up 22%, FX adjusted this quarter was up 7%. Is that all macro or are there any maybe other factors that you can talk about, maybe specific to SKUs or something? And the other is more of a clarification. I know last quarter you gave the unit growth in aggregate versus the unit growth of the retail, just wondering if you could give that to us as well?
Tom Szkutak
In terms of the international media growth, this quarter it was 1% on a dollar basis, 7% on a local currency basis, which you -- in terms of the overall growth rate certainly what you’re seeing is digital content as part of that is growing very fast. But it’s not as large or as penetrated. Our ecosystem isn’t as developed I would say as it is in the U.S. And so when you compare the two geographies for second that’s one of the more meaningful differences that you see between the two as you see that both are growing digital content very fast.
It is just the ecosystem is more build out in North America. But again, certainly we see very positive signs back in the growth we’re experiencing in international. It’s just on the lower base. So that’s began to be helpful there.
In terms of the unit growth, we said that our overall unit growth was 30% for the quarter. Our 3P unit growth I don’t have the overall growth rate but it’s growing at a faster rate than the total.
Operator
And our next question today will come from Jordan Rohan of Stifel.
Jordan Rohan - Stifel
Yeah. I was hoping you could comment on the market entry and expansion strategy for Amazon in Brazil. There seemed to be tremendous amount of press last year about it and it seems to have died to some degree. I know the company may already be there with Amazon Web Services and some Kindle offerings. But when do you think that might get a little bit broader?
And secondly, there's been some stories recently about an Internet streaming device or box or set-top box, something of those sorts. Can you comment on any new hardware form factors including apps as of some sort of a cell phone or handset that might be coming down the pipe, anything to look forward to in the Kindle family or related? Thanks.
Tom Szkutak
In terms of geographic expansion, there is not a lot I can say specifically about Brazil. We think we are in the right geographies right now. We’ve expanded into a number of geographies over the past few years. That is certainly something always we look at and you should expect us to expand to additional geographies over time.
In terms of any questions related to our product roadmap, we don’t -- we’ve a longstanding practices of not talking about what we might, or might not do there. But we are certainly excited about the product roadmap that we have for the future and again, we’ve a longstanding practice of not giving details until closer at launch.
Operator
And ladies and gentlemen, we do have time for one final question today. That question will come from Jason Helfstein of Oppenheimer & Company.
Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Company
Thanks. Can you give us a little more color around customer growth? I mean, that number has been slowing not dramatically, but that is a slowing trend. Are you focused more on higher value customers to drive the business and any color around the quarter would be helpful? Thanks.
Tom Szkutak
We're actually pleased with the growth from a customer standpoint. We've seen very good growth and we continue to -- we have many, many teams across Amazon that are just heads down focused on trying to improve the customer experience and inventing on behalf of customers. So, we couldn't be more pleased with what they are doing, and you see that reflected in our overall growth rate this quarter with revenue up 24% on a local currency basis and units growing at 30%, on top of strong growth quarter last year Q1.
Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Company
Thank you.
Tom Szkutak
Great.

Good day everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com fourth quarter 2012 financial results teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.
For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Sean Boyle. Please go ahead.
Sean Boyle
Hello and welcome to our Q4 2012 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, January 29, 2013 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K.
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2011. Now, I will turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas Szkutak
Thanks, Sean. I will begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12 month operating cash flow increased 7% to $4.81 billion. Trailing 12 month free cash flow decreased 81% to $395 million. Trailing 12 months capital expenditures were $3.79 billion.
This amount includes $1.4 billion in purchases of our previously leased corporate office space as well as property for development of additional corporate office space located in Seattle, Washington which we purchased in the fourth quarter. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth consisting of investing in technology infrastructure including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
Return on invested capital was 4%, down from 22%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 470 million shares compared with 460 million shares one year ago.
Worldwide revenue grew 22% to $21.27 billion or 23% excluding the $178 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. We are grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers. Media revenue increased to $6.51 billion, up 8% or 10% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $13.93 billion, up 28% or 29% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 65% of worldwide sales, up from 63%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 32%. Active customer accounts exceeded 200 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 39% of paid units.
Now, I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $16.14 billion, or 75.9% of revenue, compared with 79.3%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content in G&A combined was $4.45 billion, or 20.9% of sales, up approximately 293 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $2.2 billion, or 10.3% of revenue compared with 9.3%. Tech and content was $1.22 billion, or 5.7% of revenue, compared with 4.5%. Marketing was $833 million, or 3.9% of revenue compared with 3.3%.
Now, I'll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate segments, our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 23% to $12.17 billion. Media revenue grew 13% to $2.9 billion. EGM revenue grew 24% to $8.5 billion, representing 70% of North America revenues, up from 69%. North America segment operating income increased 114% to $608 million, a 5% operating margin.
In the international segment, revenue grew 21% to $9.09 billion. Adjusting for the hundred $83 million year-over-year unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, revenue growth was 23%. Media revenue grew 5% to $3.61 billion, or 7% excluding foreign exchange and EGM revenue grew 35% to $5.43 billion, or 37% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 60% of international revenues, up from 54%.
International segment operating income decreased 61% to $70 million a, 0.8% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, International segment operating income decreased 56%.
CSOI increased 47% to $678 million, or 3.2% of revenue, up approximately 54 basis points year-over-year. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating. GAAP operating income increased 56% to $405 million, or 1.9% of net sales.
Our income tax expense was $194 million in Q4, resulting in a 58% rate for the quarter and 79% rate for the full year 2012. GAAP net income was $97 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, compared with $177 million and $0.38 per diluted share.
Now, I will discuss the full year results. Revenue grew 27% to $61.0 9 billion. North America revenue grew 30% $34.81 billion and International revenue grew 23% to $26.28 billion, or 27% growth excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange.
Consolidated segment operating income or CSOI increased 6% to $1.67 billion, or 7% excluding the unfavorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange and operating margin decreased 54 basis points, 2.7%. GAAP operating income decreased 22% to $676 million, or 1.1% of net sales.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $1.87 billion year-over-year to $11.45 billion. Inventory increased 21% to $6.03 billion and inventory turns were 9.3, down from 10.3 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 20% to $13.32 billion and accounts payable days increased to 76 from 74 in the prior year.
In Q4 2012, we usually $3 billion of senior non-convertible unsecured debt in three, five and seven-year tranches with proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes. I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance.
Incorporated into the guidance are the order trends that we have seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending.
It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material impact on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don’t conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments or settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.
For Q1 2013, we expect net sales of between $15 billion and $16.6 billion or growth between 14% and 26%. This guidance anticipates approximately 122 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between the $285 million loss and $65 million positive income compared to $192 million income in the prior period year.
This includes approximately $285 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income which excludes stock-based compensation and other expense to be between zero and $350 million compared to $390 million income in the prior period.
We remain head sound focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
Thanks for that. Sean, let's go to questions
Sean Boyle
Great, thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.
Scott Devitt - Morgan Stanley
Tom, it looks that you have successfully begin the transition of your logistics costs in the direction of being more of a fixed fulfillment cost with lower unit based shipping costs, given that the growth rate of about shipping now meaningfully below the fulfillment growth rate. So the question is, is this something that we should expect to continue now in the back of this meaningful fulfillment center expansion ramp?
Then separately, but on the same topic, we are also wondering, are there other parts of the business in which you can make this transition to more of a fixed cost in the future? Thanks.
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of the fulfillment question, you are right in terms of over the past few years, we have expanded in our fulfillment network pretty extensively to the point where we are closer to customers and you are seeing that reflected in our transportation cost, you can obviously see the fulfillment expense is certainly not fixed in terms of absolute terms but you can see that we had 20 fulfillment centers last year and that’s reflected in the operating expense that you are seeing. But that is a benefit of having adding to our fulfillment center network. We get closer and closer to customers with a lot of great selection. So you are seeing that reflected in the individual of business gross margins, which shows up as benefits of transportation cost.
In terms of other opportunities, certainly there are a number of opportunities as we invest in individual customer experience areas across the business. Many of those would be on our website. We have a relatively fixed expense as we launch those and we amortize those costs over our full customer base. So as they grow to become more effective on a per unit or per customer basis. So there is a number of opportunities that we have had and will have going forward to do that.
Operator
Thank you. We will take our next question from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.
Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan
Great, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask about the shift to third-party, I guess in particularly, I think last 4Q you talked about shifting more the business in the videogame space, in particular the third-party categories that you would specifically point to in this last 4Q, you already made sort of a similar shift. Thanks.
Thomas Szkutak
We did see, you know, a good expansion as you mentioned in 3P, a third-party units as a percentage of total units increased from 36% last year Q4 to 39% on expansion of approximately 300 basis points. Our overall unit growth rate for the quarter in total was 32%. Our third-party growth rate was in excess of 40%, so, again, nice growth. You are certainly seeing it in a number of areas.
You see it certainly in our EGM business look. If you look at our North America growth rates are unique and see that our revenues, up 23% but our third-party, our total unit growth rate was a substantially faster than that, and our third-party units were growing very fast there as well, so there's a number of differently that you are seeing that, but certainly you are seeing it there.
Operator
Thank you. We'll take our next question Brian Pitz with Jefferies.
Brian Pitz - Jefferies
Great. Thanks. Looks like you are moving more in the direction of same-day shipping. Would you provide any thoughts or insights here? Should we anticipate a significant ramp-up of fulfillment center build out, particularly in Q2, Q3? And, maybe, if you could just comment more generally on your FC built out plans U.S. versus international? Thanks.
Thomas Szkutak
There is not a lot I can comment on in terms of our plans similar to last year no as we progress through the year, we can give you further updates on what we plan to do there. Last year, we opened up 20 new fulfillment centers, and so we saw in a very rapid growth in fulfillment capacity last year, and stay tuned and we'll let you know more as the year progress there.
Operator
We'll go next to Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets
Thanks. Two questions please. The paid unit growth deceleration to 32% there seems a bit of a disconnect versus an active customer growth that didn't decelerated as much on a per customer basis, are you seeing some sort of change in overall activity. Is that the impact of newer international markets?
Then just on the investment cycle, the last couple of calls, you've consistently called out future investments whether the $1.4 billion for Seattle or distribution center expansion. You didn't do it this quarter I don't over read into it, but does that we are at the end of a major investment cycle? Thanks.
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of unit growth, there's not a lot more I can add to it. We did see very strong, we saw substantially unit growth and revenue growth in terms of the paid unit growth in Q4 unit, which we are seeing very strong third-party growth as well, was up over 40%.
In terms of investment cycle, I wouldn't read into anything related to that. We will still be adding capacity during 2013 in terms of the levels of how much we'll add. As I mentioned earlier in the call, just stay tuned and we will let you know as the year progresses.
Operator
We'll go next to Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.
Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs
Great, thanks. I was wondering if you give us just a bit of a sense of what you are seeing as you the rollout fulfillment centers into new state. Obviously the sales tax issue has been that's come up a good bit, but you touched on the impact of being closer with faster delivery in those same state. Net-net, what do you see as being the impact on not asking you to give us kind of a state by state breakdown, but the impact of rolling out the fulfillment center footprint taking both of those things into accounts.
Thomas Szkutak
I am not really sure how best to answer your question. I mean, we certainly have expanded pretty dramatically over the past really coming out of 2009 between 2010, 2011 and 2012. We've rapidly increase our footprint globally. Your comment was more directed towards the U.S., but we have also rapidly increased our footprint in the U.S.
As a result of that, your book category selection, a much broader selection closer to customers as you would expect with this rapid increase. We have also expanded selection during that time period. So we continue to be in the locations we would like to be in and we will continue to expand our footprint over time and become even closer and closer to customers. Beyond that there is not a lot I can add.
Operator
We will go next to Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.
Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray
Good afternoon. Some high level query minus the margin difference between 1P and 3P. I know in the past you talked about you being agnostic between the two but the growth in 3P and what your CSOI margins imply that 3P has little bit higher margin. Is that the correct read through? Thanks.
Thomas Szkutak
There is some variation by business but certainly that we attempt to do as from my pricing standpoint, is to try to be agnostic. That is really how we run the business. Again, this is on a third-party versus retail. Then, we have also added certainly a lot of other services over the past year in terms of fulfillment. So it really depends upon where we are in the investment cycle, what our utilization is.
As you know, certainly as you look at the last few years, we have been in very heavily expanding in terms of fulfillment capacity because of the growth that we have been experiencing that certainly would put pressure on our overall cost structure. Certainly as a per unit basis because we are not giving the productivity. We don’t get the full productivity for a number of years after expanding.
So depending on what type of customer is, you know, whether it is a retail unit, a straight third-party units or NFPA unit but again we are certainly attempting this on a product basis to be roughly agnostic.
Operator
We will go next to Brian Nowak with Nomura.
Brian Nowak - Nomura
Thanks, guys. First, on the device strategy with Kindle and Kindle HD, can you help us at all what you are seeing with the attach rate trend on digital goods after people buy the Kindles. Then generally, do you see a higher overall GMV per customer on Kindle devices than users on Amazon Apps through other devices?
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of attach rates, we haven’t given a lot of detail but I think one thing certainly to look at, and it doesn’t give any attach rate, but it gives you at least a sense of the health of the business, the number that was in the release today. We sure have a multi-billion-dollar e-book business, growing approximately 70% year-over-year, total year last year. That’s growing at that rate after really just launching the business approximately five years ago. So it’s a pretty good healthy growth rate five years in.
We are seeing good, I can't give you specific numbers but we have seen very good progress on a number of our other digital media categories. Video, I talked about a little bit earlier, we are seeing Prime customers. Certainly the percentage of Prime customers who were watching free content through Prime Instant Videos has gone up dramatically year-over-year.
We have also increased Prime membership dramatically, year-over-year. They are also purchasing a paid content. Those customers that are using this, they watch free but they are also paying for new content which is great.
We have launched a number of new services on the music side. Most recently, our CD with free MP3, which we have on many titles. It's still very early but we certainly like that service and pleased to offer to customers. So I can't give you specific for attach rates but the business is making good progress on the video content side. Again it's still very early.
Operator
We will go next to Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank
Thanks, guys. Just two quick questions. As you guys build out the Prime membership and the fees available through FBA, you run into this challenge of increase in your unit volume of tail items and at the same time we need to get products to customers in much shorter shipping cycle. So, can you talk about how the new fulfillments helps on that front? Is your reliance on air going down as a percent of total items shipped. Then if I remember correctly, you guys reclassified some FBA revenue in early 2012. Can you just remind how that flows through the shipping revenue line and what could happened as you count that in the beginning of '13. Thanks.
Thomas Szkutak
Sure. Just in terms of overall selection, as we added to Prime, what I was talking about earlier in terms of having a more expanded footprint is, there's no unit question that's helping us add additional selection more economically to Prime. And so on, that's both in terms of third-party selection as well as our retail selection and so that's something that we know continue to have the benefit of as we get more and more members in Prime and have the bigger, bigger concentration of two-day shipping U.S. for that.
So, we did add the shipping portion FBA fees in Q1 of 2012 and we see some benefit year-over-year, but we are still seeing leverage in terms of, you know, ex the FBA fees quite a bit leverage there, so we I do not have a specific number for you there, but yes we are still seeing quite a bit of leverage there, ex the re-class that you are referring to.
Operator
We'll go next to Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch
Great. Thank you. Last year you reported 4Q in the lower half of revenue range and you were able to call out Taiwan and video games category. Any reasons why revenues were kind of in the lower half this quarter?
And then if you look at gross profit growth, it clearly has accelerated to 40% growth, but unit growth decelerated to 32%.Can you describe what's driving that kind of accelerating gross profit in the face of lower unit growth, and is it possible maybe you are letting the third parties handle some of the many less profitable categories for Amazon. Could you talk about that all? Thank you.
Thomas Szkutak
If you take a look at our growth rate, where we think the growth rate for Q4 was solid. It was up 23% on revenue basis quite a bit higher than on a unit growth basis up 32% year-over-year. In terms of some of the things that we saw and we again we saw solid growth across many different categories and geographies year-over-year.
Certainly some things to call out in terms of things that may have been a little bit softer. A few examples would be, we did see some of the higher average selling price items, particularly the items greater than $1,000 a little bit softer, a few of the consumer electronics, you subcategories like TVs, MP3 players digital cameras to some extent were softer. But, again, with the base that we have in Q4, still very solid growth.
Another one, certainly we are thrilled to have a Paperwhite in our lineup best e-reader that's out there and we are very pleased with it, but we couldn't keep up with demand. We would have had more sales in Q4 for able to keep up with demand and so the team is working very hard to make sure we have good in-stock going forward on that product, but we certainly could have sold more in Q4.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Tom Forte with Telsey Advisory Group.
Tom Forte - Telsey Advisory Group
Great. Thanks very much for taking my question. I want to ask you on Amazon Instant Video, how you thought about your current offering and your ability to add exclusive content in a cost effective manner through Amazon Studios, and what the relationship is between adding more titles and uses on your hardware such your Amazon Kindle devices? Thanks.
Thomas Szkutak
We will continue to expand our selection, both in terms of Amazon Instant Video as well Prime Instant Video and we will do that in a number of different ways. We think we have a very interesting selection right now and you should expect that will be spending more on content as it relates to Prime over time. We will continue to add selection on the Instant Video. Beyond that, you have to stay tuned.
Operator
We will go next to Ken Sena with Evercore Partners.
Ken Sena - Evercore Partners
Hi, I just had a question on your other segment line. Can you talk a little bit about the non-AWS drivers within that line as you are advertising? As you look out, are there advantages to you in terms of having AWS as far as offering things like buying, serving, analytics through the AWS platform to advertisers? Where are you in that rollout phase now? Thank you.
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of the AWS business, the business is growing very fast. We have increased the number of services pretty dramatically over the past several years. The team is doing a fantastic job there. We will continue to innovate on behalf of customers in that space. There is a number of other things that go into that line item. Some are credit card as well as other marketing revenue goes in there. But again, AWS is in that line item.
Operator
We will go next to Anthony Diclemente with Barclays.
Anthony Diclemente - Barclays
Hi, thanks. I wondered if you gave comment on the pace of business throughout the fourth quarter? Did you see a particular deceleration in the month of December? Then second question, on international, I am wondering, are there any call outs in terms of specific countries that may have been weighing on profitability? Countries where there is going to be outsized dollars of investment going on or accelerated investment at the current time. Thank you.
Thomas Szkutak
There are not a lot of specifics. We have long been in the practice of not talking about trends in within the quarter in terms of year-over-year growth or anything like that. Obviously the Q4 is very seasonal. December is, by far, the largest the month followed by November but in terms of individual growth rates, we don’t have a lot of comments there.
In terms of international, yes, there certainly are geographies that we are investing in heavily. Certainly China would be one. Some of the European countries including some of the new launches that we are investing in. Those are certainly, you are seeing those represented in those segment results.
Operator
We will take our next question from Rohit Kulkarni with Citi.
Rohit Kulkarni - Citi
Okay, thank you for taking my question. In terms of your recent margin profile, actually comparing U.S. and international, I guess over the past four quarters, the vast majority improvement or rather the less worse margin trends that we have seen have been due to U.S. margins improving while international were declining in the range of 300 to 350 basis points. In Q4, international declined just 160 basis points. So my questions, should we read this as a beginning of a trend that we saw how domestic margins increased over the last four quarters and whether international should follow similar route over the next foreseeable future.
Thomas Szkutak
Yes, there is not a particular call out that I could make on that. The only thing that I would, in terms of the change I am referring to, but in terms of the difference between two, keep in mind that, a couple of factors. One, mix of business is a little bit different. Our AWS businesses is in North America segment. You also have some newer geographies. Or geography that I shouldn’t say are necessarily newer but geographies that we are investing in heavily that have a longer-term horizon for returns, the ones I mentioned earlier. So those are factors as you look at the two different segments.
Operator
We will take our next question from Benjamin Schachter with Mcquarrie.
Benjamin Schachter - Mcquarrie
It looks likes the first-party gross margin is actually up fairly meaningful year-over-year. Wonder if you could talk about that within the context of Amazon Kindle hardware is impacting the gross margin. Then separately just any view on how videogames sales impact to the year-over-year growth rate for the quarter? Thanks.
Thomas Szkutak
Yes. It causes we haven't broken out the first-party versus third-party units since it's something we have done for that's only I am today or we have done in previous calls, so it's not I can help you with there.
Operator
We will take our next question from Jordan Rohan with Stifel Nicolaus
Jordan Rohan - Stifel Nicolaus
First just an accounting clarification, it should be pretty interesting, but the content cost for Prime Instant Video flowing to the cost of goods line even there is no direct revenue associated not into the tech and content line, right? Is that right?
Thomas Szkutak
That's correct.
Jordan Rohan - Stifel Nicolaus
Okay. So, gross margins would be even higher if those costs were included elsewhere or broken out separately? It also seems like it's becoming a separate question. It's something kind of common or to reduce the carrying value of your investment in LivingSocial. Give a feel on a broad strategic level as to whether the local deals business through Amazon local or through LivingSocial is something that you care to keep investing in? Thanks.
Thomas Szkutak
There's not a lot I can specifically talk about as it relates to LivingSocial beyond, what's on our result today and what we'll have in our 10-K, which we filed soon, and so I would encourage you take a look at in our full disclosures related to that. But in terms of local, there certainly is still a very interesting opportunity there. We do have a couple, we have an investment in LivingSocial, we also have a local business ourselves.
So, it's an interesting opportunity, it's a long-term opportunity in and we will continue to work on that customers to make that experience even better and you should think about it, not unlike a lot of the other businesses that we invest in with over long-term horizon and it's not very early there.
Sean Boyle
Okay. Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on investor relations website at least through the end of the quarter.

Good day everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Third Quarter 2012 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today’s call is being recorded.
For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Sean Boyle. Please go ahead.
Sean Boyle
Hello and welcome to our Q3 2012 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management’s views as of today, October 25, 2012 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today’s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today’s conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.
During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You’ll find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2011. Now, I will turn the call over to Tom.
Tom Szkutak
Thanks, Sean. I’ll begin with comments on our third quarter financial results. Trailing 12 month operating cash flow increased 8% to $3.37 billion. Trailing 12 month free cash flow decreased 31% to $1.06 billion. Return on invested capital was 10%, down from 17%. ROIC trailing 12 month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter end.
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 469 million shares consistent with 469 million shares. Worldwide revenue grew 27% to $13.81 billion or 30% excluding the $348 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. We’re grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers.
Media revenue increased to $4.6 billion, up 11% or 14% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $8.56 billion up 36% or 39% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 62% of worldwide sales, up from 58%.
Worldwide paid unit growth was 39%. Active customer accounts exceeded $188 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than $2 million. Seller units represented 41% of paid units.
Now, I’ll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $10.32 billion or 74.7% of revenue compared with 76.5%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $3.26 billion or 23.6% of sales, up approximately 251 basis points year-over-year.
Fulfillment was $1.45 billion or 10.5% of revenue compared with 10%. Tech and content was $1.08 billion or 7.8% of revenue compared with 6.4%. Marketing was $524 million or 3.8% of revenue compared with 3.3%.
Now, I’ll talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods we do not allocate the segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 33% to $7.88 billion. Media revenue grew 15% to $2.22 billion. EGM revenue grew 39% to $5.06 billion, representing 64% of North America revenues, up from 61%. North America segment operating income increased to 102% to $291 million, a 3.7% operating margin.
In the International segment, revenue grew 20% to $5.92 billion, adjusting for the $347 million unfavorable foreign exchange impact revenue growth was 27%. Media revenue grew 7% to $2.38 billion or 12% excluding foreign exchange. And EGM revenue grew 30% to $3.5 billion or 39% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 59% of international revenues up from 54%.
International segment operating loss was $59 million, a 1% negative operating margin compared with income of $116 million. CSOI decreased 11% to $232 million or 1.7% of revenue, down approximately 71 basis points year-over-year, excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased to 10%.
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income or loss includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating loss was $28 million or 0.2% negative operating margin comparing with GAAP operating income of $79 million.
Our income tax expense was $83 million. GAAP net loss was $274 million or $0.60 per diluted share compared with net income of $63 million and $0.14 per diluted share.
Third quarter 2012 includes a loss of $169 million, $0.37 per diluted share related to our equity-method share of losses reported by LivingSocial, primarily attributable to its impairment charge of certain assets, including goodwill. As of the end of September the book value of our equity-method investment in LivingSocial was $94 million.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities decreased $1.08 billion year-over-year to $5.25 billion. Inventory increased 34% to $5.07 billion and inventory turns were 9.7, down from 10.8 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories.
Accounts payable increased 28% to $8.37 billion and accounts payable days increased to 75 from 72 in the prior year. Our Q3 2012 capital expenditures were $716 million.
The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
I’ll conclude my portion of today’s call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we’ve to-date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumption.
Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by factors including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It’s not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance.
Our guidance further assumes that we don’t conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments or settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they’ve been recently.
For Q4 2012, we expect net sales of between $20.25 billion and $22.75 billion, a growth of between 16% and 31%. This guidance anticipates approximately 45 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates.
GAAP operating income or loss to be between $490 million loss to $310 million income compared to $260 million income in the prior year. This includes approximately $290 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between a $200 million loss and $600 million income compared to $462 million income in the prior year period.
We expect capital expenditures for ongoing operations including capitalized software development to be approximately $0.9 billion to $1.0 billion. These anticipated investments are driven primarily by our expectations of continued business growth consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
We expect additional capital expenditures of approximately $1.4 billion related to the purchase of our currently leased corporate office space as well as property for development of additional corporate office space located in Seattle, Washington. We remain head-sound focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
Thanks. With that Sean, let’s move to questions.
Sean Boyle

Great. Thanks, Tom. Let’s move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes form Scott Devitt, Morgan Stanley.
Scott Devitt - Morgan Stanley

Hi. Thank you. Two please, if I could, Tom. First on international margin, I know some of that actually is affected by currency. I was wondering, if you could speak to the effect of currency that it’s having on margin. And then secondly, what else is driving that down? I would anticipate China investment digital and Italy and Spain being contributors there?
Then secondly on shipping revenue up 44% year-over-year I was wondering if you could break that down between shipping revenue or more versus the revenue allocation of FBA? Thanks.
Tom Szkutak
To take the first part of your question Scott, as it relates to operating profit in international you have the big pieces correct. First one is, we’re investing certainly very heavily in capacity and so you’re seeing that both fulfillment and infrastructure capacity that’s impacting our results there. In addition to that, we’re investing in the number of new geographies.
We’ve talked about Italy and Spain over the last several calls those are certainly having an impact. We’re very excited about the opportunity that we have there, but certainly those are investments right now. China, as you also mentioned is creating a long-term opportunity for us, but certainly an investment and it is impacting that number.
In addition, one that I don’t think you did mention was video content for international. We’re investing heavily in video content through our subsidiary LOVEFiLM for Europe. So those are things that are the primary drivers of what you’re seeing in operating income in international.
In terms of shipping revenue there is not a lot. I can help you, but there is a number of factors that go into that number. If you take a look at both, the shipping revenue and then the resulting net shipping cost of fuel, the net shipping cost is getting a little bit better. Over time it’s getting closer and closer to customers with our RFC footprint. So those are some of things, but again a lot of dynamics that are certainly impacting that shipping revenue number.
Operator
Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of Citi.
Mark Mahaney - Citi
Great. Thanks. Any comments on the paid unit growth deceleration that seem to have been relatively significant, anything about the comp or any read into that? And secondly, given all the infrastructure investments you’ve made, Tom you just mentioned some of the shipping efficiencies, you’re also seeing fulfillment as a percentage of revenue kind of start narrowing a little bit. Do you think you’ve reached a bit of a cyclical -- investment cyclical tipping point or am, I over reading into just one quarter? Thank you.
Tom Szkutak
In terms of the paid unit growth question, it was 39%. As you mentioned it was a deceleration from last quarter. Keep in mind still, the 39% growth is still growing at a faster rate than revenue, one.
Two, if you take a look at last year’s unit growth in Q3, the 53% that we had, that was the second highest quarter that we’ve had in growth rate in the last 10 years. So we are overlapping a very strong growth last quarter.
In terms of fulfillment expense, certainly as we’ve talked about in the past few years, stepping up very heavily in 2010 and 2011, and ‘12 from a fulfillment standpoint, we’ve just seen unprecedented growth. And we’ve added a lot of capacity, in terms of where it will level off, we’ll have to wait and see.
Right now, we’re still experiencing very strong growth, with 30% growth on a local currency basis, 39% unit growth. So we’re going to continue to invest where we need to and the fulfillment capacity we do have, we’re going to make sure that we operate as efficiently as we can and get more efficient with that capacity over time.
Operator
And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs
Great. Thank you. I had a question about pop-up stores. It seems like a lot of people are jumping on the bandwagon there. And we’ve been hearing stuff recently about Amazon trying to leverage those as a way to get closer to customers, and help facilitate shipping for the holiday season. I’m just wondering if you could share with us your strategy there.
Tom Szkutak
Yeah. Could you elaborate on what you’re referring to? I’m sorry.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs
A pop-up store, meaning something that might only be open for between say, Black Friday and January 1st, a short-term store?
Tom Szkutak
The vast majority or the highest percentage of our revenue is certainly coming from our online sales. We do, in the case of Kindle are using physical world retailers as well, which we’re very happy to do so. But again it’s not really a driver of our business.
Operator
And we’ll take a question now from Douglas Anmuth of J.P. Morgan.
Douglas Anmuth - J.P. Morgan
Thanks for taking the question. Tom, it’s been nearly a year since you launched the First Fire devices. And I was hopping, you could give us a sense of how that cohort of users might be tracking, in terms of their buyer activity and in particular, how you’re seeing them if they are over indexing in terms of media content consumption, Prime usage and overall purchasing? And how do you feel about that strategy now as you continue to tie upon into devices? Thanks.
Tom Szkutak
Maybe the best way to describe it would be, certainly we’re seeing customers certainly purchasing a lot of content. We like the idea of selling our Kindle Fires and then being rewarded through purchases of content going forward. All that being said, even though we’re rewarded with those sales, customers realize that we’re going to make sure that we work on behalf of them to make sure that content is not only very wide but also at great prices.
And so, we continue to work with, to make sure that we can provide on customers behalf. But we’re seeing a very good shopping patterns on all types of content with the selection that we have. We’re seeing customers not only purchase content, we’re seeing Prime customers certainly being active and watching our free content as well and that’s working very well. So it’s a great combination of things that are going on there in engagement with the device.
Operator
And we’ll go next to Youssef Squali of Cantor Fitzgerald.
Youssef Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald
Yeah. Thank you very much. I actually want to follow-up on the question that was just asked. So, intuitively, it really makes a lot of sense what it is that you’re doing. But can you maybe just speak to the effectiveness of selling the device or all these devices is kind of near breakeven?
Maybe is there anticipate metric that you can point to help us understand the lifts you get either in terms of the frequency of buying or listing in average transaction value or anything that could kind of help us gauge from the outside the success of our strategy? And then second, maybe if you could just speak to the thinking behind your content costs related to your streaming service going forward, just how should we be thinking about it? Thank you.
Tom Szkutak
In terms of -- there is not a lot of specifics I can give you on a per device basis from a content standpoint in terms of what the purchasing patterns have been, but as I mentioned in the previous question, certainly customers are engaged in the device they are purchasing content. They all are also, in the case of video, they’re purchasing content as well as watching free content.
In the case of books, they’re purchasing books as well if they’re Prime members. They’re participating in free content. So those are things that are going very well. We like what we see there, which is why we continue to investment in that business, which is why you see the offerings, the very compelling offerings that we have out there right now. So those are things that you should expect us to do more of.
In terms of the content spend, if you’re referring to the – it’s related to Prime Instant Video, I think it’s probably what you’re referring to. We have added a lot of content. We like what we see so far. We’ll continue to monitor it very carefully. You should expect us to add more content going forward.
We launched Prime, some number of years ago now and we had a little over 1 million items at launch. We then expanded that dramatically with many physical items. We’re now offering digital items through Prime as well, most notably in, certainly in books and video and we’re monitoring the performance very closely. But again, so far we’re seeing great new subscribers coming out of these efforts and we like what we see so far.
Operator
And our next question comes from Brian Pitz of Jefferies.
Brian Pitz - Jefferies
Thanks. I know it’s still early but, have you seen any noticeable impact from sales in states like California where they just started lighting you guys up on collecting sales tax?
Tom Szkutak
You’re right. It is early. The only thing I could point to is, we collect in over -- either sales tax or equivalent value-added tax. We collect in over 50% of our revenue today. We have very good businesses in those states and geographies that we do that in long ago. That’s all I can point to today.
Operator
Now, we’ll take our next question from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse.
Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse
So, good afternoon, guys. So revisiting the capacity and infrastructure question overseas, anything you can share in terms of the operating environment and what is required to get the package to the customer?
Over the longer term, are there any particular regions that you think may never reach the efficiency level, as you may currently see in your older geographies? Thank you.
Tom Szkutak
Actually, we feel very good about the investments we’re making in fulfillment capacity. When I think about the types of investments that we’re making in terms of predictability, certainly, I would consider the fulfillment capacity to be more of the running of the business type investments.
We have a lot of experience starting up new facilities, operating those efficiently and to the point where, as you know we’ve extended that not only to offer that service for our retail business, we also offer that to sellers to fulfill by Amazon. So those are things that we feel. Certainly those investments we feel good about but, what you’re seeing is certain just a very large ramp that we’ve done starting in 2010 through now.
And you know it’s one of these investments, we only make those investments where we absolutely need too. But in terms of deploying that capital is those resources, we feel very good about it.
Operator
And we’ll go next to Brian Nowak of Nomura.
Brian Nowak - Nomura
Hi. Thanks. I have two questions, please. Can you talk to what you saw throughout Europe? Did you see any weakening in the European markets throughout the quarter, and if so any comments on specific pockets or countries of weakness?
And then secondly, can you talk a little bit about social and kind of use of social networks like Pinterest? Do you feel comfortable working with other social networks to drive business to Amazon as you are now, or do you think over the long-term or time you like to have more end-to-end control over social e-commerce? Thanks.
Tom Szkutak
In terms of the euro piece, we’re not breaking out any specific countries in terms of growth. But as you can see from the results, we grew 27% in international and local currency basis, which includes obviously our footprint in Europe as well as China and Japan.
So we feel the growth has been in the high-20s to low-30s over the past several quarters. Certainly, we’re reading the same thing that you’re reading in terms of the softness, hard to tell how much that’s impacting us.
Again, when you look at 27% growth rates still think that’s pretty solid and the environment, again hard to tell how much we’re impacting -- impacted by that. In terms of social, we’re certainly very looking at a lot of different ways to reach our customers and certainly that’s an opportunity for us and something that our -- certainly our advertising and marketing teams are very conscious of and working on ways to best monetize those channels.
Operator
We’ll go next to Ross Sandler of Deutsche Bank.
Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank
Hi. Great, guys. Just two quick questions. First is on Brazil, second on fulfillment. So you guys are hiring in Brazil for local content relationships for Kindle and some warehouse personnel. So how important do you view that market in terms of the retail business. When do you think you could be in Brazil with the retail presence?
And then the second question is fulfillment, as a growth -- as a percent of gross profit showed year-on-year leverage for the first time in like three years, so do you feel like you’ve turned the corner on some of the capacity improvements or given the pace of new facility that you’re putting in. Is there any reason why that would reverse back down again from here?
Tom Szkutak
In terms of the first question, we have a longstanding practice of not talking about what we might or might not do. Certainly, Brazil is an interesting geography as well as there are others. And we certainly export to Brazil today, but beyond that there’s not a lot to talk to.
In terms of fulfillment, you are seeing a little bit of leverage in Q3 versus what we’ve seen in the past few years. Again, it’s one quarter, I wouldn’t read too much into that at this stage. But certainly, we feel good about the footprint that we have. We feel good about a lot of the capacity that we’ve added since 2010.
Some of that capacity going back is getting more productive than it had been. The challenging part is obviously we’re layering on a sizable number of [FC] this year on top of that, that you’re seeing the cost for. So, there is again the 19 that we’ve announced today.
Operator
And we’ll take our next question from Mark Miller of William Blair.
Mark Miller - William Blair
Hi, good afternoon. Could you share what you’ve learnt with the add-on program and the purchase rate you’re seeing? And do you think over time you can have a meaningful expansion of smaller ticket items and can that effect the percent of orders that have multiple items in the shipment?
Tom Szkutak
In terms of add-ons, we’re -- a goal is to try to make products available to customers that we aren’t able to make available to before. And so it’s very early, but that’s the -- it’s just one additional way that we can add selection for customers and be able to get it to customer profitably. So again, it’s not much more towards than that.
Operator
And we’ll go now to Herman Leung of Susquehanna.
Herman Leung - Susquehanna
Great. Thanks, guys. Two quick questions. I guess when you look into your holiday as you might go into the holiday season with your third-party inventory last year hitting sort of a bump with video games, as well as some of the Thailand floods. I was wondering what types of steps you guys are kind of doing to better prepare yourselves for holiday season that this upcoming holiday season?
And the second question is wondering, how we should think about the increasing cost -- shipping cost leverage as you go into 2013 with your distribution centers much closer and a higher percentage of FBA units? Thanks.
Tom Szkutak
In terms of holiday readiness, we feel very good. We’re -- as you can see from our inventory at the end of Q3 it started, we’re adding inventory getting ready for the holiday season that will happen throughout Q4. We’re continuing trying to increase our in stock levels. So, you’re certainly seeing some of that already in the numbers.
And we’re very excited about getting ready for a great holiday season. And that’s with our own retail inventory. Certainly, we haven’t sellers, we’re selling on a platform would be doing the same thing. And we’re getting forward to have a great experience for customers during Q4.
In terms of shipping cost leverage, I think there is a great opportunity over a longer period of time in terms of providing what there would happen from a short-term leverage standpoint to be premature to that at this stage. But we can checking in future periods and talk more about that.
Operator
And we’ll go now to Anthony DiClemente of Barclays.
Anthony DiClemente - Barclays
I have just one question. On the North America media segment just a modest deceleration. I would imagine that digital content sales and download to rent probably grew much faster than the growth rate of that segment. And so, I’m just wondering if there is anything specifically that you can call out that was weighing that growth down in that segment, whether it’s physical media or otherwise? Thanks.
Tom Szkutak
I think you’ve characterized it correctly. Digital content is growing very fast. And it’s reflected in the number that you see there, beyond that there is not a lot of call outs with the exception of. If you look back over the past five quarters, certainly the highest growth we’ve had will be Q3 of 2011, which we’re lapping.
So, that’s the other factor. But again, very good growth on the digital media also keep in mind, that the growth of digital will also trail our device sales and given the new launches that we’ve had recently that’s -- that will be good for our digital content to going forward.
Operator
Now, we’ll take a question from Michael Graham of Canaccord Adams.
Michael Graham - Canaccord Adams
Hi, good afternoon. Tom, last quarter you made a comment that same day delivery on a wide scale wasn’t a goal. And since then, I’ve got more anecdotal evidence of people getting a lot of same day delivery especially here in New York. There was some news from Wal-Mart that they were going to start shipping from their stores. So could you give us any updated thoughts or philosophy you might have around what’s an appropriate amount of time to strive for to deliver to people?
And then as a quick follow-up to that, it seems like every quarter you’re guiding to sort of 1% operating margins. And just wondering like is that a philosophical way that you’re managing the business. Is there sort of an infinite number of things that you guys could spend on if you wanted to. And we should expect this sort of level going forward?
Tom Szkutak
In terms of same day delivery or delivery speed, we have just a tremendous amount of selection and what I was referring to last time was, I said, I talked about with a large amount of selection broadly to that certainly challenging to do same day everywhere, it’s certainly a challenge from an economic standpoint.
That being said, we -- if you look back over the past several years, we have done -- added a lot of capacity. We’re getting -- we have large FCs that are closer and closer to customers that has helped improve our delivery speed to customers and programs like Prime specifically has helped us get closer and closer to customers from a delivery speed standpoint.
So, what I would expect moving forward would be more the same. We’re going to continue to improve the customer experience in every possible way we can, which includes getting closer to customers from a shipping standpoint. And we feel good about that and again, you’ve seen improvements some in the past year and in the past several years and New York is one of those examples, where you’re seeing certainly indoor shipments going in the same day in cases.
Operator
And our final question will come from Justin Post of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch
Thank you. Just thinking about this investment cycle, it’s been like two years and a quarter and yet our revenues decelerating a little bit and free cash flow and margin trends are continuing to be down kind of down year-over-year. Can you just talk about, what you’re seeing on the returns on the investments you’ve been making over the last two years? And as far as like return on investment capital, is the profile of your returns changing over time as you think about history?
And then when can we start seeing kind of returns on this as far as revenues improving or kind of some of the financial ratios starting to turn. Can give us any thoughts on how you’re thinking about that?
And then, just have a financial question. U.S. revenues for other were up 63% and then international was plus 15 for other and I think the difference is AWS. Is there any other big differences between the two geographies that we should think about? Thank you.
Tom Szkutak
In terms of return on invested capital beyond the total numbers, there is not any specifics that I can point to right now. But what I can tell you is, in terms of your profile if you think about the parts of our business. The retail business, I feel very good. We have a lot of experience in terms of getting greats returns for our shareowners.
We feel something that we have, again a lot of experience in. As we’ve added new categories in particular geographies. Oftentimes, we’ve already launched those in other geographies. So we’re able to learn from the experiences we’ve had to-date. So, we feel good about those. We have a great portion of our businesses. And our media business is converting to digital. So, we’ve talked a lot about that. And feel very good about the opportunity that we have there, both in terms of making great devices as well as integrating content into those devices.
So, we feel good about that business and its growing very fast. In terms of our Web Services business that’s a -- if you start with the core operation of that business. We’ve been in that part of the business serving Amazon, the customer since inception. We’ve added a lot of new services that have helped both Amazon internally, as well as external customers.
We like the characteristics of the potential ROIC potential of those of that business as well. Our third-party business continues to grow on our consumer business dramatically. And we like the ROIC potential of those. We’re investing in a lot of new geographies, a few in the last couple of years, on top that China. China’s you should think about that one has more of the long-term opportunity, something that we’ve been investing in for several years, you shouldn’t be expecting high returns on invested capital in the short run in that geography, but very exciting from a long-term perspective.
Italy and Spain, we’re in an investment mode in those geographies. But again, those are more in line with some of the other geographies we’re in, in terms of timeline for returns and feel very good about those. So, hopefully that gives you some picture of a little bit of the landscape and how we’re thinking about ROICs.

OperatorGood day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Second Quarter 2012 Financial Results Teleconference. (Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Sean Boyle. Please go ahead.Sean BoyleHello, and welcome to our Q2 2012 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 26, 2012, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you'll find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2011. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom.Tom SzkutakThanks, Sean. I will begin with comments on our second quarter financial results. Trailing 12 months operating cash flow was $3.22 billion compared with $3.2 billion. Trailing 12-months free cash flow decreased 40% to $1.1 billion. Return on invested capital was 11%, down from 21%. ROIC is trailing 12-months free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long term debt over five quarter ends.The combination of common stock, stock-based awards outstanding, was 468 million share compared with 468 million shares. Worldwide revenue grew 29% to $12.83 billion or 32% excluding the $272 million, unfavorable impact from the year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We are grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers.Media revenue increased to $4.12 billion, up 13% or 15% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $8.16 billion, up 38% or 42% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 64% of worldwide sales, up from 59%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 43%. Active customer counts exceeded to 180 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units were 40% of paid units compared to 36% of paid units in Q2 of 2011.Now I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $9.49 billion, or 73.9% of revenue compared with 75.9%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined, was $2.99 billion or 23.3% of sales up approximately 307 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $1.3 billion or 10.1% of revenue compared with 9.2%. Tech and content was $970 million or 7.6% of revenue compared with 6.3%. Marketing was $521 million or 4.1% of revenue compared with 3.3%.Now I will talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America’s segment, revenue grew 36% to $7.33 billion. Media revenue grew 18% to $1.87 billion, EGM revenue grew 41% to 4.94 billion representing 67% of North America revenues up from 65%. North America segment operating income increased 61% to $344 million a 4.7% operating margin.In the international segment, revenue grew 22% to 5.51 billion adjusting for the $269 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 28%. Media revenue grew 8% to 2.25 billion or 12% excluding foreign exchange. And EGM revenue grew 34% to 3.22 billion or 42% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 59% of international revenues up from 53%.International segment operating income decreased 91% to 16 million or 0.3% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, international segment operating income decreased 74%.Consolidated segment operating income decreased 7% to 360 million or 2.8% of revenue down approximately 109 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange CSOI decreased 4%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 47% to $107 million or 0.8% of net sales.Our income tax expense was $109 million a 75% effective tax rate for the quarter and includes a one-time expense of $51 million related to the integration of Kiva Systems acquisition. Accordingly, our Q2 2012 effective tax rate is higher than both our current estimated 2012 annual effective rate and our 2011 effective tax rate.GAAP net income was $7 million or $0.01 per diluted share compared with $191 million and $0.41 per diluted share. Q2 2012 net income includes $65 million of estimated loss related to the acquisition and integration of Kiva Systems.Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities decreased 1.39 billion year-over-year to 4.97 billion. Inventory increased 36% to 4.3 billion and inventory turns were 10.1 down from 11.3 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in stock levels and introduced new product categories.Accounts payable increased 24% to 7.07 billion and accounts payable days decreased to 68 from 69 in the prior year. Our Q2 2012 capital expenditures were $657 million, the increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth consisting of investments in technology infrastructure including Amazon web services and additional capacity to support our funding operations.I’ll conclude my portion of today’s call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to-date and what we believe today to be properly conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors including a high level of uncertainties surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies among such subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on guidance.Our guidance further assumes that we don’t conclude any additional business acquisition, investments or settlement, record any further revision for stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.For the Q3 2012 we expect net sales of between 12.9 and 14.3 billion or growth between 19 and 31%. This guidance anticipates approximately 425 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates.GAAP operating income or loss to be between 350 million loss and 50 million loss down from 79 million income in the comparable prior year period. This includes approximately $275 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expenses to be between $75 million loss and $225 million in income, or between a 129% decline and 14% decline. We expect capital expenditures including capitalized software development to be approximately $0.8 billion to $0.9 billion. These anticipated investments are driven primarily by our expectations of a continued business growth consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon web service and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.We remain heads on focused on driving better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholder. Thanks. With that, Sean, we will move to questions.Sean BoyleGreat. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.Question-and-Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Spencer Wang with Crédit Suisse.Spencer Wang - Crédit SuisseThanks, good afternoon. Just one question on Kiva and a couple of parts, Tom. Now that you have closed the acquisition, can you talk about how you will deploy the Kiva technology? Is that for new fulfillment centers only or can you use that in your legacy fulfillment centers and perhaps what type efficiencies that could gain. And then last part would be, is there any impact on your 3Q guidance from the Kiva acquisition specifically? Thanks.Tom SzkutakSure. In terms of Kiva itself, we are very very excited to have Kiva as part of the Amazon team. You know we are looking forward to getting great productivity over time through the use. But again it’s very early and you’ll just have to stay tuned in terms of the plan. In terms of the impact, you mentioned Q3. Let me just provide a little bit of data on both Q2 actuals and Q3. In terms GAAP operating income in Q2, it was negative $25 million. For Q3 it’s approximately negative $35 million. And then on the net income for Q2, it was a loss of approximately $65 million. And so those are the numbers for Q2 and Q3. But again we are very very happy to have them part of them and that we look forward to working with them going forward.OperatorWe will go next to Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.Heather Bellini - Goldman SachsQuestion on the gross margin, continues to climb up, and I was wondering if you could give any commentary there around how agency versus wholesale and eBooks is contributing to that?Tom SzkutakYeah, the bigger issue is not that, it’s related to overall 3P, a number of factors of different factors certainly driving the improvement in product gross margins that you are referring to. But as it relates to 3P, it’s on the broader 3P. So if you take a look at from a units perspective, third party was 40% of our total units in Q2. That’s up from 36%. So it’s approximately 400 basis points increase as a percentage of total units which is certainly one of the factors that you are seeing there.OperatorWe will go next to Herman Leung with Susquehanna.Unidentified AnalystThis is [Deepak] sitting in for Herman. So the question I had was on the hardware business. So how important do you think is the hardware strategy to you for the digital content? Now given that Kindle Fire has been out there for a while, so could you discuss about the strategy on the business and how it’s driving the digital content?Tom SzkutakSure. You know we are very excited about both the hardware and the content of the business. We think if you take a look at our devices, certainly it’s very integrated, which is great for customers. So we think it’s incredible experience. And so we have been very excited about the progress we have made so far from both a device and content standpoint. And we are super excited about the road map that we have. So again, that’s again, very, very happy with what the team is doing there.OperatorAnd we will go next to Brian Nowak with Nomura Equity Research.Aram Rubinson - Nomura Equity ResearchThis is Aram Rubinson sitting in for Brian Nowak. I notice your shipping cost was lower as a percent of sales for the first time in nearly three years. The driver it looks like it's shipping cost per unit which fell about 10%. Can you talk about how much of that might be attributable to proximity of distribution centers to metro areas, lower fuel, more favorable carrier pricing etcetera, and whether or not you see anything on the horizon that would change that course.Tom SzkutakYes, we are seeing, there is a number of different factors, but certainly one of them is we are getting closer to customers and that’s just with our wide [multitude of film] networks, so that’s really having an impact on that. And again we have a lot of opportunities to improve that overtime, but again the team is making good progress and you are seeing that reflected in the results so far.OperatorWe will go next to Justin Post with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Paul Bieber - Bank of America/Merrill LynchThis is Paul Bieber for Justin. Just going back for the gross margin question, I was wondering if you could give us some color on the relative impact of few different things; category, maturity, advertising, 3P, and maybe digital content on gross margins, which ones are impacting gross margins more than others. And then just quick question on the taxes. What were the impact of sales tax in Texas and California beyond gross margins?Tom SzkutakIn terms of your question on gross margins, we are not breaking that up but certainly 3P is having the impact, mix of businesses having an impact. We continue to try to work with our partners to get even better prices on the goods that we provide for customers which is certainly impacting it. Mix of business things like [AWS] is certainly impacting that as well, given the growth rate there. So, again those are things that are impacting. In terms of sales taxes, any impact that we certainly would expect to see would be included in guidance that we are giving for Q3, but one thing to keep in mind as it relates to that is we right now approximately 50% of our business around the world, we either collect sales tax or value added tax. We have very good businesses in those jurisdictions and so [keep that in mind] you should think about any upcoming changes.OperatorWe will go next to Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.Kaizad Gotla - JPMorganThis is Kaizad Gotla in for Doug. Just a couple of questions, can you discuss the international media deceleration, it looks like it decelerated from 22 to 12% on an ex-FX basis. And then can you maybe just give us an update on the fulfillment center plans for the rest of the year. Thanks.Tom SzkutakI’ll take international in total first and then, you know that the same is true for media, and really I’ll even start with the total business. Total business grew 32%. One thing to keep this on currency basis, one thing to keep in mind is for both the total business international growth and international media, we had a very, very strong growth last year Q2. In fact our total growth rate last year was 51% for the total business and on a local currency basis that was 44% growth, that’s the highest growth quarter we’ve had in over 10 years. And so when you look at that, when you are comparing ourselves in Q2 this year, we had very good growth given that compare to last year, and that some of which we are seeing also in international media as you mentioned. So, international media was up 8%, on a local currency basis so it was up 12 and certainly it's a challenging compare.Also there were some things just with, as we some timely things as we launched with the unfortunate events in Japan last year, we certainly did have some releases that with scope of relating the quarter obviously didn’t happened, they moved into Q2 just from a supply standpoint those are certainly impacting that region and some other things. So it’s, again, think of it in terms of the comparison point for last year is probably the best thing to do.OperatorWe will go next to Mark Mahaney with Citi.Rohit Kulkarni - CitigroupThis is Rohit Kulkarni filling in for Mark. Couple of questions. Can you talk about, or disclose anything about mobile, how that’s affecting your business. eBay talked about mobile affecting their growth rates quite materially, perhaps even by a few percentage points and accounting for almost 10% of their revenues maybe.And second is, can you talk about the broad philosophy of management about short-term profitability versus long-term growth. Probably this is the first time in a while that you have bracketed negative pro forma operating income in your guidance. How should we view your short-term investment or the short-term profitability outlook.Tom SzkutakSure. First in terms on mobile. Clearly, smartphones and tablets are a significant tailwind for our business. While we are not breaking out the numbers, it’s a big tailwind on our business and it’s going great. So we are seeing a very nice impact from that and again it’s a tailwind that we expect that will continue. In terms of short term versus long-term, you know we are all about trying to make sure we do the right long-term things for both customers and shareowners. But more specifically around Q3, you know Q3 is similar to Q2 and other previous quarters and that we are investing certainly for the long term.Yet, on the flip side, keep in mind, as you look at Q3 specifically, we are getting ready for a most seasonal quarter and we expect, given the growth that we have had, we are seeing very strong growth so we are investing heavily to get ready for that. In terms of capacity for example, we have announced 18 new fulfillment centers so far this year. We have actually opened eight of those already this year, out of the 18. And we are looking at potentially opening even more than that. I am sorry, six opened so far this year, out of 18. So those are certainly something are impacting the cost so far and you will be seeing that heavier in Q3 as we get ready for the most seasonal quarter.OperatorWe will go next to Mark Miller with William Blair.Mark Miller - William BlairHi, I was hoping, you could share some perspective on your URL expansion strategy. I’d like to know, I guess some sense for the growth you are seeing there and how material it is in your overall numbers. And should we expect to see further expansion in those sites.Tom SzkutakYeah. There’s not a lot I can you know help you with there. We are certainly looking as you would expect us to do, ways to continue to grow and certainly that will be part of our strategy.OperatorWe will go next to Scott Tillman with Caris & Company.Scott Tillman - Caris & CompanyTom, I was just curious, we have had a few quarters where operating income has far surpassed the upper end of your guidance range and we had a quarter here you definitely seemed to weaken as the months went by. Just wondering what you think is causing that divergence between sort of expectation at the beginning of the quarter and how things are playing out. Then just as a quick follow up to one of the other questions. You are looking at the fulfillment center network, just wondering if you are satisfied with the fee increases that were put in place in February that that business is now matching the margin for the rest of the business.Tom SzkutakI am sorry, could you elaborate on the months going by, I wasn’t following your question.Scott Tillman - Caris & CompanyOn operating income, we have had a couple of -- a few quarters here where the numbers have come in far better than guidance. And we actually had a situation where Europe actually got worst as the quarter went on. So wondering what is driving that out performance.Tom SzkutakGot it. You know we, certainly as you look at, I will talk to Q2 since it’s the most recent quarter, but we had a lot of strength across many different areas. One of the ones I mentioned that certainly helped our operating profit as well as our gross margin with the third party business continued to be very very strong. And certainly that was a factor. Again, there was a number of factors. One thing too, you do see some timing differences to some extent between Q2 and Q3 in terms of our prep for Q4, you see that knowing our operating results, but you see that in our CapEx. In the last 90 days ago we said that we would spend approximately 800 to $900 million of CapEx for Q2, we spent little less than 700. You see that number for Q3 being 8 to 900 as well. It's 900 million. So, again those are things that you are seeing just a little bit of a shift between Q2 and Q3 there.OperatorWe will go next to Ron Josey with ThinkEquity.Ron Josey - ThinkEquityI wanted to ask you a quick on 3P and given it's around 40% of sale this year, item sold. What point you believe the customer experience on Amazon is at risk given the rise of third-party sales. And any insight in terms of adoption on FBA by third parties would be very helpful. And then one quick follow-up just on your comments on CapEx, I think you said, it came in lower in 2Q, guidance is for another 8 to 900 million, is that guidance sort of consistent maybe going out, going forward or is this sort of one-time build around technology. Thank you.Tom SzkutakIn terms of the third party units, certainly FBA is having an impact on that, that’s one of the drivers, certainly that’s helping us have that percentage of total units go up. And we have looked at and we have been working very hard over a number of years on improving the experience for both customers and for sellers and FBA is an example of that. And what ends up happening is FBA sellers wants their part of the program, those units that FBA and our fulfillment network are eligible for all of our programs including free super saver shipping, prime. So, again those are great, certainly that’s a great program for our customers, it's great program for seller and it's great program for investors.And I don’t of it as a bad thing at all, I think of it as a good thing. We have a lot of retail units that we send directly to customers, we are offering a great experience on third party units which includes FBA and a number of other programs that we have. So, again we will continue to try to make that even better for customers overtime, but it's working very well, and again those are the benefit of having third parties on a platform is we get to [equate] some new selection. We also have competing offers directly on our detail pages, so when customers come they get to choose in terms of who they want to purchase from. So, it's a competitive environment on our platform. So, we think that’s great for customers and for us.OperatorWe will go next to So Young Lee with SunTrust.So Young Lee - SunTrust Robinson HumphreyI was just curious about LivingSocial, it seem to be a bigger loss unusual, can you give us some color on what happened perhaps. And secondly, can you talk about the kind of traction you are getting with LOVEFiLM given all of the exclusive content you are getting there.Tom SzkutakLOVEFiLM business is doing very well. It's growing nicely as you mentioned we continue to add content there, and we plan on having more content there overtime. I’m very excited to have that business at part of Amazon and the team is doing great. In terms of LivingSocial there is a not a lot, I can add to it other than what we have disclosed.OperatorWe will go next to Ken Sena with Evercore Partners.Andrew McNellis - Evercore PartnersThis is Andrew McNellis in for Ken. Somewhat related to other questions that have been asked, could you provide any update to your same day shipping efforts and how that relates to sales tax and performance in your investment?Tom SzkutakIn terms of delivery speed to customers, we are certainly trying to get geographically, always trying to get closer to customers, that’s something that’s not new, it's something we have been doing for some time. But in terms of same day, we don’t really see a way to do same day delivery on a broad scale economically. But again we will continue to work on behalf of customers to try to figure out a way to serve them even better by getting product faster but in terms of same day, we don’t see a way to do that on a broad scale economically.OperatorWe will go next to Anthony Diclemente with Barclays.Perry Gold - Barclays CapitalThis is Perry Gold on for Anthony. Can you please touch on the online sales tax issue and how it could affect your build out strategy for fulfillment centers?Tom SzkutakYou know as I mentioned earlier, we have -- we do collect in several states within the U.S. We do collect in a number of geographies that have an equivalent value added tax, approximately half for our business. We actually sales tax, the value added tax. We do very good business in those geographies. Those geographies reflected, for the most part, if you go back on the last several years, most of them have been included. We have also certainly added some new geographies or new jurisdictions that we clocked during that time period. But you see that we have seen very very strong growth even while collecting. So we are very supportive of collecting. We think the best way to do that is through a federal solution and we keep working with Congress and others to try to get that passed.OperatorWe will go next to Kerry Rice with Needham & Company.Kerry Rice - Needham & CompanyKind of sales tax issue again. Amazon signed a lot of bilateral agreements with several states on the collection of sales tax. And I know there is a federal effort also going on. Can you talk about if a federal sales tax is passed, how does that impact your bilateral agreements with the states. Does that supersede it or does that kind of have to continue to go on with those particular states and build those fulfillment centers and things in those states that you have agreed to.Tom SzkutakThere is not a lot I can add to that. So I can't be that helpful with your question, I apologize. But again, you are right, we do support federal legislation, we are working very hard at that. One thing to keep In mind to, we price our products irrespective of what sales tax is, that’s a customer obligation and so we are pricing products very well. And so that’s not something that we just started doing, that’s something that we have been doing for a long time. And that’s why we have a good business in those geographies and jurisdictions where we do collect. And because customers are coming to us because they want to have value which we offer irrespective of tax, there has been a number of different third parties that have certainly reported on that. They come because they want great convenience, they want obviously great service, and those are things we are focused and those are the things that we believe customers will still want over the long-term and that’s why are focused on those areas.OperatorWe will go next to Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities.Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo SecuritiesThe international segment operating income has been under a lot of pressure. Is that primarily related to existing markets, growth in new markets? And would that be on the merchandize margin side of the P&L or is it more of an operating cost issue.Tom SzkutakKeep in mind with international, it’s a mix of geographies and we are -- certainly there are some that we are investing in. We mentioned certainly in other calls, China is an area that is growing very fast but we are certainly in investment mode there. In recent years, we have launched Italy and Spain. We are certainly investing in those geographies and like what we see there. Those are certainly impacting. We are also adding a lot of fulfillment capacity. And so those are the things that are certainly impacting those numbers.OperatorWe will take our last question from Atul Bagga with Lazard Capital.Atul Bagga - Lazard CapitalI have two questions. One on guidance and the other one prime members. Can you give us some color on guidance, what you are baking for growth in international versus domestic? And guidance implies there is some compression in margin. Is it again mostly the function of the sales mix or is something else going on there. And then a second on prime members. Can you remind us the profitability of prime members versus non-prime member and in the longer-term where do you think the penetration of prime members within your overall base?Tom SzkutakIn terms of revenue, we don’t break out the segments in terms of the split. But if you take a look at our guidance, it’s to grow between 19% and 31%. And if you look at the impact of exchange, it’s a little over 400 basis points and so rounded it's just under 36% on the high end and 23% on the low end. And so that’s the range of guidance and so we are certainly pleased with what we saw in Q2 and certainly giving as we have in past quarters a wide range for Q3. In terms of the bottom line, in terms of operating income and CSOI guidance that we have given, as I mentioned earlier, certainly a number of different factors like the last several quarters, as we have been talking about we are certainly investing a lot in the business, but one thing to keep in mind is for the guidance in upcoming quarter to Q3. And we are certainly getting ready given the growth rates we had for our most seasonal quarter, that’s certainly impacting the bottom line in terms of our guidance and as I mentioned earlier we opened a lot of performance centers, adding a lot of capacity for both our web service businesses as well as infrastructure support. Our retail business, so again we are investing across the business which is like all the periods, but again we are getting ready for Q4.OperatorThat will conclude our question-and-answer session. I’ll turn it back over to our speaker’s for any additional or closing remarks.Tom SzkutakThank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions.

Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com First Quarter 2012 Financial Results Teleconference. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Sean Boyle. Please go ahead, sir.
Sean Boyle
Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2012 Financial Results Conference Call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 26, 2012, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.
During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you'll find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with our comparable GAAP measures.
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2011. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas J. Szkutak
Thanks, Sean. I'll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 1% to $3.05 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 39% to $1.15 billion. Return on invested capital was 12%, down from 24%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 464 million shares compared with 466 million shares. During the quarter, we repurchased 5.3 million shares of our common stock for $960 million. 
Worldwide revenue grew 34% to $13.18 billion or 34% excluding the $56 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers. 
Media revenue increased to $4.71 billion, up 19% or 19% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $7.97 billion, up 43% or 43% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 60% of worldwide sales, up from 57%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 49%. Active customer accounts exceeded 173 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units were 39% of paid units compared to 36% of paid units in the Q1 2011.
Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $10.03 billion or 76.1% of revenue compared with 77.2%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $2.76 billion or 20.9% of sales, up approximately 283 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $1.26 billion or 9.5% of revenue compared with 8.4%. Tech and content was $816 million or 6.5% of revenue compared with 5.3%. Marketing was $468 million or 3.6% of revenue compared with 3.2%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results. And consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation expense or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 36% to $7.43 billion. Media revenue grew 17% to $2.2 billion. EGM revenue grew 44% to $4.77 billion, representing 64% of North America revenues, up from 60%. North America segment operating income increased 20% to $349 million, a 4.7% operating margin. 
In the International segment, revenue grew 31% to $5.76 billion. Adjusted for the $55 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 32%. Media revenue grew 21% to $2.51 billion or 22%, excluding foreign exchange. And EGM revenue grew 40% to $3.2 billion or 42%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 56% of International revenues, up from 52%. International segment operating income decreased 72% to $49 million, a 0.9% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, International segment operating income decreased 65%.
CSOI decreased 15% to $398 million or 3% of revenue, down approximately 170 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased 14%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 40% to $192 million or 1.5% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $43 million in Q1, resulting in a 51% rate for the quarter. GAAP net income was $130 million or $0.28 per diluted share compared with $201 million or $0.44 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities decreased $1.17 billion year-over-year to $5.71 billion. Inventory increased 47% to $4.25 billion and inventory turns were 10.4, down from 11.6 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 24% to $6.89 billion and accounts payable days decreased to 62 from 66 in the prior year. 
Our Q1 2012 capital expenditures were $386 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including the Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance excludes the financial results on the Kiva Systems acquisition, which we expect to close in the second quarter of 2012, and assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q2 2012, we expect net sales of between $11.9 billion and $13.3 billion or growth of between 20% and 34%. This guidance anticipates approximately 240 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income or loss to be between $260 million loss and $40 million of income or between 229% decline and 80% decline. This includes approximately $260 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate Consolidated Segment Operating Income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between 0 and $300 million or between 100% decline and 22% decline. 
We expect capital expenditures including capitalized software development to be approximately $0.8 billion to $0.9 billion. These anticipated investments are driven primarily by our expectations of continued business growth, consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. 
We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, Sean, let's move to questions.
Sean Boyle
Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse.
Spencer Wang - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Tom, just a couple quick questions. One, I was wondering if you could update us on your plans for fulfillment center increases in 2012. And then also on Prime Instant Video, you guys are over 17,000 movies and TV episodes now. Are you guys at a critical mass? Or do you guys expect to continue to invest aggressively there? And one last quick clarification question, the CapEx guidance, was that for the second quarter or the full year?
Thomas J. Szkutak
Sure. I'll take the last one first. The CapEx was for the second quarter. And the first question on fulfillment centers, in terms of announcements so far that are out there, we've announced 13 for 2012. And so certainly, any changes to that, we'd be back to you. But again, we're experiencing very, very strong growth both in terms of retail but also our FBA. We're seeing that in our third-party growth. Our third-party growth increased in Q1 over 60% again this quarter. Again, a big piece of that was certainly FBA is doing very well. So again, we're continuing to invest, and the number is 13.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.
Scott W. Devitt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Tom, I just had a question around the operating margin dynamics in the North American market versus International. If you look at it year-over-year, I guess, or even sequentially, the International margin is down pretty materially, but you had a significant uptick in the North American margins, so sequentially and just a moderate decline year-over-year. So wondering if you can just clarify what's happening in North America versus the International markets. Is it 3P FBA having a more significant effect in the U.S. versus other markets? And then I had one follow-up question.
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of the -- we're investing heavily in both segments. But what you're seeing is, clearly, if you look at over the past couple years, we've launched a few new geographies, Italy and Spain. We're investing in those geographies. As we've talked about in the past, China, we continue to invest there. We think it's growing very fast. We like what we see. We think it's a great long-term opportunity for investing there. So those are some of the dynamics that are impacting International. And so we continue to invest again across both geographies. But those are things that are a little bit different. In terms of third-party growth, we're seeing very strong third-party growth across International, as well as North America, so we're pleased to do that. And we're investing again on behalf of customers and sellers, as well as retail for the capacity that we need to do that.
Scott W. Devitt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
And then secondly, on the employee base growth, I don't know if thinking about unit growth is the right way to think about it. But is there a point in time where you think the employee base starts to grow more in line possibly with unit growth? And can you maybe walk through where you're adding most significantly that's driving the headcount growth?
Thomas J. Szkutak
Sure. We are adding a lot of resources across a number of different areas. But certainly if you look at both year-over-year and sequentially, the Q1 numbers that you're looking at, the vast majority of that is in operations and customer service. Again, and those are based on the hirings that we did coming out of Q4. We have a lot of -- we do supplement our workforce with temporaries in Q4. We did hire a number of those coming out of Q4. And those are reflected in the numbers. And to answer your other question, yes, we'll moderate it at some point certainly. But again, we're -- given the growth that we're experiencing right now, we are investing and we're making sure that we have the right resources to do that.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Mark Mahaney with Citi.
Mark S. Mahaney - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
Tom, could you just provide a little more color on the gross margin trends? And it also looks within that like shipping for the first time in a while shows a little bit less deleverage than it has in the past. Is there some sort of tipping point you've reached there? And just broadly on gross margins, that real drive-up that you've seen over the last couple of quarters, is that primarily just due to product mix shifts or revenue mix shifts? Is there anything else in there? And then could you also just briefly comment on AmazonSupply.com? Would some of that -- all of the inventory that you've built up for that launch, would was that -- have we seen that in the buildup in inventory and the reduction in turns? Or are we going to see that going forward?
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of the -- we're not reporting gross margin specifically. But in terms of -- if you take a look at the relationship between COGS and revenue, certainly, one of the things we're seeing, a number of different factors there, certainly mix of business is one. But another factor is certainly the one I mentioned earlier, which is around third-party growth. We saw very strong unit growth overall this quarter, up from last quarter, so we had sequential growth. Third-party units as a percentage of total units were up approximately 300 basis points over last year. And we saw just great third-party unit growth, so it was up over 60% again in Q1. And so those are factors that are certainly impacting our operating margins, if you will. In terms of supply -- AmazonSupply.com, certainly, we have inventory on hand to support that business. It's certainly something that we're optimistic over the long-term. But in terms of the inventory increase that you've seen, it's very broad over a number of different businesses and categories and geographies. So that's really what's driving it.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
I had 2 for you. First, I was wondering if you could talk about just over the last few years if you could give us a sense how much of the third-party increase has been related to agency e-books. And then the second question is in light of the DOJ case, I was wondering if you could walk us through your thoughts about the agency e-book model, as well as whether or not this will mean we should see things move back to wholesale.
Thomas J. Szkutak
Yes. There's not a lot I can help you with there in terms of the questions. We do think that the suit is a big win for Kindle owners. And we look forward to being allowed to lower prices on more Kindle books. It's certainly our unit growth, if you will, in total -- I'm not talking 3P, just in total. Certainly, the paid unit growth has been certainly helped a lot by e-books. It's growing, as you can imagine very, very fast, so it's certainly impacting that growth rate that you've seen over the past few years, which has been great for us and great for customers. So beyond that, there's not a lot I can add to your questions.
Operator
And we'll go next to Ken Sena with Evercore Partners.
Kenneth Sena - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division
In your press release, you mentioned the launch of your Amazon Appstore. And can you just share any thoughts on current traction on Android or specifically off Kindle Fire? And what are some of the advantages and disadvantages that you see for Amazon in that area?
Thomas J. Szkutak
It's early, so there's not a lot I can do. We're excited about it. We think it's a very interesting opportunity and happy to do that on behalf of our customers. But stay tuned, and it's early.
Kenneth Sena - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division
And maybe one more follow-up. If you can just maybe talk about any of the traction you're seeing within Kindle Fire more broadly or any thoughts you have maybe around Kindle smartphone, that'd be great, too.
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of the Kindle Fire, we are pleased with the growth that we're seeing and customers are buying a lot of content. And you're seeing that when you look at particularly in North America. When you look at our North American media growth from Q4 to Q1, you're seeing that accelerate. And that's certainly a big part of it. And so we're very pleased with what's happening, and we're going to continue to add more and more content for customers and across all of our digital categories. And we think we have a great value proposition for customers today, and we're going to continue to make that better over time.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Doug Anmuth with JP Morgan.
Douglas Anmuth - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
I want to ask 2 things, Tom. If you could first just give us some more color on the outlook around segment operating income in 2Q and just how we should be thinking about the drivers there in terms of the sequential decline. And then secondly, just the North American media business, you saw good reacceleration from 4Q to 1Q. Can you talk about the factors there leading to that acceleration?
Thomas J. Szkutak
Sure. I'll take the second one first on North American media. I just mentioned that a little bit in one of the previous questions. But certainly, our digital media growth has been great and certainly it's helping that. One other call-out, just to keep in mind, in Q4, I had mentioned that video games, including video game consoles, the consoles are part of North America media, that's a seasonal business that was bringing down growth in Q4. So it's also something to keep in mind. In terms of our guidance, we've given a pretty broad range on both the top and the bottom as we have previously. We think the segment operating income on the bottom end of the range is certainly appropriately conservative. But again, things that you should think about, we'll continue to add capacity as we've talked about in the past. With the growth that we're experiencing, we are adding more. And as I mentioned on one of the earlier questions, we've announced approximately 13 new fulfillment centers. So those are as a result of the growth that we're experiencing. We're also adding capacity to support AWS in our retail business on the infrastructure side as well. So those are things to think about as you think about Q2 from a segment operating income, as well as the CapEx that I mentioned in the opening. Another area is certainly our digital offerings. We are certainly adding more content, and specifically, more video content, which will be as reflected in our guidance. And so those are factors, among others, that you should think about.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.
Charles Eugene Munster - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division
Another question on gross margin. It was obviously impressive results, the best in 3 years almost. And it's been a little bit of a roller coaster in terms of the profitability quarter-to-quarter. And we understand that you're in an investment phase and there's a massive opportunity ahead of you. Is there anything that you can tell us as we think going forward over the next few quarters? Just is the investment philosophy that played through this quarter going to play on in other quarters? Or is each quarter kind of its own 3 months and it could go either way?
Thomas J. Szkutak
Yes. Gene, in terms of guidance, we're just giving guidance on Q2 today. But the one thing I would say is again we're seeing very good growth, as you see in Q1 and reflected in the guidance for Q2. And we'll have to stay tuned to see what it looks like for the remainder of the year as we progress. But we're extremely happy with the opportunities that we have. We think it's -- we're in a great position with the opportunities that we have. Even though we've reached some scale, we just have tremendous opportunities in front of us. And that's why we're investing in those.
Operator
And we'll go next to Brian Nowak with Nomura.
Brian Nowak - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
I have a couple of questions. The first one is I know there's a lot of focus on kind of CSOI margins and margin pressure from the build. But I was just curious if you still see areas of your business in the oldest part of your business, where you think you have inefficiencies you can still work to improve execution and kind of get some margin lift out of those in the oldest part of the business just to improve execution. And the second one is any more clarity on how much roughly Quidsi and Lovefilm added to revenue growth this quarter?
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of opportunities for improvement, even though we've made a lot of progress, we still feel we have a lot of room for improvement in all parts of our business. Certainly, the most opportunity is the newer parts. But certainly if you go back and look at -- we're still trying to get great productivity and putting together programs to get great productivity in each of our operations. And so there's really too many to list here on the call today. But we look at in all facets for our business in terms of productivity. We think there's opportunities to partner with vendors even more to get better savings and better prices for customers. So the list is long. But I think when you look at the opportunities in terms of the ranking, in terms of at least basis points improvement, start with the newer things that we've launched -- at least directionally, the newer things that we've launched, work your way backwards, and those were usually where the biggest opportunities are in terms of basis points.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities.
Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Just going back to the ""gross margin"", is it fair to say, given the change in that metric and the change in third-party units, that potentially the core margins in 1P really accelerated in the first quarter in addition to there being a continued mix shift to 3P? That's my first question. And then secondly, can you comment on any product categories in either media or EGM that either held you back in the quarter or were a tailwind? I think last quarter you mentioned video games and a few categories in terms of giving some color.
Thomas J. Szkutak
Yes. In terms of the second part of the question, I think the -- in terms of any headwinds, I would say there's a few areas, as we talked about last quarter with some of the supply issues that we had related to the Thailand floods that caused certainly issues, some issues for us specifically in the areas of some parts of cameras, audio, video, office equipment. And so you saw some of that impact in Q4, as well as Q1. The good news for us with our platform is we have many, many different sellers. So where we had supply, we continue to offer those for customers. And in cases where we didn't, oftentimes we had third parties that may have had -- still had inventory. So it certainly helped us very well to get through that situation. So those are some of the headwinds that were in Q1. And then we had very strong broad growth amongst many categories, certainly, in terms of the retail categories. And we also had very strong growth in Kindle. Globally, AWS is growing very, very fast. So we had some very, very positive, if you will, tailwinds from the strong growth.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Carlos Kirjner with Sanford Bernstein.
Carlos Kirjner - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
Two questions, if I may. First, on fulfillment. If you think of the expected authorization of your fulfillment network in the fourth quarter of this year versus what you had in the fourth quarter of '11, do you expect it to be the same, higher or lower? And secondly, on Kindle, now that you are a manufacturer, a seller of Android-based devices, can you comment on your intellectual property position and the strategic and financial risks associated with potential lawsuits from competitors? For example, do you intend to go buy patents in the market?
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of the first question, in terms of fulfillment utilization, difficult to say at this point what our utilization will be. We have a very good team of people who work on this in each of our geographies, trying to make sure we have adequate capacity throughout the year, as well as for Q4. And it's always a tough balance. We want to make sure that we have enough because we want to make sure we satisfy customers. And so we'll have to see as we progress through the year what the growth looks like. And we certainly -- based on what we're experiencing so far, we expect it to be very good. And we'll have to see what happens in future months and quarters to see what that looks like. So it's a little bit early to say what we think that utilization will be. But we're trying to make sure in any time we do this is to have enough but not too much. And it's a delicate balance, so hard to predict what it will be. In terms of your second question, I don't think there's a lot I can help you with there. We have -- we certainly have a lot of technology that we develop ourselves. And we have a great technical team that's working a lot of different interesting areas on behalf of customers and will continue to do so. Beyond that, there's not a lot I can comment.
Operator
And we'll go next to Jordan Rohan with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Jordan Rohan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
A couple of point of clarification. I don't think I heard you blame macro weakness in Europe. Now clearly, you had stronger results across-the-board, so I don't see it evident in the results. Are you clear enough about the direction of the macro or its impact on your European operations that you can kind of say, at least from what you're seeing, it's not affecting you now? And the second question is on this percentage of third-party versus first-party sales. Last quarter, I believe you said that it got up to 36% in part because of stockouts due to the Thai flood and such. At some point, one would think that the supply chain for cameras and other equipment affected by the Thai flood would normalize. Would we expect that to therefore normalize back down from 39% level back down to the mid-30s? How can we think about that relationship?
Thomas J. Szkutak
Sure. In terms of the macro economics of Europe specifically, it's -- we're not exactly a bellwether for the economy, and so it's hard to  assess. It certainly is having some impact on us. And you're certainly reading the same press as we are in terms of what's going on, and it's very challenging. But it's hard to quantify what that impact is, so we're certainly having some impact but it's hard to quantify, is how I would explain it. And then in terms of 3P, we have -- we've seen the dynamic that you're talking about in terms of it has helped us with stockouts both in Q4 and Q1 for sure and has helped growth. Where does it moderate? Hard to say. But we have seen outside of these 2 quarters, very good third-party growth. And that's been accelerating over the past couple years in terms of third-party unit growth. There's a number of different factors in terms of making that experience better for sellers. The most notable one is Fulfilled by Amazon. And so that's certainly having an impact in all the geographies that we operate and have that in. And so it's great for sellers, it's great for customers and it's great for shareowners. So it's a nice intersection there. So we're very excited about it, and that's really what's driving it. The stockouts and things, those will happen from time to time in various categories. And I think that's certainly one of the benefits of our model of having both first-party and third-party offerings. But I wouldn't view that as the substantial driver of what's happened in third party over the last few years. It's other things that we've done to improve that experience for sellers.
Operator
And we'll go next to Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank.
Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Just had a couple questions around AmazonSupply. And I guess, first, wondering if this is the beginning of a bigger push into the B2B kind of industrial space. And then secondly, what do you all see as your strongest assets as you approach this space? Are you planning to rely a lot on third party for inventory? And then just finally, along those lines, the press release mentions the extension of corporate credit. Wondering how integral this might be to the strategy. And then just more broadly, how do you think about credit extension to customers?
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of the AmazonSupply, it's an interesting -- we've been serving businesses for some time. This is just again a separate URL to help us do that with some interesting selection, we think, on behalf of businesses. We work very closely with a lot of businesses today, both as a customer on our consumer side of our business. We also obviously have a lot of third-party sellers that we work with as part of our seller business. So we're very excited about that. In terms of any -- in terms of extension of credit and everything, those are things that we're working through. And we want to make the right decisions on behalf of those customers. And I can't add much to that today. But certainly we can talk more about that in the future as that evolves.
Operator
And we'll go next to Anthony DiClemente with Barclays.
Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division
On the Kiva acquisition, I was wondering if you could talk about how you're planning on implementing that at your fulfillment centers. And does it require much incremental investment? And then more broadly about mobile purchasing behavior, wondering if you could speak to just the purchasing behavior you're seeing from your consumers in terms of what's the order of magnitude and what type of mix shift in buying that you're seeing from PC and mobile? That would be great.
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of Kiva, it's early. We haven't closed it yet. And so we're very, very excited to be having Kiva and the team as part of the Amazon team. We're extremely excited to have that. And in terms of implementations within Amazon, we still have a lot of work to do to figure out how and when we'll do that. And so those are things that we'll be working on. But we're very, very excited about the opportunity to join with Kiva. So we're excited about it. In terms of mobile, not a lot I can help you with there. Certainly, the mobile part of our business is growing very, very fast. And it's a very exciting opportunity. And this is not something that's new; it's something that we've been working on for a number of years in a number of geographies. And we'll continue to work on that experience to make it even better for customers over time.
Operator
And we'll go next to Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
A. Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
First question is on taxes. Can you help us at all understand what percent of your marketplaces currently pay taxes similar to, say, offline retail? And maybe any help on what you saw on New York with the tax law changes there. Maybe start with that, and then one follow-up.
Thomas J. Szkutak
I'm sorry. Could you repeat the first part of the question?
A. Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Yes. What percent of your market, including International markets, are already on what we call level-tax basis, meaning the taxes are the same for buying on Amazon versus an offline retailer?
Thomas J. Szkutak
Yes. So you're saying sales tax.
A. Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Yes, sales tax, yes.
Thomas J. Szkutak
Assume that approximately 50% of our sales, we either collect a sales tax or a value-added tax. So we collect it in several states today in the U.S. and a large number of geographies outside of the U.S. And so it's approximately 50%. So this is not anything new. This is something that we've been doing for a long period of time. And we have very good businesses in those geographies and states that we collect.
A. Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
And did you see any slowdown in states where they've enacted sales taxes in your sales levels?
Thomas J. Szkutak
Yes. I can't comment on any specific geography or state. But again, you can see by the growth that we've experienced over the past few years, which includes during those past few years, certainly adding some geographies, if you will, to our collection efforts. And so those are all represented in the results that you've seen over the past few years and several years. So that's all I can add to that.
Operator
And we'll go next to Herman Leung with Susquehanna Financial Group.
Herman Leung - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division
Two quick questions. First, I know there's a lot of investment going on in the data center areas for your Web Services business. I was wondering at the current level, I mean, what -- how much capacity you're able to support, especially as you're signing on more of these larger type customers on the government side? And I have a quick follow-up.
Thomas J. Szkutak
Yes. No, we're ready for additional demand. The team has worked extremely hard to make sure that we keep up with demand. And so as you've seen over the past few years now, you're seeing our CapEx growing. As a result of it, you're seeing the operating expense as it relates to that in our technology and content. And so the team has done a very nice job in terms of adding capacity and is very excited to continue this fast growth that we're experiencing in AWS. So we're very happy to do that.
Herman Leung - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division
And just a very quick follow-up. I guess, on your -- the GMV that's flowing through your third-party business, is there an opportunity over time to kind of share with us the real power of the third -- just the third-party volume that's actually flowing through the top line?
Thomas J. Szkutak
We have -- the best way to think about it, at least from our -- as it relates to our retail and third-party business, they're not -- it's certainly not a 1-for-1 because you have new and used products. You have different category mix. But in terms of an overall volume perspective, as I mentioned in some of the earlier comments, that it was about 30 -- approximately 39% of our total units, so it's very meaningful. And that's growing -- grew over 60% this quarter, again, up from 36% of our total units. So again, it's -- I can't give you the GMV. But in terms of units as it relates to our retail units, it's 39% of total units, so it's meaningful.
Operator
And we'll go next to Ben Schachter with Macquarie.
Benjamin A. Schachter - Macquarie Research
Given the success of the ad-supported Kindle, should we expect more devices to be offered with an ad-supported option? And then also if any comments on the dynamics driving the increase in the shipping revenue. And finally, any update on the share buyback?
Thomas J. Szkutak
Yes. In terms of what we do going forward, we certainly have a long-standing practice of not talking about what we would do going forward, so you have to stay tuned on that. In terms of the share repurchase, as I mentioned in the opening comments, we purchased 5.3 million shares, just under $1 billion, $960 million during the quarter. We have a little over $700 million or just under $800 million left on our authorization that we have from the board, which was $2 billion, that we got some ago. So that's left on the authorization.
Operator
And we'll take our last question from Colin Sebastian with R.W. Baird.
Gregor Schauer - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
This is Gregor Schauer in for Colin. I have a question regarding the Kindle Fire, which you guys have noted for the quarter is still the #1 bestselling and most gifted product on Amazon.com. But it's still only selling in the U.S. Can you help us think through or understand sort of what are the other considerations in terms of the timing of an international rollout of the Kindle Fire?
Thomas J. Szkutak
I really can't. I think you'd have to stay tuned. It's certainly a very interesting opportunity for us. And we know that, and you'll have to stay tuned.
Operator
And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back to our speakers for any closing remarks.
Thomas J. Szkutak
Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Fourth Quarter 2011 Financial Results Teleconference. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Sean Boyle. Please go ahead, sir.
Sean Boyle
Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2011 Financial Results Conference Call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO; and John Felton, our Director of Investor Relations. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, January 31, 2012, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K.
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.
During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliation of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2010. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas J. Szkutak
Thanks, Sean. I'll begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 12% to $3.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 17% to $2.09 billion. Return on invested capital is 22%, down from 34%. Return on invested capital is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends.
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 468 million shares compared with 465 million shares. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares of our common stock for $277 million.
Worldwide revenue grew 35% to $17.43 billion, or 34% excluding the $101 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We're grateful to our customers, who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers.
Media revenue increased to $6.01 billion, up 15% or 14% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $10.91 billion, up 48%, or 47% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 63% of worldwide sales, up from 57%.
Worldwide paid unit growth was 46%. Active customer accounts exceeded $164 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than $2 million. Seller units were 36% of paid units compared to 32% of paid units in Q4 2010.
Now I'll discuss our operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $13.83 billion, or 79.3% of revenue compared with 79.7%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $3.14 billion or 18% of sales, up approximately 250 basis points year-over-year.
Fulfillment was $1.62 billion or 9.3% of revenue compared with 8.2%. Tech and content was $782 million or 4.5% of revenue compared with 3.5%. Marketing was $581 million or 3.3% of revenue compared with 2.8%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results. And consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item.
In the North America segment, revenue grew 37% to $9.9 billion. Media revenue grew 8% to $2.56 billion. EGM revenue grew 51% to $6.88 billion, representing 69% of North America revenues, up from 63%.
North America segment operating income decreased 4% to $285 million, a 2.9% operating margin. In the International segment, revenue grew 31% to $7.53 billion. Adjusting for the $102 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 29%.
Media revenue grew 20% to $3.45 billion, or 18% excluding foreign exchange rates. And EGM revenue grew 42% to $4.03 billion, or 41% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 54% of international revenues, up from 49%.
International segment operating income decreased 46% to $177 million, a 2.4% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange rates, International segment operating income decreased 46%.
CSOI decreased 26% to $462 million, or 2.7% of revenue, down approximately 216 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased 27%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense.
GAAP operating income decreased 45% to $260 million, or 1.5% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $86 million in Q4, resulting in a 32% rate for the quarter and a 31% rate for the full year 2011. GAAP net income was $177 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, compared with $416 million and $0.91 per diluted share.
Now I'll discuss the full year results. Revenue grew 41% to $48.08 billion. North America revenue grew 43% to $26.71 billion, and International grew 38% to $21.37 billion, 31% growth excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates.
Consolidated Segment Operating Income, or CSOI, decreased 19% to $1.57 billion, or 21% excluding the favorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange. And operating margin decreased 239 basis points to 3.3%. GAAP operating income decreased 39% to $862 million, or 1.8% of net sales.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $814 million year-over-year to $9.58 billion. Inventory increased 56% to $4.99 billion. And inventory turns were 10.3, down from 11.4 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 38% to $11.14 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 74 from 72 in the prior year.
Our Q4 2011 capital expenditures were $550 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, including investments in technology, infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q1 2012, we expect net sales between $12 billion and $13.4 billion, a growth of between 22% and 36%. This guidance anticipates approximately 50 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.  GAAP operating income or loss to be between a loss of $200 million and $100 million of income, or between 162% decline and 69% decline. This includes approximately $200 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate Consolidated Segment Operating Income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between 0 and $300 million, or between 100% decline and 36% decline.
We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
Thanks. And with that, Sean, let's move to questions.
Sean Boyle
Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from analyst Jeetil Patel from Deutsche Bank Securities.
Jeetil J. Patel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
A couple of questions, actually. First of all, on the Kindle Fire, I guess, Tom, can you maybe talk about Kindle Fire hardware units? Or did you see an increase in terms of unit sales on a month-on-month basis in terms of linearity? Second, as it relates to fulfillment, can you talk about what's your thinking in terms of getting closer to the end consumer and trying to drop delivery times to same-day delivery as you kind of look forward in terms of planning and thinking of what's the optimal experience from a consumer standpoint?
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of data related to Kindle Fire and actually Kindle itself, the only thing I can help you with is on the holiday season, which we put in the release. We had a -- our unit sales nearly tripled. It was up 177%, and that includes both our Kindle e-reader and Kindle Fire. So we're very pleased with the great growth we had. And obviously, we've been growing quite fast over the last several years from a unit perspective in launching Kindle. So it's on a very good base. In terms of fulfillment and delivery time, we're continually trying to improve all of our processes around from a customer standpoint, and that includes fulfillment and delivery speed. And so you've seen over the last several years, we've gotten closer and closer to customers from a delivery speed standpoint. And when we do that, it not only helps our retail offering, but it helps also our third parties who are participating in Fulfilled by Amazon. And one of the things that you're seeing in our Q4 numbers is we saw very good unit growth. And you're seeing that we expanded our third party as a percentage of total units. And one of the ways we did that is certainly by Fulfilled by Amazon because again, from a customer standpoint, those units are available for express 2-day shipping or 1-day if you're a Prime member and you pay the small fee, as well as our free shipping offers.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from analyst Scott Devitt from Morgan Stanley.
Scott W. Devitt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Two if I could. The first one, Tom, North American segment sales decelerated, and if you can, adjustment for Kindle Fire, by a pretty good bit. You mentioned third-party mix, which I think is a negative impact on that, and was wondering if you could just talk through the other dynamics if Prime is becoming more mature in the U.S. and/or the agency book business, the mix shift you're having given the strength of the Kindle product, if that's actually having a negative impact on revenue growth?
Thomas J. Szkutak
Sure. In terms of our overall -- I'll talk to the total worldwide, as well as to the North America piece. But what I was mentioning was our growth rate for global revenue was 34%, excluding exchange. That compares to 39% in Q3 and 37% last year. If you compare our unit growth, that's a paid unit growth, was 46%. Again this is globally in Q4. That compares to 37% in Q4 last year. So we saw an acceleration in unit growth. On top of that, what we saw was third-party units grew 65% year-over-year, and our third-party units as a percentage of total units were 36%, up from 32%. And so really what you're seeing is you're seeing great adoption. Certainly, great revenue from a third-party perspective. But you're seeing very good adoption of FBA that has grown considerably over the last few years, and that's certainly impacting that number. But obviously, we only book a portion of the revenue based on the commissions we receive for that business and our top line growth. So that's what you're seeing in total. And you're seeing that also happen in North America, as well as International. To the other comments, a few other things to call out in terms of North America. If you take a look at our EGM revenue, certainly there was some impact in certain subcategories related to the Thailand flood. It certainly impacted some supply. Again, the good news is we certainly had some good third-party offerings in many of those subcategories as well. Same as -- another similar fact is in North America media, we saw very, very strong growth in digital media from books to video, music. All of those grew very well. We did see video games, which includes both consoles and games. Keep in mind that Q4 is very seasonal for video games. We actually saw our revenue decline year-over-year in video games. We had very strong third-party offerings, so our third-party growth was up. Our unit growth in video games was up, but our revenue was down. And that's what you're seeing impacting the North American media number, particularly versus Q4 last year. So again, those are some of the dynamics. But again, what you're seeing is some of this, certainly the strong performance on third-party sellers, is also impacting the top line, because we just recorded a portion of that sale, the commission. But you're seeing it positively impact operating income, which is why you see it came in a little bit above the guidance that we gave.
Scott W. Devitt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
And as it relates to CapEx, the run rate, if you go back to '05, you were about 2% -- a little over 2% of revenue, and it's been ramping. I know some of the last 2 years this included the building, but we exited 2012 I think at a 3.7% of revenue on a trailing basis. So I was wondering if you can just talk to the way that we should think about CapEx as a percentage of revenue or otherwise over the next few years.
Thomas J. Szkutak
Sure. We look at it certainly on an incremental -- from an incremental growth standpoint. And we look at it versus incremental unit growth, as well as what we think the NPVs for those specific investments are. But if you break down the individual pieces, again, as we've talked about in the last several calls, we've just seen such dramatic growth in both, first of all, from a retail perspective, on our retail offerings, been growing very fast. Our third-party with Fulfilled by Amazon, very fast. AWS has been growing very fast, and so the capacity that we've needed to support both our operations capability, as well as the infrastructure capability for our Web Services and our Retail business has been very high. That said, we feel that we're efficiently deploying that capital. We added -- as we talked about last call, we had planned to add 17 FCs, which is what we did in 2011, bringing our total to 69. And again, that represents the high growth that we're experiencing. So we feel very good about the investments that we're making. And with 46% paid unit growth in Q4, we're still experiencing very high growth.
Operator
Our next question is coming from analyst Mark Mahaney from the firm of Citi.
Mark S. Mahaney - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
Tom, just a little more color on that North American media growth. You talked about the unit trends and the revenue trends in video games. Anything you'd want to call out in terms of the other media segments: books, music and video? And then real briefly, the share buybacks. I think this is the first time in at least 2 years you've done that. Any particular reason why you brought back stock in the quarter?
Thomas J. Szkutak
Sure. In terms of the North American media, again, across all of digital media, very strong growth. Another call-out that I didn't mention is physical books. Unit growth was double digit in Q4 year-over-year, which we were very pleased with if you think about the shift to digital content and just the really rapid growth on the Kindle side. We were pleased to see that. And then I'd mentioned the video games was again down from a revenue perspective. Third-party GMS was up strongly. Unit growth in total for video games was up. Again, there's some difficult compares as you can imagine with some of the console piece of that. And again, when I talk video games, it's both console and video games. And keep in mind that video games in particular is very seasonal, and usually, we see in Q4, and we did see this Q4 as well as other Q4s, that video games sales for the quarter is multiples of what we see in other quarters, again because of the seasonality. So hopefully that's helpful. And then in terms of the stock purchase, we've had a -- there's not a lot to comment there. We have said in the past that we'll opportunistically buy when we think it's the right value, and that's what we did.
Operator
Our next question is coming from analyst Spencer Wang from the firm of Crédit Suisse.
Spencer Wang - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Tom, 2 quick questions. One is, I think the new disclosure on service sales, maybe I missed the footnote in the press release, could you just clarify what's included there? Is that 3P, FBA, Prime, AWS and shipping? Or did I maybe miss something? And then secondly, can you share with us maybe your plans for how many fulfillment centers you plan on opening in 2012?
Thomas J. Szkutak
Sure. In terms of the disclosure, I would want to guide you right to the release to see exactly what's included in there. But certainly, in terms of some of the big pieces, it is our third-party. It is also AWS and a number of other service offerings. And so those are again documented well there, and I'd like to point you to that. Also, you can see that it's growing very well, and it reflects on the comments I made earlier about the fast-growing AWS businesses, the fast-growing third-party business. Service revenue is up approximately 74% year-over-year in Q4. And then in terms of fulfillment, we added 17 new FCs in 2011. That's globally. We do plan, based on the strong growth, to add more in 2012. As you can imagine, coming out of Q4, we're finalizing our plans for what we're going to do there. And you'll have to stay tuned, and we'll keep you updated as we go throughout the year.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Youssef Squali with Jefferies & Company as the firm.
Youssef H. Squali - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division
So going back to the media question, Tom, can you maybe just help us quantify the video games revenue impact, maybe just on the level of deceleration? We would've thought that maybe with the launch of Kindle Fire, et cetera, we would've seen maybe a higher attach rate and therefore, maybe a higher media revenue growth. And second, just on the streaming service, any plans to separate -- to offer separate pricing for the video streaming product? And that's it.
Thomas J. Szkutak
Yes, just to be clear, I'm separating our digital -- when I talk about our growth rates, I'm talking about our digital content businesses across-the-board grew very strongly during Q4. The video games, physical, as well as consoles business, again grows. It's just seasonally very high. It's not -- if you take a look at it, it's not too dissimilar to what you'd see with our electronics portion of our EGM business. It's a very seasonal business, very heavy weighted in Q4. And so that's no different. That's not different this year than in other years. What is different is growth was down from a revenue perspective year-over-year. It was up from a units perspective. And again, the reason why it was up is because we had strong third-party sales in Q4. Keep in mind though, certainly console is a part of that. And again, we include consoles and video games as part of our video games line within North America media. And you've probably seen other press related to that as you look at other releases and updates. But there has been a lot of new offerings there recently.
Youssef H. Squali - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division
And on the video streaming?
Thomas J. Szkutak
I'm sorry, what was your question on that? Could you repeat it again?
Youssef H. Squali - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division
Just on the video streaming side, trying to figure out whether there are any other short-term plans to offer -- to strip that out basically from Kindle from the Prime and offer it as a standalone offering?
Thomas J. Szkutak
Well, for digital video, we have a couple different offerings. One is a paid or rental offering as part of Amazon Video. We also have a service as part of Prime. We like both of them. We made some -- we put some comments in the release about the growth rates associated with those. And on the Prime that's in Video, we actually like what we see there also. And so it's still early, but we like what we see. We are investing in digital content. We're seeing great adoption. We're looking at it very carefully to understand a lot of different metrics around that business as you'd expect. And it's still early again. We really like what we see so far. We're going to continue to monitor it closely, but we will be continuing to add content there.
Operator
And our next question is coming from analyst Heather Bellini with firm, Goldman Sachs.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
I was wondering if you could comment a little bit about any cannibalization you think you saw in traditional Kindle readers as a result of the Fire launch. And subsequently, how are you feeling about the Prime conversion of the Fire units versus your expectations?
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of both devices, meaning the readers and Fire, did very well and we're very pleased with the growth we're seeing there. And that's part of the -- both are included in the growth rate that we had in our release, which is again during the holiday season. It was up 177% year-over-year. And again, we've been growing certainly our Kindle reader business very fast over the past several years since introduction. And so it's on top of a good base. And so we're pleased with the growth rate, and customers like both the reader and the Fire. Early to tell on Prime conversion. But again, early stats that we're seeing, we like a lot. And so we'll continue to see how that looks going forward, but we like what we're seeing.
Operator
Our next question is coming from analyst Justin Post with firm Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Your headcount growth in the quarter was 67%, which is quite a bit higher than units or revenue growth. Can you talk about what all those people are focused on, maybe a couple of the bigger areas? And is there are day coming when you could envision that kind of slowing to below either unit or revenue growth with maybe the timeframe on that?
Thomas J. Szkutak
Sure. First thing is we are investing in a lot of different areas across the business, as we've talked about. That being said, when you look at that increase that you're referring to, the majority of those increases are in our operations and customer service area. And so again, it's in support of the growth. And certainly, you're seeing it also in our operating costs. And again, we're fortunate to have a lot of opportunities. We're fortunate to have the growth that we're experiencing, and that's why you're seeing that growth. But certainly, you'll see that. As you have over time, you'll see that growth rate will go in cycles. But we certainly are feeding the growth that we're seeing and the opportunities that we have.
Operator
And our next question is coming from Jordan Rohan with the firm Stifel, Nicolaus.
Jordan Rohan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
So I'm trying to better understand the guided range for 1Q. And specifically, I'm looking at 2 things. First, the impact of currency and really more macro weakness in Western Europe. Are you seeing anything there? Is there anything that makes you think that things could be getting materially worse in any of your territories? And specific language around which of the countries you may be seeing could be quite helpful. And second, I'm wondering if you are seeing, or have seen over the course of the last quarter, a shift of consumer buying habits towards the hardware device sales and away from media, and perhaps that could explain the deceleration in the media that we appear to be seeing in North America.
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of international growth or in terms of, first of all, your question on guidance and the impact of exchange, we have a modest assumption around exchanges. Again, we're using the recent exchange rates. But the range for growth was 22% to 36%, and it was unfavorably impacting us by about 50 basis points for foreign exchange. In terms of growth in, you mentioned Western Europe, if you take a look at International in Q4, it was up 29% on a local-currency basis. It did hold up pretty well given obviously the challenges that are going on, specifically in Europe from an economic standpoint. We're not -- we don't view ourselves as a bellwether for the economy, but certainly we're seeing that it is softer. Hard to quantify how much higher that international growth would have been. But it was certainly -- we're all seeing the same thing in terms of the reports in Europe and it's certainly soft. So it is impacting our overall growth rate, but hard to tell how much. And then on the -- again on the North America media growth, it's actually again very, very strong on the digital content side. Physical books were up double digits from a unit perspective, which we thought was impressive given the shift to Kindle. And again, video games and video game consoles were certainly the biggest call-out there from a negative standpoint. And that growth was down year-over-year on a revenue basis but up from a unit perspective.

Our next question is from analyst Gene Munster with the firm of Piper Jaffray.
Charles Eugene Munster - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division
If we just take a step back and look at this from a high level, over the last couple of years, you've been making significant investments in the business, and it's been paying off with just some impressive growth numbers off of what have been larger and larger numbers. And I think the big surprise for investors tonight is just what appears to be a diminishing return on that investment. And I don't know if you can use this as a forum to kind of address that concern.
Thomas J. Szkutak
Yes, I'm not sure how to answer that, or exactly what you mean. What I would say is we have been investing very heavily as you mentioned. And as a result of that, Q4 unit growth was 46% year-over-year. That's paid unit growth. And we see a lot of opportunity in front of us. And yes, there's some pockets of softness or challenges with some of the economic impact, particularly in Europe. We did see some supply issues with the Thailand flood, with certainly some subcategories within some of our hard lines businesses as a result. We think those things will work themselves out over time. But we're incredibly optimistic about the opportunity that we have, and that's why we have invested the way we have and why we're continuing to invest in the business. So we're very pleased to see it and very pleased to have the opportunities that we have in front of us.
Charles Eugene Munster - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division
Okay. So your outlook in terms of investment philosophy hasn't changed versus last quarter going forward.
Thomas J. Szkutak
No, no. We're continuing to look. As we always do, we learn every week and every month and every quarter about more and more about customer adoption. And we're looking at just a lot of positive things across the business in terms of adoption of our digital offerings, very specifically Kindle growth from a device standpoint and the content that's following that. And we're seeing some very strong growth along many categories. If you look at EGM, we're seeing very good growth in categories like soft lines, particularly clothing. We're seeing very good growth in consumables. We're seeing very good growth outside of some of these supply-constrained areas. Within consumer electronics, we're seeing good growth. So there's a lot of positive things within EGM. Within our business, we're seeing just tremendous growth in Amazon Web Services, so I'm very pleased with how the team is doing there, and they're just doing a great job. And so there's a lot of interesting opportunities that we continue to invest in. So we're very pleased, and we're very pleased with the performance in Q4 and what it means going forward for us.
Operator
Our last question is from analyst Doug Anmuth with the firm of JP Morgan.
Douglas Anmuth - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Just a couple things. So you're obviously building a lot into Prime with video and also the Kindle Lending Library. Can you just give us a sense of how the profitability of a Prime customer changes over time? And then also, if you could comment more specifically on the early returns on sort of the media rate -- media purchases as it relates to Kindle Fire owners specifically?
Thomas J. Szkutak
Sure. In each of our video -- excuse me, in each of our digital contents that we're offering, whether it be as part of Prime, whether it be Lending Library or whether it be video, we just have early results. And so from a return perspective, we're going to see -- what we can see so far is what's happening with adoption of Prime members, what's happening with free trial conversion, what's happening with Prime memberships that we can attribute directly to those services. And again, it's very, very early. But so far, we see, we like, which is why we're continuing down the path specifically of adding more content to Prime and making Prime better. And so that's something that we, over time, we've learned both with our physical offerings and now early on in our digital offering, it's something that we think is very good for customers and very good for share owners. And so that's something that we're focused a lot on. Because we're investing a lot there, we are taking a very close look at and making sure that we understand it very well. And from what we see so far, it supports a continued strong investment there. And so that's what we're doing. But again, we'll continue to monitor that very closely. And over time, we'll be sharing more about how we're doing there.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Third Quarter 2011 Financial Results Teleconference. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Mr. John Felton. Please go ahead, sir.
John Felton
Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2011 Financial Results Conference Call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views, as of today, October 25, 2011, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. 
Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K.
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.
During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. 
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2010.
Now, I will turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas J. Szkutak
Thanks, John. I'll begin with comments in our third quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 19% to $3.11 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 17% to $1.53 billion. Return on invested capital is 17%, down from 28%.
Return on invested capital is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter end. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 469 million shares compared with 465 million shares. 
Worldwide revenue grew 44% to $10.88 billion or 39%, excluding the $371 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. We are grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage for our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers. 
Media revenue increased to $4.15 billion, up 24% or 19%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $6.32 billion, up 59% or 54%, excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 58% of worldwide sales, up from 53%. 
Worldwide paid unit growth was 53%. Active customer accounts exceeded 152 million. Worldwide active sellers were more than 2 million. 
Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $8.32 billion or 76.5% of revenue consistent with the prior-year period. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $2.29 billion or 21.1% of sales, up approximately 290 basis points year-over-year. 
Fulfillment was $1.09 billion or 10% of revenue compared with 8.7%. Tech and content was $694 million or 6.4% of revenue compared with 5.1%. Marketing was $360 million or 3.3% of revenue compared with 3.1%. 
Now I'll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate segments or stock-based type of compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North American segment, revenue grew 44% to $5.93 billion. Media revenue grew 21% to $1.93 billion. EGM revenue grew 56% to $3.64 billion, representing 51% of North American revenues, up from 56%. 
North America segment operating income decreased 23% to $144 million, a 2.4% operating margin. 
In the International segment, revenue grew 44% to $4.94 billion, adjusting for the $367 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 33%. 
Media revenue grew 27% to $2.23 billion or 17% excluding foreign exchange and EGM revenue grew 63% to $2.68 million or 51%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 54% of international revenues up from 48%. 
International segment operating income decreased 46% to $116 million, a 2.4% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign exchange, International segment operating income decreased 55%. 
Consolidated segment operating income decreased 35% to $260 million or 2.4% of revenue down approximately 290 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $14 million favorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased 38%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income include stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 71% to $79 million or 0.7% of net sales. 
Our income tax expense was $67 million in Q3, resulting in a 52% rate for the quarter and a 31% rate year-to-date. GAAP net income was $63 million or $0.14 per diluted share compared with $231 million and $0.51 per diluted share. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $441 million year-over-year to $6.33 billion. Inventory increased 50% to $3.77 billion and inventory turns were 10.8, down from 11.8 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. 
Accounts payable increased 42% to $6.55 billion and accounts payable days decreased to 72 from 73 in the prior year. Our Q3 2011 capital expenditures were $529 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, including investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web services and capacity to support our fulfillment operations. 
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into the guidance are the trends that we've seen to date, and what we believed today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand. And therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling inter-company balances in foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters in changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q4 2011, we expect net sales between $16.45 billion and $18.65 billion or growth between 27% and 44%. This guidance anticipates approximately 130 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange. 
GAAP operating income or loss to be between $200 million loss and $250 million of income are between a 142% decline and 47% decline. This includes approximately $200 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $0 and $450 million or between 100% decline and 28% decline. 
We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to creating lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, John, let's move to questions.
John Felton
Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Mark Mahaney with Citi.
Mark S. Mahaney - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
I wonder if you would talk a little bit more about the revenue guide for the fourth quarter? And just some basic factual things, are you including contributions from the Kindle Fire shipments? And do you fully recognize all of that or is there some ratable recognition? And is there any particular reason, in addition to that, that you're guiding for a deceleration? Are you seeing signs of softening consumer demand in European markets, for example?
Thomas J. Szkutak
Sure. In terms of the guidance for revenue for Q4, as we've done in previous years, we've given a wide range of guidance in Q4 just because of the seasonality and it's difficult to predict. But we feel very good about the demand that we've seen to date. And certainly, at the high end of the guidance, you can see there's an acceleration that's possible that's reflected in that guidance. But we are given a wide range consistent with what we've done in prior Q4s. In terms of the overall growth that we've seen so far, to date, you saw a very strong growth in Q3, up 39% on a local currency basis. That's consistent with what we've seen over the past 12 months where we're up 39%, also over the trailing 12 months. And we really saw a step change 2 years ago where last [indiscernible] year-over-year so far last 12 months up 39%. So again, we feel very good about the growth that we are experiencing, and I've seen data reflected in the guidance given a wide range. In terms of Kindle Fire in our guidance and certainly  the largest portion of that would be reflected in our revenue.
Operator
We'll go next to Youssef Squali with Jefferies & Company.
Youssef H. Squali - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division
Tom, could you please speak to what's pressuring margins in Q3 and particularly Q4. I guess the implied margin for Q4 is effectively 0 at the midpoint. It, again, answer the question, what's the financial model going forward? Is it to try to maximize growth on the top line even at 0 growth -- 0 margin?
Thomas J. Szkutak
What you're seeing, and again, it relates back to the growth, we're  seeing really unprecedented growth. We're seeing the best growth which we've seen since 2000, meaning in 2010 and so far over the past 12 months ending September. And so with this strong growth, we're investing in a lot of capacity and that's what we've been talking about over the past couple of quarters and that's what you're seeing in our Q3 results specifically. If you take a look at our operating expenses in Q3, as a percentage of revenue, you see -- and if you compare that to Q2, as a percentage of revenue, you're seeing very similar trends for marketing and G&A. You're seeing a slight uptick in tech content. It's about 10 basis points and then you're seeing fulfillment up approximately 80 basis points. The reason why that's growing so much, as a percentage of revenue, is again the capacity that we've been talking about. Many days ago, I've mentioned that we were -- we had announced 15 new fulfillment centers this year that's on a basis of 52 from last year. And then we'd likely open one or two more. We are  actually going to be opening 17 new fulfillment centers. And so you're seeing that impacting our fulfillment expense in Q3, as well as the bottom line in Q3. So that's what's impacting this in Q3. We are also investing in a number of different areas. We're investing to support retail growth fulfilled by Amazon growth, fast-growing AWS business, as well as infrastructure to support our retail business. We're investing in our Kindle and Digital business. I mean you're seeing that reflected in our Q4 guidance as well, all of these things. And so if you take a look at our Kindle business, for example, we've launched 4 new products at the end of September, and we're very, very excited about those products. They're at great prices, and they are certainly premium products. And so we're very excited about those. And we think about the economics of the Kindle business, we think about the totality. We think of the lifetime value of those devices. So we're not just thinking about the economics of the device and the accessories. We're thinking about the content. We are selling quite a bit of Special Offers devices which includes ads. We're thinking about the advertisement and those Special Offers and those lifetime values. So those are the things certainly that are impacting, as well as investments in other areas impacting our Q4 guidance. But we feel very good about where we are right now and the opportunities that we have in front of us.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.
Scott W. Devitt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Tom, just a bigger picture question on the Retail business. I was wondering how you're thinking about individual markets in cases where specific markets are highly competitive and markets where you maybe position potentially as the #2. Do you, long-term in markets such as that do you believe that the business should be positioned as #1 and that the scale advantage has deteriorated if you're not a #1. Just wondering given some of the emerging markets and the competitive landscape that's occurring, particularly in Asia. How  you think about that?
Thomas J. Szkutak
Sure. We're -- maybe to step back from it a bit. Whenever we enter a new geography or even a new category, we're trying to make sure that it's something that we can, we think we can add value to. And so, for example, we like categories that have a lot of different SKUs that are complicated in a physical retail environment. We like categories where there is, we think that we can add a lot of value from a service perspective. And so in each of the categories that we operate in, we're always trying to make sure that we can -- we think we can get great returns on invested capital over a period of time. And so I'm not directly answering your question, but we certainly look at it on a category-by-category basis. We look at it where we can add value. And if you look back over of our history, you can see where we've entered new categories, new geographies. We've always started with the customer first. We've added  selection usually first from a retail standpoint. Sometimes with third parties it starts, sometimes not. But we've added third parties as we've gone if we haven't done it what we started. And so this is -- we think this model has worked very well for us. And again, we're  looking always at ways that we can add value for customers and shareholders over time.
Operator
Next, we'll go to Jim Friedland with Cowen and Company.
James H. Friedland - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division
I wanted to ask about -- you with Netflix launching. We're announcing that they're launching in the U.K. and Ireland with streaming. You guys bought Lovefilm earlier in the year and it doesn't seem like you've changed the streaming side of the business that much. Are there any plans to ramp up the investment and content outside the U.S., outside of what you're doing with Prime streaming? And then on Quidsi, we've seen a lot of new announcements in terms of new brands and also new categories. Is that having a material impact on some of the lower operating profiters. Quidsi is just not big enough as a percentage of total to matter?
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of Lovefilm, actually we have been investing in content since acquisition. So that's something we have been doing and we continue to invest there and you'd expect -- you should expect us to continue to invest in Lovefilm. We think it's a graded opportunity. The business is doing very well. We're very pleased with how the team is working and we're very excited about that opportunity. So that's something we have been doing since acquisition. And you should expect that to continue. In terms of Quidsi, yes, they are continuing to expand, doing a very nice job. That is not -- it certainly reflected in the guidance that we're giving for Q4. I wouldn't consider that a material impact.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Ross Sandler with RBC Capital Markets.
Ross Sandler - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
Just two quick questions. First on U.S. EGM, there was a bit more deceleration there than  prior quarters. I know that comp was more challenging, but can you give us a little color on what's going on with the deceleration in domestic EGM? And then a question on mobile, our smart phone and tablet users that are buying physical goods on the Amazon mobile app, how does their purchase behavior differ from the same users who are buying stuff on PC? Are they buying more physical goods or less, not ebooks or digital goods, but just specifically physical goods?
Thomas J. Szkutak
Sure. In terms of the first part of your question, we are very pleased with the growth rate we saw in North America EGM. It was up 56% year-over-year. And you do have it right. It is a bit of a tough compare if you look back to last year. We did grow 80%. It was certainly high watermark for us and we're overlapping that. We had very, very strong growth last year Q3. But again, still very pleased with what we see in Q3 of this year in EGM specifically and our overall growth rates, too. In terms of mobile, we actually haven't released a lot of details and that's not much I can help you with there. But certainly, we are seeing good trends in our mobile business. And again, we like what we're  seeing there, but there's not much I can help you with that particular question.
Operator
We'll go next to Jeetil Patel from Deutsche Bank Securities.
Jeetil J. Patel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
A couple of questions. First of all, I guess on lifetime value, if you look at the Kindle kind of customer versus the core retail customer, can you talk about whether lifetime value is comparable or higher, relative to that core business? If you can isolate it that way? And second, as you look at the third-party business, are you seeing an accelerated mixed shift towards third-party broadly? And is there anything -- any particular markets or kind of international that seems to be seeing a bigger pickup in the third-party side of the business?
Thomas J. Szkutak
To answer your first -- the first part of your question, we're not breaking out Kindle customer versus non-Kindle customer, but I can talk a little bit about some of the dynamics related specifically to the Kindle customer. We have learned a lot over the past couple of years about -- since launching Kindle. Once a customer's purchased a device, obviously, what else do they buy. And what they launch  more recently of special offers and ad-based Kindles. We certainly have some data and we're still learning, but have some data that we didn't have prior to launch. And so what we're seeing certainly is that once customers purchase a Kindle and are carrying around this really massive selection at their fingertips, they're buying more content. We've talked a lot about that on previous calls. But again as we think about the lifetime value, we thinking very specifically about the device itself. How to make sure that we get just the absolute device in customers -- the absolute best device in customers hands and have the absolute best content on those devices. And we look at the total economics which include the device, the accessories, the content, as well as any ad-based revenue and Special Offers. So those are the things that we're looking at, as we think about the lifetime value of the device. And we like what we see. And so certainly as you think about Q4 and you think about the guidance that we're giving, certainly we're going to have a -- we expect to have a record quarter in terms of device sales. And because of the back-end loading of it, you should assume that the content would, obviously, trail that device sale. The ad revenue would trail those device sales as well as the Special Offers. So those are the things you should think about as you think about our Kindle business. But we're extremely excited about it both our electronic ink and fire devices and couldn't be more pleased to offer those for customers and we think that those will be great for share owners over time. In terms of third-party, we think the business is going very well, in terms of the numbers. Our third-party units, as a percentage of total units, these are paid units, as a percentage of total units is 38% this quarter, up from 35% last year. So we're very pleased also on top  have very strong overall unit growth, so we're  very pleased with what we're seeing there. And this is a trend that's been -- you've seen for a number of years now, where we're getting both great retail growth, as well as third-party growth. And certainly fulfilled by Amazon and other things that are helping drive that growth rate.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse.
Spencer Wang - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
So I guess one question and a couple of parts related to digital content. Tom I was wondering if you could just perhaps give us a sense of how much of the increase in operating costs in the fourth quarter do you think will be driven by digital content rights? Should we expect that to continue to drag on into 2012? And then just to clarify, how are you accounting for the streaming content rights? Is that under FAS 63?
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of content, we will be certainly purchasing content for both our U.S. business which includes a paid piece and a Prime instant video which will be an unpaid piece free as long as you're a Prime member. And so those -- so the content is included in our Q4. In addition to that, we also have content costs as we have with Lovefilm in Europe, so those are included in our guidance. We are not splitting out the specific dollar amount related to that in our guidance for Q4. But it's certainly impacting our guidance, along with, certainly investing in our Kindle business and some of the other investments that I talked about. So those are the things that are impacting us, and we're excited to -- for those opportunities.
Operator
And we'll go next to Ben Schachter with Macquarie Group.
Benjamin A. Schachter - Macquarie Research
So my understanding is that Google will be the default search engine for the Kindle Fire. But will the Silk browser have any type of interface or search bar that links directly to either physical product or media directly from Amazon? And then just separately, on the video distribution, you're still not on the game consoles. Any update on why and would you consider deploying any device like a Roku box or anything else directly to prime customers so that they can get video content to a [indiscernible]?
Thomas J. Szkutak
It'll  be very easy on Fire to access all of our digital content at first. So it's very integrated device. It's something that we've been working on. It's coming together over long period of time, in terms of being able to offer just a vast amount of paid and free content. In the case of video, we'll certainly have  book content, music content. So it will be a very -- our App Store as well. So it will be very easy and very integrated being able to access all of our digital content. It'll  also be easy to access physical product as well. So those are things that we're very excited about, and customers will be able to see when they receive their Fire. And so we think it's an incredible product. We're very excited about it. It's certainly a premium product. And at $1.99, it's certainly not a premium price. We're  very happy to offer that to customers. In terms of other things we might do, I don't have anything to speak of there.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Herman Leung with Susquehanna.
Herman Leung - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division
Two quick questions. First, I guess on the Target cost drop, I think Target drop -- is dropping basically in August. So wondering what the impact of that is from a onetime cost standpoint in the third and fourth quarters. And then the second quick question is on the distribution center ramp, the 17 new distribution centers that you're adding, how long would it take for those distribution centers to operate at normalized levels similar to your 52 other distribution centers?
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of Target, we're not breaking out any specific partner relationship. But certainly, in terms of you have the timing right, in terms of that did happen during Q3. We're  very fortunate to be able to partner with Target over a number of years and so we're very happy to have done that, and so that relationship ended from a partnering of their website in Q3. And any associated impact has been reflected in our actual results for Q3 and our guidance for Q4.  And then in terms of the FCs, the way you should think about it is think about just the sheer ramp up of going from 52 to 69 FCs in a year. It's happening very fast. We have a fantastic team around the world who has been working very hard, making sure that we're up and running, and we have all of our associates train. That being said, as you can imagine, we're having people come in well before starting fulfillment for training. We are signing leases and getting product available for shipment well before doing so. And so, consequently, just as a result of having a ramp up where they'll  be no output for some period of time even though we'll have people in building someplace and moving, receiving product in as productive downtime. And then there's a timeframe where it takes to ramp up during -- from a distribution standpoint. And so all these things will take time. It's something that we have been doing since the start of Amazon. It's something that I think we understand very well, and it takes a period of time depending upon the FC and how automated it is or non automated it is. So those -- all of those factors, we certainly understand well and we'll certainly feel very good about deploying those assets and get great returns on invested capital on those assets over time.

We'll take our next question from Brian Pitz with UBS.
Brian J. Pitz - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Just two quick questions. Would you provide any color on current traction with the Cloud Player and/or usage of Prime video? And going forward, is there any chance that we could see the video service unbundled from Prime perhaps with a standalone fee? I know it's kind of a forward look but it's just how -- can we think about -- how can we think about that?
Thomas J. Szkutak
We're happy with the traction we're getting, both the Cloud Player and Prime video -- both from very early. In terms of Prime video, customers absolutely love it. It's free video. We're adding a lot of content there. We have a lot of customers who are requesting free trials, and then the converting base on those free trials. This is the Prime trials. And so it's very early. And it's something that we'll be adding to, certainly, over the course of the next 12 months and we feel very good about that. But we're also monitoring it very carefully, and we're watching all of the customer-facing metrics that we can, as well as looking at the economics. So that we feel that it's very early, but we like what we see so far.
Operator
Our next question will come from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.
Douglas Anmuth - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Two things. First, Tom, we've seen in the past sometimes when companies make changes to the site, in terms of the UI that it can take customers a little time to get adjusted to those. Can you comment on what you're seeing in the early impact on your site and how that plays into the 4Q? If it does at all? And then secondly, can you comment on whether you're paying any royalties around the Kindle Fire?
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of the UI, there's not a lot I can say there. It's certainly that's probably the most recent data would be to look at our Q3 results. We didn't have the new UI at 100% for the full quarter. But again, we saw a very strong growth rate in Q3. As I've mentioned earlier, up 39%, so we feel very good about it and it's certainly reflected in our actual results in our guidance as I've mentioned earlier. If you think about Q4, we think we'll have certainly, we've added a lot of selections over the past 12 months, a lot of great unique selection, so we think we are well positioned for Q4 from a selection standpoint. We continue to make sure that our prices are sharp, so we have great value to customers. We continue to work on improving service levels that comes in a number of different forms, but certainly getting goods to customers fast is important and certainly Prime is playing a key role on that and we have certainly a lot more Prime members this year than we have previously. So all of those things we have 4 new Kindle products at just great prices for customers. So all those attributes set up Q4 for a nice growth quarter. Although as we have another Q4 because again our -- but again, we feel very, very good about the growth that we're  seeing over the past quarter and our prospects for the holiday season. And that's reflected in the guidance that we're giving. And in terms of specifics on royalties and everything, we certainly wouldn't talk to that.
Operator
We'll go next to Colin Sebastian with R.W. Baird.
Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
Just one follow-up on the fulfillment centers, Tom. I think you mentioned before that you might need to increase beyond the 15 new centers if revenue growth were faster than originally expected. If you could confirm that, that was the thought process here as well looking into Q4? And then just on the Kindle Fire and EE  devices based on your comments on sales trends thus far, is there any potential supply constraints that you foresee for the holiday period?
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of the first part, in terms of fulfillment centers, yes. As I mentioned 90 days ago, we've given a range of guidance for the top line for Q3. We hadn't given guidance for Q4. We were very excited about the growth that we were seeing through the first half of the year, but we wanted to get through Q3. And again, I'd announced or had mentioned that 90 days ago that we had announced that we were opening 15 and potentially 1 or 2 more. And that reality is coming true. We are actually opening up 17. And so -- and again, that illustrates we feel about -- how we feel about, not the growth that's happened in the past. But certainly impacting how we're thinking about it, but it impacts the fulfillment we're adding is about growth going forward. And so we feel very good about the growth they're  experiencing and we're looking at a number of different factors, including our most recent historical growth rates. In terms of supply, you probably saw the release. But again, in the first 3 weeks since launch, orders for our EE  Kindles are double the previous launch. We're also seeing extremely strong Kindle Fire pre-orders and we're increasing capacity in building millions more than already planned. And so that's what we're doing from a production standpoint, and we're getting ready as you'd expect for just a great holiday season for customers overall and for Kindle customers.
Operator
We'll go next to Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo.
Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
First, your employee count is up about 19% sequentially versus a move of about 10% over the last few years. So I'm wondering, is this quarter and next quarter when you hire a lot of temporary workers  sort of the apex of the pain that you'll feel on all these new FCs or do you think that employee growth could actually accelerate in the first half of next year? And then secondly, your shipping costs were also up pretty significantly, how much of that is Prime usage versus Prime customer acquisition cost?
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of employment, we're not guiding or giving estimates beyond the quarter. But you're right, we're seeing a large sequential increase in employment and a large year-over-year increase in employment, and it's across many different areas that we're adding. But certainly the most notable, both from a year-over-year and sequential and certainly represents the majority of the additions would be our operations and customer service associates. And so those are certainly growing fast, and we're also -- given the opportunity that we have to grow. We're also investing in other areas. But again, the majority of the sequential and year-over-year increase is coming from operations and customer service associates. In terms of the shift margin as you're mentioning, certainly, Prime is certainly having a big impact there. And so as well as our free shipping offers and so that's what's -- that certainly what's driving it.
Operator
And we have time for one final question, we'll go to Kerry Rice with Needham & Company.
Kerry K. Rice - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division
I know that you guys launched in Spain this quarter or towards the end of Q3 beginning of Q4. Can you talk a little bit about maybe the additional international strategy? Shall we think of that as the first step further into Europe or maybe into Latin America?
Thomas J. Szkutak
Sure. In terms of the 2 most recent country launches, we're certainly Spain and Italy and it's very early. It's a -- we're very happy to be, certainly, serving those geographies. We're very excited about it and think they're  very interesting long-term opportunities. We have, we're able to take advantage of our European infrastructure and leadership team to launch those 2 geographies, and we're very excited about it.
John Felton

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Second Quarter 2011 Financial Results Teleconference. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Mr. John Felton. Please go ahead.
John Felton
Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2011 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views, as of today, July 26, 2011, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K.
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.
During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. 
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2010. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas Szkutak
Thanks, John. I'll begin with comments on our second quarter financial results. Trailing 12 month operating cash flow increased 25% to $3.21 billion. Trailing 12 months free cash flow decreased 8% to $1.83 billion. Return on invested capital is 21%, down from 34%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 468 million shares compared with 465 million shares. 
Worldwide revenue grew 51% to $9.91 billion or 44%, excluding the $477 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers. 
Media revenue increased to $3.66 billion, up 27% or 20% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $5.89 billion, up 69% or 62%, excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 59% of worldwide sales, up from 53%. 
Worldwide paid unit growth was 56% compared to 45% paid unit growth in Q1 2011. Active customer accounts exceeded $144 million. 
Worldwide active seller accounts were more than $2 million. Seller units were 36% of paid units compared to 36% of paid units in Q1 2011 and 34% of paid units in Q2 2010. 
Now, I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $7.52 billion or 75.9% of revenue compared with 75.5%. Fulfillment, Marketing, Technology and Content and G&A combined was $2 billion or 20.2% of sales, up approximately 190 basis points year-over-year. 
Fulfillment was $909 million or 9.2% of revenue compared with 8.5%. Tech and content was $624 million or 6.3% of revenue compared with 5.3%. Marketing was $331 million or 3.3% of revenue compared with 3.1%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. 
In the North America segment, revenue grew 51% to $5.41 billion. Adjusting for the $3 million year-over-year of favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 50%. Media revenue grew 20% to $1.58 billion. EGM revenue grew 67% to $3.5 billion, representing 65% of North America revenues, up from 58%. North America segment operating income increased 7% to $214 million, a 4% operating margin. 
In the International segment, revenue grew 51% to $4.51 billion, adjusting for the $473 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 36%. 
Media revenue grew 34% to $2.07 billion or 20%, excluding foreign exchange, and EGM revenue grew 71% to $2.4 billion or 53%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 53% of international revenues, up from 47%. 
International segment operating income decreased 16% to $172 million, a 3.8% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign exchange, International segment operating income decreased 34%. CSOI decreased 5% to $386 million or 3.9% of revenue, down 229 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $28 million favorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased 12%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 25% to $201 million or 2% of net sales. 
Our income tax expense was $49 million in Q2, resulting in a 22% rate for the quarter and a 26% rate year-to-date. GAAP net income was $191 million or $0.41 per diluted share compared with $207 million and $0.45 per diluted share. Second quarter 2011 net income was positively impacted by equity method investment activity of $15 million, including the $49 million gain on sale of an equity position partially offset by $34 million in losses from equity method investments. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $1.25 billion year-over-year to $6.36 billion. Inventory increased 66% to $3.23 billion and inventory turns were 11.3, down from 12.5 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. 
Accounts payable increased 61% to $5.72 billion and accounts payable days increased to 69 from 65 in the prior year. Our Q2 2011 capital expenditures were $433 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, including investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services, capacity to support our fulfillment operations and investments in corporate office space. 
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date, and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling inter-company balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. 
Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q3 2011, we expect net sales between $10.3 billion and $11.1 billion or growth of between 36% and 47%. This guidance anticipates approximately 450 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be between $20 million and $170 million or between 93% decline and 37% decline. This includes approximately $180 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate Consolidated Segment Operating Income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $200 million and $350 million or between a 50% decline and a 13% decline. 
We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection, and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, John, let's move to questions.
John Felton
Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Jim Friedland with Cowen and Company.
James Friedland - Cowen and Company, LLC
I wanted to ask a question about how you think about ROI and free cash flow, as you invest really aggressively to support this 50% growth. We are seeing free cash flow levels depressed in the near term. And how long can this -- do you expect this to continue? If you keep grabbing shares, should we continue to expect pressure, in terms of free cash flow? Just trying to get a sense of how we should think about incremental capital invested.
Thomas Szkutak
Sure. In terms of how we think about these investments. Our approach has been pretty consistent over the years. If you look at the, as you mentioned, the strong growth, this is the strongest growth we've had from a quarterly perspective year-over-year and over 10 years. And as a result of that, as we look forward, there's a requirement for a lot of capacity and it's something I talked about on previous calls. And if you think about our capacity, it comes in a number of different forms. First of all, our core Retail business. We need both fulfillment capacity, as well as infrastructure capacity. This is something that we've been doing really since our inception and I look at it as a high quality problem. We have a -- if you back out cash and marketable securities, you see that we have a high ROIC. I'm not saying that's really a historical performance, it's not necessarily a predictive performance, but I do feel very good about those investments. Those are something that we've done before. And it's something that we've been working to perfect really since we opened our doors back in the mid-90s. In terms of there's another set of investments certainly you're seeing we're investing in the conversion from physical to digital. We think we have good assets to do that. We're very focused on the customer experience. And that comes in a number of different forms. We feel very good about those investments in terms of the traction that we're getting from a customer standpoint. And we're certainly optimistic about our ability to generate good free cash flow while high returns on invested capital. Then we have some newer businesses. I say newer, they've been with us for several years, but at least they weren't since inception like beyond the digital initiatives like Web services. That's a business that we're investing in. We have great traction. The team has done a terrific job there. And we continue to improve that business, and it's growing very fast. And that's -- you're seeing capital requirements for that business. So that's a business that the team is operating very carefully. They're looking at best ways to improve return on invested capital over time, and we think that's a great big space to be investing in, and we think it's good for that customer set. And it's good for, we hope it to be good for customers over the long term.
James Friedland - Cowen and Company, LLC
And then just quickly on the investment in AWS it looks like the tech and content line has been accelerating and the q over q ramp was pretty meaningful again in Q2. Is that -- is the primary driver there AWS or is it a mix of things?
Thomas Szkutak
It's a mix of things but certainly AWS would be a big piece of that, along with our infrastructure to support our Retail business. When I say our Retail business, I mean everything but AWS. So again, think of it as the infrastructure cost to support those 2 businesses. There certainly are other investments we're making that are in that line item, but certainly, those are two big pieces.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Spencer Wang with Crédit Suisse.
Spencer Wang - Crédit Suisse AG
Tom, just a 2 part question on media and then a housekeeping question. On media, the revenue growth there reaccelerated pretty nicely from the last couple of quarters. Is there anything you would call out there, in terms of driving that reacceleration? Any sort of specific categories? And then the second part, I know it's still relatively early days for Prime Instant Video, but I was wondering if you could share with us some of the metrics you see and the impact on Prime membership. And then just last on the housekeeping question, how much were acquisitions to revenue growth in 2Q and in your 3Q guidance?
Thomas Szkutak
Sure. In terms of media, it was pretty broad across the board. Certainly, you're seeing great growth in our digital products, including Kindle that's represented there. The other thing to call out just from a sequential standpoint as you look at international specifically. We did see -- and this is reflected in the total growth rate for international, as well as the media growth rate. We did see an acceleration from Q1 to Q2 for our Japan business. We had talked about last time being soft given the events there, that our team there has done a terrific job serving customers, so we have seen the growth rates return more favorably from first quarter. They're not quite where they were last year but certainly they've -- we've seen an acceleration there, so that is also impacting our global media growth rates and it shows up in our International segment. In terms of Prime Instant Video, we're measuring, as you'd expect, a number of different things for that business. It's very early right now. There's not a lot I can share with you. What I can say though is we like what we've seen so far. We're continuing to invest there, and right now we're seeing customers love it, and it's early. So again, that's something that we'll continue to focus on. And then your third question in terms of acquisitions impact. For Q2, the most recent acquisitions for Quidsi and Lovefilm, that impact year-over-year for those two acquisitions, is a little over 200 basis points, approximately 220 basis points. We had a small amount in Q1. So if you're looking at it sequentially, assume it was about 30 basis points in Q1, and a little over 200 basis points in Q2. Again those are both year-over-year numbers impact for those acquisitions as Lovefilm was about half a quarter in Q1. In terms of bottom-line impact or CSOI and operating income for Q2, CSOI was about negative 19, for GAAP operating income, it was negative 27. That's for Q2. In terms of Q3, it's reflected in the guidance that we're giving today, and we're not breaking out those specific numbers.
Operator
And we'll go next to Mark Mahaney at Citi.
Mark Mahaney - Citigroup Inc
Tom, I want to ask about how you think through balancing margins and growth. I know you don't run the business per [ph] markets for free cash flow, but as you brought the margins down and investing aggressively to support what's this exhilarating 10-year high growth rates, I assume you're doing with a view not to just growth rate one quarter out or two quarters out, but for a full year out. Do you feel that you've got enough to grasp over the business such that when you see that growth rate slowing down, which it inevitably must, whenever that is in the year, that you can easily ramp-up margins? Do you really feel like you're at a point in the business model where that tradeoff is a very easy thing for you to manage?
Thomas Szkutak
Sure. The way you should think about it is first of all, the growth rates that you're seeing in Q2 really stem from investments that we've made over a long period of time. These aren't investments that we've made over the past few quarters. We have invested capacity over the last several quarters to help support that growth. And certainly that's one of the investments that's more recent. But again you should think about it as investments that we've made over a long period of time. For example, we've started investing in our Kindle business and AWS businesses several years ago now. And those have gotten great traction. We launched FBA several years ago. We launched Prime a few years back. We continue to launch new categories. We continue to add unique selections, so those of the things that have happened over an extended period of Time. We are also planting new seeds today. You see that Prime Instant Video as an example of that. Some of the -- a lot of the offerings that we have within AWS are examples of those. And again we have many examples of those across the business. So when we look at -- it was similar to the answer that I gave to Jim in the first question is again think about our business in a number of different pieces, but we have our Retail business that we've been offering in since inception. We continue to add capacity to support those. We continue to add selection and so those are the parts of the business that we feel very, very good about and the fact that we have to deploy more capital in terms of capacity we feel very good about. Again, our historical returns aren't predictive but we feel very good about it. And then we feel very good about the assets we have in our digital space as we convert from physical to digital, and then we talked about some of the newer investments as well that we feel very good that we're investing in today that we certainly hope and plan on getting good returns for shareholders. But our goal ultimately is, as you mentioned not to optimize for margins, but our goal is to maximize free cash flow and have high ROICs.
Operator
Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JP Morgan.
Douglas Anmuth - JP Morgan Chase & Co
I just wanted to ask two things. First, Tom it looks like you hired 5,300 people during the quarter. Can you give us some color on how they are spread out across the business? And then secondly, as you look at your margin outlook here for 3Q. Can you give us some color on the target roll-off and whether that's contemplated here in the outlook and how much of an impact that is?
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of the people and the quarter, keep in mind that we did acquire Quidsi at the start of the quarter, so that's included in the number. And so if you take Quidsi plus the operations in CS people that we added for the capacity that we've been talking about. The combination of those two make up the majority of those adds. Now we still had certainly adds across the business in a number of different areas. And particularly in some of the areas I mentioned, in some of the earlier questions. So again, the majority are of those 5,300, as well as actually the year-over-year increase, which is just under 15,000 is due to operations in CS and again, more recently, the acquisition of Quidsi. As for the margin, again, in terms of target, they've announced that they're going to be going to their new website in Q4 and we've had a very good relationship with them over the past several years. And we certainly wish them well with their new website. We were pleased to offer those services for them and again they've announced that they'll be switching to a new website in Q4.
Operator
We'll go next to Youssef Squali with Jefferies & Company.
Youssef Squali - Jefferies & Company, Inc.
Two quick questions please. First on the -- can you provide us an update on the distributed build out? How many distribution centers you have or you had by year-end -- I'm sorry, by quarter end. How many do you think you're going to have by year-end? I'm trying to figure out, where your capacity utilization today versus, say, 6 months ago. And second, can you talk about the strategy behind maybe the planned launch of the tablet products? Would you be able to looking to leverage in-store distribution channels for that product similar to what you've done with Kindle?
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of fulfillment centers. Last quarter, when we had our call, we had mentioned, or I had mentioned, that we had announced 9 fulfillment centers globally at that point. Right now, we've announced 15, and we are actually planning on a few more than that between now and the end of the year. So again if you look at where we're hiring for, we've announced, it's 15 today. And you should expect a few more. That compares to -- we added 13 last year. So it will be more than 15. 13 last year, it will be more than 15 this year...
Youssef Squali - Jefferies & Company, Inc.
And that's for a total of how many?
Thomas Szkutak
We haven't given the total for the year, but it's approximately in the low 50s adding 15 on top of that and then expect a few more. In terms of your other question, we have a long-standing practice of not talking about what we might or might not do. And so I can't help you with that question.
Operator
Our next question comes from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.
Scott Devitt - Morgan Stanley
Tom, net shipping costs were up 110 basis points year-over-year. I just wondered if you could talk about the impacts on that from oil prices versus Amazon Prime adoption and other customer experience initiatives that you've been working on.
Thomas Szkutak
If you look at really our net shipping costs over the last several quarters, what you've seen is we've been shipping and certainly more free and that includes Amazon Prime. We've also certainly incurred some higher shipping costs as you mentioned with fuel prices, but that's something that we've been doing with, really, since we started offering free shipping back in the early 2000s. So that's something that we're used to dealing with and something that we have dealt with. So again what you're seeing again over the last several quarters is certainly the customers like our free shipping programs, including some [ph] prime and that's reflected and that number. That's also one of the inputs along with a lot of the other things that we've been talking about that's helping fuel our growth.
Operator
We'll go next to Colin Sebastian with R W. Baird.
Colin Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated
I guess first off going back, Tom, to what you mentioned earlier in the call and the drivers of accelerating growth. I wonder if you could talk about the relative importance of these factors, in particular the low prices. And then secondly, just curious in the progress you're making in growing the China business. I think you've added more fulfillment capacity there, e-commerce in general appears to be accelerating in that market. If you could talk about your position and the relative importance of that.
Thomas Szkutak
Sure. In terms of lower prices, it's kind of hard to describe, to answer your question actually. We view it as an extremely important aspect of our business. It's -- there's a number of different things that are important to customers and certainly are making sure that we have great prices for our customers and great values for customers is extremely important. It's something that we've been working on for a number of years, making sure that we know when we have great prices relative to others. And so that's something that we've continued to work on to make it a great experience for customers and we do that globally across all of our categories. In terms of your question on China. We're very pleased with our business in China. It's growing very fast. It's -- we are in investment mode in that country and -- but we think it's a very interesting long-term opportunity and the team's doing a very nice job there and we continue to invest, and we're seeing nice growth there.

Our next question comes from Brian Pitz with UBS.
Brian Pitz - UBS Investment Bank
Tom, maybe you could give us an update on affiliates and the sales tax issue that's going on. Any updates there? As you cut ties with affiliates and [indiscernible] collect sales taxes, how should we be thinking about the impact on both revenue and margin?
Thomas Szkutak
I think in terms of the sales tax issue in total, the way you should think about it is we support a federal simplified approach as we have more than 10 years. We think in the U.S., that the federal solution's a great way to solve this. Also keep in mind as you think about our global business, we already collect sales tax or equivalent to more than half of our business or approximately half of our business across the world, and again we think the right solution to the U.S. is the federal solution. In terms of beyond that, we continue to serve our customers globally and we continue to work through the issue that you described.
Brian Pitz - UBS Investment Bank
Should we think about any additional reductions in the number of affiliates going forward or are we at a stable point right now?
Thomas Szkutak
I really can't comment on that. We're incredibly pleased to have our affiliates. We continue to work with them and there's not much more I can add to that.
Operator
We'll go next to Jeetil Patel with Deutsche Bank Securities.
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank AG
Two questions. In general digital content is becoming a growing industry theme as well as it seems like for Amazon. I guess curious as to whether you can comment on if there's a higher propensity for Prime customers to adopt digital content or is it broad-based among the customer base as a whole. And then second, a lot of the investments you're pushing through today, in terms of facilities, OpEx, et cetera. Can you talk about maybe what year are they typically geared for? How far out do you typically plan for in terms of investments today on products, new or existing? How far out do you typically think about from a planning standpoint that you're already absorbing in the model today?
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of digital content, it's -- we certainly have an offering right now. You asked the relationship between that and Prime. We certainly have a product with Prime is in video [ph] that we like. It's extremely early. We're learning, customers love it. What they're seeing so far we like what we're seeing so far in terms of some of the metrics but again it's very, very early. We do think that we are fortunate that we can offer such a service to customers, along with free shipping. We think that our good customers like both. They're both physical and digital customers. And so I'm not sure there's much more I can add to that. And then I'm sorry the second part of your question?
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank AG
Yes just a lot of the expense build and investments that you're making today in the form of OpEx and CapEx. I guess, how far out do you typically think through some of these plans, in terms of today and what you're assuming in the model on kind of -- on these last couple of quarters relative to when you start to see kind of the fruits of the labor, some of the product start to commercialize in the marketplace?
Thomas Szkutak
Well we look at our overall investments, certainly not on a long-term basis, we have -- when we launch or invest in something new, it's usually a number of years before we're cash flow positive. And then in many cases, several years before cash flow positive. And so we do take a long-term view. That being said, we monitor those investments very carefully. So, for example, and we do it on a discrete basis, on an area-by-area basis in terms of our investment. For example, in our Web Services business. That team has done a very nice job of growing that business innovating on behalf of customers and we're also trying to see how do we get -- ensure we get higher ROICs on that business. And so they've been working on that for a number of years. And so they look at it on a service-by-service basis. And what they're trying to do is become not only great -- have great services for customers but to be as efficient as possible in terms of from an investment standpoint. And so those are -- that just happens to be an example. That happens across the business. And we continue to monitor those investments.
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank AG
Can I ask it a different way? But the unit growth you're seeing this year of 50-plus percent. When do you think you put in kind of the investments or the plans in the P&L? Would you say it was back in 2008 or 2007, or would you say it was more recent than that?
Thomas Szkutak
Yes, yes, and yes. In terms of what enabled us to have the growth rate that we're experiencing today, I'll just take the retail part of our business for a second. There are many, many aspects of it, let me take just the retail part of it. We've continued to add great selection over a long period of time. And when I say great selection, unique selection. We've continued to get sharper and sharper arm pricing, understanding exactly where we are from a pricing standpoint. We've continued to launch new programs that get our product to customers quicker. We offered free shipping a number of years ago that made it more economical. We offer Prime to make it kind of quicker and more economical to get to customers, so it's a great service for customers. So all of these things have built upon themselves. We offer third-party offerings of [ph] 36% of total units. Several years ago now or a few years ago now, we'd launched Fulfilled by Amazon. It was a way to make that experience better for customers as well as sellers. So these things have built upon each other over a period of years. Now what you're seeing is there is a concentrated amount of investment that's going in, relative to capacity more recently. That really came out of -- you see different periods of growth that we've had where things have gotten softer, that we will absorb that investment and it becomes more productive. We saw that happen particularly in the U.S. when we had the downturn starting in late 2008. It kind of went through a portion certainly of 2009 even though our global growth was still in the high 20s. And that was a little bit softer in the U.S. for some of those periods. So we were able to add less fixed investment to support the capacity for that part of the business because of the growth. Now what you've seen is coming off of that through 2010, you saw very strong growth. We had 40% growth in 2010. You saw very strong growth in Q1. We had 36% growth on a local currency basis even with some of the softness in Japan. You've seen reacceleration in Q2 growth was 44% including a couple of hundred basis points of acquisition growth sequentially. So again it's, again these are building upon each other and some of the larger investments we've made to support capacity are more recent over the past 18 months now and that's continuing as you see from our Q3 guidance given the growth we're experiencing. So I'm trying to separate a little bit the growth to support the -- sorry, the capacity to support the growth but then we've made many smaller, some not so small investments over the past 10-years plus that have brought us to the growth rates on the customer experience that we have today.
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank AG
But strategic versus tactical spend?
Thomas Szkutak
Correct. So tactical, some of the investments that's required to support from a capacity standpoint in the infrastructure, as well as FCs this quarter Retail business, for example, I would consider that tactical or running the business-type adjustment. And those have been sizable. You can see step change in our capital and part of it's for that growth for that reason, part of it's for growth in FBA and part of it's for growth in Web services as well as a few other areas.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And we'll go next to Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.
Charles Munster - Piper Jaffray Companies
Back to the tax question. It's inevitable that 100% of your business will be taxed. And let's fast-forward to that point. What message would you have for investors on how to think about the impact that will have on your business? And then a follow-up to that is there are some rumors that as you pull the affiliates out of California, you may actually have some sort of sales tax liability. Can you put any of those rumors to rest?
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of where we'll end up I'm certainly not going to speculate where we'll end up over a period of time, in terms of sales tax. And again, I'm talking the broader issue, not any particular state. The way I think about it I talked about our approach in terms of the U.S. of having a federal our national solution and I think that's the right approach. But in terms of the business itself, one thing to keep in mind is that we do collect, as a reminder, sales tax or equivalent tax at approximately half of our business today. And so when you look at the growth rates that we're experiencing, again half or a little over half of our business we're collecting that today. So that part of the base that we have -- in the end, customers really want is they want a great experience, they want -- certainly they want low prices. They want the selection that they're looking for. They want fast delivery. They want it to be as convenient as possible. That's true among certainly our retail customers. So we continue to work on that experience. We continue to work on trying to make the seller experience even better, FBA, Fulfillment by Amazon is another example of that. That happens to also have a customer benefit the consumer not just the seller, but again sellers like it as well as consumers. We continue to make sure that our experience is good for our Web Services business. So we take that, the customers experience extremely seriously, it's something they’re working on very, very hard. And our digital offerings, Kindle, we have a great team who's innovating on behalf of customers across the business including our Kindle business. And so they're trying to make sure they continue to innovate. And so all of these things that I had mentioned are things that we think are important to customers and ultimately why customers will purchase from us or not. Those are the things that we're going to continue to work on because we can't predict what will happen in some of these other things. But we can predict that customers will still want low prices, they'll still want great selection, they'll still want convenience, they'll still want innovative products and services, on every half. So those are the things that we're going to be continuing to work on and have worked on since our inception.
Charles Munster - Piper Jaffray Companies
And then the affiliates is there any sales tax? Are you guys liable for any past sales tax in California?
Thomas Szkutak
I can't -- I'm not to comment on that.
Operator
Our last question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch
Two things. Talk about a lot of things, but not AWS. You still think that business -- I guess how's the trajectory? Do you still it still can be as big as retail? And any thoughts on what the margin profile of that business looks like relative to your core? So just thoughts on AWS in general. And then secondly, did you change the historical third-party unit forecast? I had a couple question on that. It looks like some of the historicals might have been higher than what you might have said in a couple prior quarters?
Thomas Szkutak
I'll answer the second one first. In terms of the unit growth and the third-party units, what we did this quarter, which is different than we have previously, we actually went with the paid unit growth as opposed to total units. So historically, we've been including -- there's been some amount of free units included in those numbers. And so for example, if you take a look at our current quarter, the number I mentioned was paid unit growth of 56%. That compared to again that's paid unit growth, that compared to 45% paid unit growth in Q1. The number that we reported in Q1 was actually 51% because that included free. So the comparable -- the 45% for Q1 and the 56% for Q2 are comparable. Again, those are just paid units. And then the third-party percentage of total units was 36% this quarter, up from 34% last year. And again those are paid units for the percentage of total units. And so we thought it would be an interesting, another interesting way of looking at it so we thought we'd provide it this quarter. In terms of the AWS business, it's certainly a very, very big space. Hard to say how big it will be for Amazon, but we're incredibly excited about that business. The team's done a terrific job and continue to innovate on behalf of customers. And we have just a great team of innovators and operators running that business, and we're very excited about it.
Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch
Can you say whether it's in investment mode or is it contributing at all to the bottom line at this point?
Thomas Szkutak
You should expect that we continue to invest in that business because of the high-growth nature of it. It's growing very fast. It is one of the reasons why you're seeing certainly a big contributor to our CapEx. It's also reflected in the tech and content line. And so again we're very excited about what we're seeing there. And the team is going to continue to stay heads down focused on their customer to drive that business.
John Felton

.
Good day, and welcome to the Amazon Quarterly Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Felton, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
John Felton
Hello and welcome to our Q1 2011 Financial Results Conference Call. Joining us today are Tom Szkutak, our CFO; and Rob Eldridge, our VP of Investor Relations. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 26, 2011, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K.
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.
During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. 
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2010. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas Szkutak
Thanks, John. I'll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12 months operating cash flow increased 9% to $3.03 billion. Trailing 12 months free cash flow decreased 18% to $1.9 billion. Return on invested capital of 24%, down from 45%. ROIC [return on invested capital] as TTM [trailing 12 months] free cash flow is divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends. 
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 466 million shares compared with 463 million shares. 
Worldwide revenue grew 38% to $9.86 billion or 36%, excluding the $144 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We're grateful to our customers who also continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers. 
Media revenue increased to $3.96 billion, up 15% or 13%, excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM [Electronics and other General Merchandise] revenue increased to $5.59 billion, up 59% or 57% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 57% of worldwide sales, up from 49%. Worldwide unit growth was 51%. 
Active customer accounts exceeded 137 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units were 33% of total units. 
Now, I'll discuss the operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. The cost of sales was $7.61 billion or 77.2% of revenue compared with 77.1%. Fulfillment, Marketing, Technology and Content and G&A combined was $1.78 billion or 18.1% of sales, up 234 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $831 million or 8.4% of revenue compared with 7.4%. Tech and Content was $580 million or 5.3% of revenue compared with 4.5%. Marketing was $320 million or 3.2% of revenue compared with 2.7%.
Now, I'll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments, our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line items. In the North America segment, revenue grew 45% to $5.47 billion. Media revenue grew 18% to $1.89 billion. EGM revenue grew 63% to $3.3 billion, representing 60% of North America revenues, up from 54%. North America segment operating income increased 6% to $290 million, a 5.3% operating margin.
In the International segment, revenue grew 31% to $4.39 billion. Adjusting for the $141 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 27%. We estimate that the international revenue growth rate was negatively impacted by approximately 500 basis points following the earthquake and subsequent events in Japan. 
Media revenue grew 13% to $2.07 billion or 9% excluding foreign exchange, and EGM revenue grew 54% to $2.29 billion or 49% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 52% of international revenues, up from 44%. 
International segment operating income decreased 25% to $175 million, a 4.0% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange, International segment operating income decreased 28%. 
CSOI [consolidated operating income] decreased 8% to $465 million or 4.7% of revenue, down 239 basis points year-to-year. Excluding the $7 million favorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased 9%. 
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 18% to $322 million or 3.3% of net sales. 
Our income tax expense was $89 million in Q1 or a 29% rate for the quarter. The tax provision for Q1 2011 includes income tax expense for approximately $8 million related to a discrete item in the quarter. GAAP net income was $201 million or $0.44 per diluted share compared with $299 million and $0.66 per diluted share. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $1.82 billion year-over-year to $6.88 billion. Inventory increased 59% to $2.89 billion and inventory turns were 11.6, down from 12.6 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 53% to $5.54 billion and accounts payable days increased to 66 from 59 in the prior year. 
Our Q1 2011 capital expenditures were $298 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, including investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services, capacity to support our fulfillment operations and investments in corporate office space. 
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date, and what we believe to date to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors including the high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. 
Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently. 
For Q2 2011, we expect net sales between $8.85 billion and $9.65 billion or growth between 35% and 47%. This guidance anticipates approximately 640 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange. 
GAAP operating income to be between $95 million and $245 million or between 65% decline and 9% decline. This includes approximately $180 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $275 million and $425 million or between a 32% decline and 5% growth. 
We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. 
Thanks. With that, John, let's move to questions.
John Felton
Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Spencer Wang with Crédit Suisse.
Spencer Wang - Crédit Suisse AG
Thanks for taking the question. 2 quick questions for Tom. Can you just maybe elaborate a little bit on your 2Q guidance and what you're thinking the impact from Japan could be and how you're thinking about when you incorporate that into your guidance? And then secondly, on shipping, the losses seem like they're growing. So I was wondering if you could just talk, Tom, about is that a function of more Prime usage, faster shipping or fuel cost perhaps impacting that line? Any more detail there would be great. Thanks.
Thomas Szkutak
Sure. In terms of your first question, what we saw for Japan, first of all to talk just briefly about Q1 and then I'll talk about Q2. Q1 in terms of impact, we think the impact is approximately 500 basis points on international revenue. If you take a look at international revenue growth, excluding foreign exchange, was up 27%. So about for the unfortunate events in Japan, it would have been approximately 32%. The impact on Q1 in terms of consolidated segment operating income was approximately $20 million. What we saw post the events, we certainly saw a pretty sizable slowdown for the few weeks ending the quarter. What we've seen since then so far quarter-to-date has been that certainly our growth rates have picked up, but they're not at the rates they were previous to the events. So again, we're seeing a positive growth there but not the growth rates we were seeing prior to that. And so what we believe for the quarter, along with all of our other assumptions are included in the guidance that we've given today. In terms of your second question related to shipping profit, what you're really seeing there is customers are coming out in great numbers with all of our adopting all of our free shipping programs including Amazon Prime. I think we're seeing great adoption there and that's really what's driving those numbers.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Jeetil Patel with Deutsche Bank.
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank AG
Great, thanks. A couple of questions. One, I guess, when you look at your -- it looks like the International business is really starting to kick in nicely and it seems like Amazon Prime has now had a chance to really mature and ramp up in a lot of your regions. I'm curious, are you seeing the same type of kind of returns that you saw in the U.S. market in terms of customer adoption, kind of purchase frequency in the international markets around Prime? And second, it seems like Kindle, you're kind of employing a similar strategies that you did with Prime which is stagger versus the U.S. market, and is it almost following the same path of kind of ramp and returns for the Kindle initiatives globally as you saw in the U.S. market?
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of your first question, Jeetil, related to Prime, we are seeing these similar dynamics. We are seeing customers love Prime in all geographies that we've offered it in. We are seeing great cross shopping that's happening, so customers really like the program. And obviously we have different offers depending upon geography, but we're very pleased with what we're seeing so far. In terms of Kindle, we've seen tremendous growth both from a device standpoint, as well as a unit standpoint in terms of digital books in the U.S. And where we are now offering it outside of the U.S., we're seeing the same -- even though it's early, we're seeing great adoption and growth there. So we're very, very happy to see the progress that we've made. One thing that we're doing obviously, you probably saw the launch related to -- the announcement related to Kindle special offers, we actually will start shipping tomorrow. The teams did a nice job of moving the dates up from several days from now to start shipping tomorrow, so very pleased to be able to offer that and excited about that offering.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Mark Mahaney with Citi.
Mark Mahaney - Citigroup Inc
Great, thanks. 2 quick questions. That 51% unit growth seems like a real outlier. You haven't had that kind of unit growth in the past. Is there something in there that's unusual, something in there that's one time-ish, something in there that tells -- would have you warn people to think that that's not a sustainable growth level? And then very recently, you have something of an outage in the Amazon Web Services field. Was that a demand problem which is not necessarily a bad thing or are there certain efficiencies that you needed to -- or inefficiencies that you needed to address that have been fixed? Thanks.
Thomas Szkutak
Probably the best way to answer the unit growth rate is if you take a look at what we saw in Q4 which is 43% growth rate, we saw a nice acceleration from 43% to 51% in Q1. What you're seeing there is we saw a great growth across the business. But the biggest thing you're seeing is that -- which primarily the consequence of growth of our digital business. That's what you're seeing in the growth rate, the acceleration in growth rate from Q4 to Q1. In terms of AWS, again, the team is working very deliberately on the way to identify and validate and fix the root causes associated with this incident, and that's what they're working on and I don't really have a lot to add to that at this time.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Youssef Squali with Jefferies.
Youssef Squali - Jefferies & Company, Inc.
Thank you very much. 2 quick questions. First, the midpoint of guidance for Q2 implies margins about 1.8%. So x SBC, where's the other 150 bps or so of additional spend going? How much of that is on recurring things like the 4,200 people or so you hired in the quarter versus kind of any one-time items? And second on the state tax issue, how big a concern is it to you, how big an advantage do you believe you've enjoyed so far from not paying taxes in those states? I guess in other words, would you have been able to grow at the rates you have been growing at if taxes were kind of levied across -- on your business across the U.S.?
Thomas Szkutak
Sure. In terms of your first question, we're not breaking out the individual line items, if you will, for operating expenses. But if you take a look at what we saw in Q1, you're seeing that we've added a lot of capacity to our CapEx and you'll also see the fulfillment capacities here on our CapEx and you'll also see it in the fulfillment line item. We added 13 fulfillment centers last year. If you take a look at the announcements that we've had to date, we're adding 9 fulfillment centers this year. Those are the ones that we've announced. With the growth rates we're seeing, you should expect -- if the order continues, you should expect to see more than that this year as well, more than the 9. So that's what you're seeing in the Q1. And you'll also see that reflected in the Q2 guidance as well. Same is true with Tech and Contents. We're adding a lot of capacity to support our growing business. Again, you've seen that reflected in the CapEx as well as the Q1 Tech and Content line and that's also reflected in the guidance as well. In terms of state taxes, one thing you keep in mind is we actually collect sales and value-added tax in approximately 50% of our revenue base, sort of a little over 50% of our revenue base today. And so the growth rates that you're seeing reflect the fact that we are collecting in more than half of our revenue base. So beyond that, there's not a lot I can add there.
Operator
We'll take our next question from James Mitchell with Goldman Sachs.
James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
Great. Thanks very much for taking the questions. If I look at the 74% growth in North America and other revenues, is that primarily due to Amazon Web Services? And then similarly, if I look at the step up in CapEx, would that also be primarily due to Amazon Web Services? And then kind of uniting the 2 questions together, historically Amazon has been very capital disciplined, how do you get confident that the capital you're putting into Amazon Web Services would generate returns over the time that you desire?
Thomas Szkutak
Sure. If you look at North America, other growth in the North America includes a number of items, including Web services. So it's a combination of all those items that we've talked about in the past. And so but certainly, Web services is a meaningful part of that. In terms of the CapEx question, what you see in CapEx is -- if you look at the growth, we had $1.1 billion of CapEx in the last 12 months. And if you look at the growth year-over-year of that CapEx, approximately 80% of that is due to pure capacity. And that's capacity in terms of fulfillment, that's capacity from an infrastructure standpoint to serve the retail business as well as AWS. And another 10% to 12% is associated with just the corporate office space and the remainder is a number of small items. So again, the vast majority, approximately 80%, is due to capacity, both infrastructure and our operation capacity. In terms of your question about how we think about AWS, we, like a lot of parts of our business, we look at that business very discretely and all the services very discretely. And we look at the ROIC potential of those businesses and the opportunity to work on trying to figure out the best way we get great returns for shareholders. And that's something that we've been doing since we launched the business, and obviously we have a lot more information to do that now than we did at launch. But again, it's something that we do continuously.

We'll take our next question from Jim Friedland with Cowen and Company.
James Friedland - Cowen and Company, LLC
Thanks. One of the other line items that was up year-over-year was marketing expense, 50 basis points. Is that a ramp or an incremental ramp in Kindle promotion? You guys also did something with a LivingSocial promotion in Q1. And also equity and affiliates was up a little bit. Was that due to the LivingSocial investments? Thanks.
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of marketing, the 2 primary paid marketing are still our associates channel and sponsored search. And so those are our 2 primary, but you're correct in terms of we are doing, as you've probably seen, some more broadscale advertising related to Kindle would be certainly incremental year-over-year and certainly impacting that number. In terms of the equity line, we do have a number of equity investments. And certainly, one of those is LivingSocial. And it's certainly impacting that number that you're seeing.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Ben Schachter with Macquarie.
Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Research
Can you describe how Amazon views its advertising business? In particular, how ramping up capabilities there could impact both Amazon properties and devices? And then separately, how you could participate in advertising opportunities on third-party sites? Thanks.
Thomas Szkutak
Yes, in terms of our advertising business, it's still very early. The team has done a fantastic job growing that business, and we'll have to wait and see what we do further with that business, but it's something that the team has done a great job. And it allows us and we think it allows us over time to have another way to have great low prices for customers.

And we'll go next to Colin Sebastian with Lazard Capital Markets.
Colin Sebastian - Lazard Capital Markets LLC
[Audio Gap] 
capacity build out. So when you mentioned that these top line growth rates that you may consider increasing the capital commitment to new capacity, is that something that's already reflected in the Q2 guidance range, or is that more likely a decision for the second half of the year? And then on the international operating income being down 25%, given that majority of Tech and Content spending is incurred in North America, if you could just clarify the drivers of that decline in income? Thank you.
Thomas Szkutak
You just -- I'm sorry, Colin, you're just breaking up in the first part of your question around capacity?
Colin Sebastian - Lazard Capital Markets LLC
Sure. So you mentioned the top line growth, if these rates continue, you might consider increasing the capital commitment to new capacity. And so I guess the question is, is that already somewhat reflected in your Q2 guidance or would that be a second half decision in terms of ramping up beyond the 9 fulfillment centers?
Thomas Szkutak
Here's where we are. We've had announcements of 9 fulfillment centers. 1 is operational today, 1 is coming up, will be operational in the coming days. We're actually doing receiving now. And then the remainder of those fulfillment centers will be throughout the year. And my comment was those are the ones that we've announced that certainly with the high growth that we're experiencing, you should expect that, should that continue, we would be adding additional fulfillment centers beyond it. What you are seeing in the Q2 guidance certainly reflects the fact that we will be adding capacity. And that's certainly 1 of the factors that went into the guidance that we've given.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.
Scott Devitt - Morgan Stanley
Thanks, just 1 question please. In categories that are facing structural change in distribution like the book industry which continues to be your largest segment, I was just wondering if you could talk about the effects that that is having today or may have on the margin profile of that business for you over time? Thanks.
Thomas Szkutak
Well, as we look at these new businesses, we're certainly looking at it from a free cash flow and a return on investment standpoint from a long term -- with a long-term perspective. We're incredibly excited in that specific one that you mentioned with Kindle because we see that customers are buying a lot more books. And so we're incredibly excited to be able to offer that to customers. We think the potential long term is -- we love the potential that it has long term and we continue to invest in that business.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Brian Pitz with UBS.
Brian Pitz - UBS Investment Bank
Thanks. A couple of quick ones. For Q2 revenue guidance, would you comment on whether Quidsi and Lovefilm are included? If so, any approximation of the impact? And then on content, can you give us any indications on the level of spending to secure digital content rights? Do you anticipate for Prime instant video? And then any commentary on whether or not that's driving Prime usage? Thanks.
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of Quidsi and Lovefilm, yes they're both in Q2. The impact is on revenue, approximately $140 million of revenue in Q2 which works out to be about 220 basis points of growth. Consolidated segment operating income is actually negative, approximately $15 million, and GAAP operating income is approximately negative $30 million in the quarter. So that's what's included in the Q2 guidance for Quidsi and Lovefilm combined. In terms of content, you have to stay tuned on that. We're not putting out those details. But the only thing I would say about it is we're very, very pleased with the adoption so far and it's very early and we will be adding some more content over time.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Sandeep Aggarwal with Caris & Company.
Sandeep Aggarwal - Caris & Company
Thanks for taking my question. I have 2 questions. One is, Tom, fulfillment and shipping expense have been among the core of Singles Amazon. And many multi-general dealers and pure-play commerce companies are getting into that space or getting better at least including eBay's possible acquisition of GSI Commerce. So how does Amazon continue to spend on its competitive modes around fulfillment and shipping experience? And second question is can you make a comment about the capacity utilization of the 13 fulfillment centers you set up last year?
Thomas Szkutak
Sure. In terms of the first part, we have a fantastic operations team that is continuing to look at ways to improve delivery speed, as well as improving our cost structure over time. And that's something you'd see if you look back over our history, it's something that they've worked on. And so they're always looking at ways to better serve customers and to get better. And so there's a number of ways that they do that. And it's a constant focus. In terms of the capacity, I don't think there's anything, any way to really help you because, again, the utilization will vary from week-to-week and quarter-to-quarter. But what we are seeing is, as you would expect with this great growth that we're experiencing, there is just more demand for capacity and that's both from a fulfillment capacity, that's both from our core retail business as well as fulfilled by Amazon.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Ken Sena with Evercore Partners.
Kenneth Sena - Evercore Partners Inc.
Thanks. So for the days payable to vendors, the increase was 11% to 66 days. How much more improvement do you think that you have there or is there something also driving that improvement that you can share? Thanks.
Thomas Szkutak
We're not giving -- we have been able to get good improvements over the past several years in AP days. We're not giving guidance on what that could look like, but we continue to work with our partners to improve our working capital cycle. And obviously, there's certainly a mix of categories that we have. They all have their own operating cycle. But again, we're very pleased with the operating cycle that we have and we'll continue to work with our partners over time.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer & Co.
Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.
Thanks. Can you just go into a little bit more detail on the DC centers? So of the 9 centers that you've announced, how many are international? And then are the costs higher to launch an international DC internationally than in the U.S.? So just a little more color on that. Thanks.
Thomas Szkutak
Sure. The -- of the 9, and we could probably have either Rob or John get back to you on the exact details, but approximately 4 those are in the U.S. or 5 in North America and the others are in international. So the fulfillment centers vary depending upon the level of automation and the locations they're in. I can't really give you a precise as 1 geography higher than another. It kind of depends on size and the level of automation.
Robert Eldridge
Hey Jason, it's Rob. I think 1 thing to add here is Tom's point. We're expanding fulfillment capacity worldwide. It's not just in a specific geography because the growth we're seeing is broad-based. The second point I just want to make is as we are building system of scales, fulfillment becomes more of a continuous investment project. It becomes less project to our end, just something that we need to undertake on a go-forward basis. And so you're certainly seeing that decision being reflected in our Q1 results and it's also reflected in our Q2 guidance.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.
Charles Munster - Piper Jaffray Companies
And I realized you guys talked about the impact of the LivingSocial promo, and as we look at the uptick in marketing expenses, it seems that you're spending a little bit more to get each incremental new customer. Is that true? And if so, what will be driving that?
Thomas Szkutak
Sorry, I didn't catch the first part of it, the LivingSocial piece.
Charles Munster - Piper Jaffray Companies
Well, I know you mentioned the LivingSocial, the impact of the LivingSocial promo on the marketing expenses. But backing that out, as you look at your marketing expenses, can you just talk a little bit about customer acquisition cost and how they've been trending?
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of -- I didn't mention anything about LivingSocial as it related to our marketing expense line. What I was referring to is if you look at our equity income line on our income statement, you can see an expense there and I've said that there was -- that was made up of a number of different investments that we have which includes LivingSocial, so that was the LivingSocial piece. In terms of marketing spend, we still -- the spend is very efficient. And again, what I mentioned earlier was that still the 2 primary pieces of our spend are our associates channel and also sponsored search, so those are our 2 primary. In terms of looking at it year-over-year, you're also seeing some of the broadscale spending we're doing specifically related to Kindle that's impacting that number as well.
Operator
And we'll go next to Heath Terry with Canaccord.
Heath Terry - Canaccord Genuity
Great, thank you. Seeing growth rates accelerate even slightly for the first time in the past 4 quarters, to what extent would you attribute that to the infrastructure buildout, improving product selection and availability? And maybe to get a little more granular, can you quantify for us the improvement in your product delivery time or availability that you've seen since the beginning of investment cycle?
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of quantifying, I'm not sure how much I can help you with that but there's no question that what we're seeing is customers responding to the increased selection across many categories, across many geographies. We also, certainly Prime is having an impact, as well as our other free shipping offers and so the adoption of both has been great. And so we're very pleased to that. Also, making sure that we have great low prices for customers is also having impact. So all of those things are having an impact on our growth rate that you see there.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Steve Weinstein with Pacific Crest.
Steve Weinstein - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc.
Great, thank you for taking my question. So it's already been noticed that the growth in units relative to growth in revenues is a pretty substantial difference and kind of a widening difference. I was wondering if you could explain when a customer becomes a digital customer and they started buying whether Kindle books or another digital product, how does their spending on Amazon change? Are they spending similar amounts with you and just buying more units or is the actual amount of spending with Amazon going up? Obviously the unit growth is a lot. Thanks.
Thomas Szkutak
I apologize, Steve, but there's not a lot I'll be able to help you with there in terms of specific numbers. But we are seeing customers who are digital customers still being very good, physical customers as well, so buying, doing a lot of cross shopping across our business. And so we're very excited about our digital offerings and it's certainly reflected in the unit growth that you mentioned. But also we're seeing very good growth amongst many physical categories across all of our geographies as well. So again, customers are responding to some of the things I already mentioned but they're certainly responding to the selection that we have for our digital offerings, as well as our physical product offerings. And that's reflected in the growth rates.
Operator
And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for 1 final question tonight. It does come from Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities.
Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
Thanks for taking my question, 2 questions actually. One, is there a point where increased digital offerings sales offset investments in selection and in stocks and we start to see that in the inventory turns number? And then secondly, a question on fulfillment and tax issues. How flexible is your fulfillment capacity in the U.S. if a state changes its mind or renegs on a prior agreement regarding tax collection? Thanks.
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of your first question, the reason why we're adding the physical capacity is it's growing very fast. So we are having the benefit of seeing both a very strong growth in our digital offerings, as well as a very strong growth in our physical offerings. So it's the combination of both things that are driving the overall growth of our business, as well as the fulfillment centers that you're seeing in the case of your question. In terms of the fulfillment centers, we have a lot of -- we have a wide range of fulfillment centers across a number of different states and geographies, and we continue -- our operation team does a great job in terms of figuring out where the best places are to invest and they'll continue to do that over time.
John Felton

Operator
Good day, and welcome to the Amazon Quarterly Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rob Eldridge. Please go ahead, sir.
Robert Eldridge
Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2010 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, January 27, 2011 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about the factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K.
As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.
During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2009. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas Szkutak
Thanks, Rob. I'll begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 6% to $3.5 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 14% to $2.52 billion. Return on invested capital was 34%, down from 66%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by the average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. 
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 465 million shares compared with 461 million shares. Worldwide revenue grew 36% to $12.95 billion or 37%, excluding the $139 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection of free shipping offers, including Amazon Prime. 
Media revenue increased to $5.23 billion, up 12% or 13%, excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM revenue increased to $7.39 billion, up 60% or 62%, excluding foreign exchange rates. Worldwide EGM increased to 57% of worldwide sales, up from 48%. Worldwide unit growth was 43%. Active customer accounts exceeded 130 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units were 30% of total units. Consolidated gross profit grew 33% to $2.63 billion and gross margin was 20.3%.
Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, Marketing, Technology and Content and G&A combined was $2.01 billion or a 15.5% of sales, up 101 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $1.06 billion or 8.2% of revenue compared with 7.7%. Tech and Content was $456 million or 3.5% of revenue compared with 3.1%. Marketing was $368 million or 2.8% of revenue, consistent with prior year. 
Now we'll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense line items. In the North America segment, revenue grew 45% to $7.21 billion. Media revenue grew 13% to $2.37 billion. EGM revenue grew 71% to $4.56 billion, representing 63% of North America revenues, up from 54%. North America segment operating income increased 6% to $295 million, a 4.1% operating margin.
In the International segment, revenue grew 26% to $5.74 billion. Revenue growth was 29%, adjusting for the $143 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact during the quarter. Media revenue grew 11% to $2.87 billion or 13% excluding FX. And EGM revenue grew 46% to $2.83 billion or 50%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 49% of international revenues, up from 43%.  International segment operating income increased 3% to $327 million, a 5.7% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, International segment operating income increased 16%. 
CSOI grew 4% to $622 million, or 4.8% of revenue, down 146 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $18 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI grew 7%. Unlike CSOI, GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income was relatively flat at $474 million or 3.7% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $84 million in Q4 or 17% rate for the quarter. GAAP net income was $416 million or $0.91 per diluted share compared with $384 million and $0.85 per diluted share.
Now I'll discuss full year results. Revenue grew 40% to $34.2 billion. North America revenue grew 45% to $18.71 billion, and International grew 33% to $15.5 billion, 34% growth excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. Consolidated segment operating income or CSOI grew 23% to $1.94 billion or 25%, excluding $28 million of unfavorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange, and operating margin decreased 75 basis points to 5.7%. GAAP operating income grew 25% to $1.41 billion or 4.1% of net sales. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $2.4 billion year-over-year to $8.76 billion. Inventory increased 48% to $3.2 billion, and inventory turns were 11.4, down from 12.2 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved the in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. 
Accounts payable increased 44% to $8.05 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 72 from 68 in the prior year. Our Q4 2010 capital expenditures were $328 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, including investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services, capacity to support our fulfillment operations and investments in corporate office space. 
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe to date to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
As we've described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling inter-company balances in foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q1 2011, we expect net sales of between $9.1 billion and $9.9 billion, a growth of between 28% to 39%. This guidance anticipates approximately 140 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income to be between $260 million and $385 million or between 34% decline and 2% decline. This includes approximately $140 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets, but we anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expenses to be between $400 million to $525 million or between 21% decline and 4% growth. 
We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. 
And with that, Rob, let's move to questions.
Robert Eldridge
Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on with the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Mark Mahaney with Citi.
Mark Mahaney - Citigroup Inc
First, on the gross margin trends, down a little bit year-over-year. Would that have been impacted by the strong sale of Kindle devices in the fourth quarter? And second, could you just talk broadly about the Subscribe and Save offering that you have and to what extent you've seen cross selling into more consumer-staple items amongst your customer base?
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of gross margins. You are seeing some volatility to look at the individual quarters from 2010. You saw that we were down a bit in Q1, up the next two quarters slightly and then down a little bit in Q4, about approximately 45 basis points. And we haven't been talking much more on the gross margins because we don't think it's that meaningful, and that's what we're trying to point people to the bottom again. And the reason we're doing that is because of the mix of business. And so what you're seeing there in gross margins in Q4 is we have a very broad mix of businesses and geographies that are going into that number. And again, you're seeing some volatility in the individual quarters. But again, we're very pleased with what we saw in Q4 in terms of growth and overall performance of the business. And it reflects a very heavy investment load to support the growth that we expect. In terms of the Subscribe and Save, could you repeat the question again?
Mark Mahaney - Citigroup Inc
What kind of impact had you seen or what kind of adoption rate have you seen for that and just broadly, your penetration, what kind of consumer staple spending amongst the Amazon customer base?
Thomas Szkutak
Sure. Subscribe and Save is going very well. It's something that certainly customers like a lot. And we're getting that benefit in the consumer portion of the consumer category today, again, it's something that we're excited about and customers are excited about, so we're happy to offer it to them.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from James Mitchell with Goldman Sachs.
James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
Just two questions about revenue growth, and I don't want to sound critical of revenue growth because obviously, growth rate's very high. But just picking into two components. First of all, is there any big obvious reason why international growth decelerated while the domestic growth accelerated? And then secondly, in the Media business, if e-book sales are now bigger than paperback sales and paperback sales continue to grow, is there a big obvious reason why total media sales is growing at 13% rather than a slightly faster number? I assume that the agency accounting for e-books is part of that, perhaps?
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of overall growth, we are very pleased with what we saw, just kind of frame up that discussion a bit. We saw 40% growth year-over-year total year 2010, which is the best growth rate we've seen since 2000. We saw Q4 growth rate overall of 37% on local-currency basis, which matches our best growth rate for any Q4 we've had on a local-currency basis since 2000. And then unit growth was 43%, which certainly going back several years, we haven't seen any quarter that's had that growth. So we're seeing very strong growth across many categories, across many geographies. In terms of the international growth specifically, if you look back to last year, we did have very strong media growth in international in Q4. You'll see that it's up 26% on a local-currency basis, which is one of the strongest quarters we've had, and we're overlapping that. There were some new releases that were in Q4 last year. Most notably, the Windows 7 release one, Dan Brown's book in Germany is other, those are a few examples, but there are a few releases that were in there. The other piece to that we haven't -- certainly difficult to quantify but there was certainly some impact from some of the weather that we saw in Europe during the month of December. But again, we're very pleased with the growth that we saw in Q4 in total, including international, and we're happy with what we see there. In terms of some of your questions surrounding media. Again, we are seeing good growth there. As you mentioned, we're seeing, so far, quarter date this quarter, we saw that Kindle books exceeded paperbacks, which is very exciting and while having paperbacks continue to grow, year-over-year. So again, we're seeing very strong growth there. So again, we're pleased with the growth we're seeing across the business.
James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
Is there a track on the media growth from the accounting of the agency e-books?
Thomas Szkutak
Could you say that again?
James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
Is the fact that some of the e-books are being sold on an agency rather than on a consignment basis, this year is that acting as a drag on growth temporarily, in terms of your reported revenue?
Thomas Szkutak
Certainly, the agency piece is included in the numbers that we reported today. But in terms of the impact, we're not breaking that out. But again, we're very excited with the growth that we're seeing within books, e-books specifically and physical books are going well as well.
Operator
We will take our next question from Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse.
Spencer Wang - Crédit Suisse AG
First, Tom, for the first quarter guidance, it would seem like your operating income guidance implies that you are still reinvesting in the business. Could you just give us a little bit more color on is it still fulfillment centers? Is it tech and content, all of the above? And secondly, with the Lovefilm's acquisition, can you just walk us through the rationale and how you'll integrate that with perhaps your other video-on-demand businesses?
Thomas Szkutak
Sure. In terms of the guidance, let me just put that in context. And probably the best way to do it is just again a reminder on 2010. The fact that we had very strong growth, the best growth we've seen in 10 years. Fourth quarter matched the best, on a local-currency basis growth, matched the best fourth quarter we've had since 2000. And again, very strong unit growth and the best we've seen. With all that growth, we had to add a lot of capacity, most of which was in the second half of last year. We added fulfillment capacities for the corner retail business. We added fulfillment capacities to support our growing fulfilled by Amazon business was part of our seller business. We added a lot of infrastructure capacity to support our fast-growing AWS business, as well as our retail business. So those reflected, when you look at our Q4 results and our 2010 results, those are reflected in the CapEx numbers that you're seeing, and those are reflected in the fulfillment as well as the tech and content lines when you look at our operating expense line items. And so because it was largely back half of the year loaded, you're seeing more of that in Q1. So those are reflected in the growth rate. Now the question will be we're not giving guidance beyond Q1, but what will this mean going forward? And so one of the things that we're doing is certainly, when you look at our Q1 guidance, you look at our topline guidance, we're cautiously optimistic about Q1, in a very strong growth. And we'll have to see how much we invest throughout the year in 2011 based on that. But again, I'm very, very happy with the capital we're able to deploy. You should keep in mind that with the sheer amount of capacity that we added in 2010, it doesn't become, it's not fully utilized day 1 and we don't get the optimum productivity on day 1. So what that means is we get productivity on those operations. We get returns on those assets that we deploy over a period of time. But if you look at our history, we've gotten very good returns on that capital. And so to me, I'm very pleased to put that capital in place. And if we have to add more in 2011, it will be a high-quality problem.
Spencer Wang - Crédit Suisse AG
And on Lovefilms?
Thomas Szkutak
Lovefilm, we think it's just a very exciting opportunity. We've had a close association with that business for some time. We're very pleased to be able to offer customers the media space within Europe they're offering. So again we're very excited about it, and you have to stay tuned on that one.

We will take our next question from Doug Anmuth with Barclays Capital.
Douglas Anmuth - Barclays Capital
First, I just wanted to ask in terms of the revenue growth that you're expecting for 1Q, can you give us a sense of how much you're anticipating from acquisitions? And then secondly, if you could comment just on your thinking around the living social investment and also what you may have learned from the recent daily offer which you ran within the last week or so?
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of the guidance for Q1, specifically in terms of acquisitions, the Lovefilm or Quidsi, which haven't closed yet are not reflected in guidance. So those are not in our Q1 numbers. In terms of living social, we're very pleased with the investment that we've made there. In terms of any commentary on the recent deal, the recent one-day offer that they had. We're very excited that they offered Amazon gift certificates, and we think it's great for customers and we're happy they've enabled that.
Operator
We will take our next question from Brian Pitz with UBS.
Brian Pitz - UBS Investment Bank
First, an update on AWS. It looks like other revenue in North America slowed pretty significantly and I realized that's a decent part of Other. Any commentary on what was the main driver of that slower growth? And second, on Grocery, can you give us a little more insight on your initiatives there and the potential cost impact from expanding this category?
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of AWS, we're extremely pleased with how AWS is going. It's growing at a very fast rate. We're investing in that business to support that growth rate. You're correct, in terms of seeing the North America Other growth rate drop from 52% to 45% year-over-year from Q3 to Q4. Keep in mind that there's a number of things in there including AWS that tend to be a little lumpy. But we did see actually an acceleration of growth in AWS from Q3 to Q4. So built into that number, it actually accelerated. So again we're very pleased with the growth that we're seeing there. In terms of Grocery, we have two things that you probably could be referring to. One is our Drygoods business, which is within our Consumer business that we're very pleased with that we have on Amazon.com, as well as some other sites. In addition to that, we have a local test here in Seattle called Amazon Fresh. Again, that is a test that we've been conducting. We're pleased with how the test is going. But again, it's a test and we'll continue to see how that goes and see if we invest further on that test. Again, we do a number of tests in different parts of our business and that happens to be one of them. We have a great team that's working on it, but you'll have to stay tuned to see if we do more there.

We will take our next question from Youssef Squali with Jefferies.
Youssef Squali - Jefferies & Company, Inc.
Tom, can you tell us how many distribution centers you actually had at the end of 2010? I know you're not going to guide to 2011. But since you're guiding to Q1, are you planning opening on any distribution centers, and what's your CapEx for Q1?
Thomas Szkutak
We had approximately 52 at the end of 2010. We added 13 last year. We will add more fulfillment centers this year. We haven't said, we weren't saying how many yet because again we're trying to determine what the growth rate will be. And based on what we've seen in Q1, we're certainly cautiously optimistic which is reflected in the growth rate you see for guidance for Q1. So we'll have to wait and see, and we'll be back with you as we go throughout the year. But just to be clear, again, I've mentioned in one of the other questions that I think would be a very high-quality problem. And the reason why I say that is what our teams are doing around the world right now, which is the same thing we've been doing for the last 15 or 16 years in working with our various fulfillment centers is even though we're not fully utilized in some of these new assets that we deployed in 2010 or our productivity is not optimum, that team will work to utilize those assets. As we continue to grow, we'll get better and better productivity as we go, just like we have in our other fulfillment centers around the world that we've had experience with. So we're very excited about that. And so when you think about the fulfillment centers, even though they can be a little bit dilutive in the short term by looking at our fulfillment expense, the reason why I'm very excited about is that you can just look at our return on invested capital. If you take our return on invested capital at the end of 2010, we had approximately $7.4 billion of invested capital. That's a 5-point average over the last five quarters. If you take out cash and marketable securities over the same period, that's about $6.5 billion. So we have about $900 million of invested capital. And even with our heavier spend in CapEx last year, we generated $2.5 billion of cash flow. So we have an excess of 250% of return on our invested capital x cash and marketable securities. And so again, that's a full business. It includes a lot of things over a period of time. But if you think about that capacity where we need it because of growth, we're certainly very happy. We do it judiciously and make sure we do it appropriately. But very happy to deploy that capital to get great returns for shareholders over time. And again, the returns that we've gotten are certainly historical, not predictive. But again, we're very happy to deploy that capital, and I feel very good about it.
Youssef Squali - Jefferies & Company, Inc.
Are you quantifying CapEx for Q1?
Thomas Szkutak
No, we haven't quantified the CapEx for Q1, I apologize. But again, we will do what we need to do to support the growth in both the infrastructure and fulfillment.
Operator
We will take our next question from Colin Sebastian with Lazard Capital Markets.
Colin Sebastian - Lazard Capital Markets LLC
One follow up on the gross margins. I think historically, Amazon's pricing philosophy has been to be a price follower. And I guess I'm curious if perhaps you're loosening that strategy up a bit, maybe to be a price leader in more categories?
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of pricing, we've had a number of different strategies over the course of our history. But certainly, our objective is to have great values for customers over all of our selection, over all of our geographies, and that hasn't changed. And so we're very excited to offer customers that. It's a reason, certainly one of the drivers for the growth that we've been able to have over our history. And so one of the things that we do, do is when we enter a new category and add selection within that category, we price it day 1 as competitively as we can. So in other words, we price it competitively day 1 based on the intelligence we have. And sometimes that means it's a very low gross margin because we're just entering those particular categories with those particular items. And that's something we've been consistently doing for a number of years, and we like that strategy.
Operator
We will take our next question from Ben Schachter with Macquarie.
Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Research
There's a lot of interest in how the Kindle ecosystem actually impacts the margin. I was wondering if you could just help us understand, the one question would be all-in Kindle hardware and software, the whole thing together, how is that impacting gross margin? And then overall, how should we think about how the agency model and the e-books how that's going to impact margin? And then just one quick one. There's been some speculation about the potential to bundle services with Amazon Prime. I was wondering if you could tell us how you think about that and if that's something that may be interesting in the future?
Thomas Szkutak
First off, we have a long-standing practice of not breaking out any individual products or categories. But what I can say about Kindle is it's growing very fast. We're extremely pleased with what we're seeing. We sold millions of devices in Q4. The content business, the content part of it is growing very fast as evidenced by some of the comments we put in the earnings release. .So far quarter-to-date this quarter again Q1, we have Kindle content, Kindle book sales growing at a faster rate than paperbacks, which is really exciting. And so that business is going very well. And with the opportunity that we see there, we're continuing to invest in that business. We think it's a very good business for us, and we're excited about the long-term opportunity there.
Operator
We will take our next question from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch
Maybe you could explain why Kindle is a better business for Amazon? And then secondly, you talked about gross margin maybe not being the best way to measure the company, maybe you could explain why operating margin is better? And do you have individual management targets as far as compensation or as a company as a whole and where you want to get to for operating margins?
Thomas Szkutak
I'm not sure I understood the first part of your question related to Kindle.
Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch
I guess I'm asking why Kindle is a better business than your traditional book-selling media business?
Thomas Szkutak
Well, we happen to like both. Even though we're extremely excited about our Kindle business, our physical book business continues to grow as well. And so we're very excited about both parts of our business. And again we think, when I was mentioning Kindle, we just think it's a great opportunity for us. It has great tracks right now. Customers like it. We're able to offer so many titles right now on less than 60 seconds right to for a customer to be able to read. And one of the things you can't do with a physical book is you can't, from a service perspective with our model, it's very difficult to get it to a customer now. And with Kindle, we can do that in less than 60 seconds. You can carry around your library with you very lightly, and so we think it's just great for customers, and we're seeing that the growth, both in terms of devices and content, is just fantastic. And so we're continuing to invest and continue to improve that experience for customers. In terms of gross margins versus operating margins, we actually don't focus a lot on individual percentages, whether it be gross margins or operating margins. We're focused on ultimately over the long term on free cash flow, free cash flow per share. We like to look at our return on invested capital. I mentioned earlier what our return on invested capital is today. That includes appropriately so the cash and marketable securities that we have in that balance. But certainly, if you were to deploy that cash and return that to shareholders over time, you can see the underlying returns on invested capital x cash are very high and in excess of 250% right now. And so we think it's a very efficient capital business, and we think that we certainly like the model that we have and the opportunity that it brings to our shareholders over the long term.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Jeetil Patel with Deutsche Bank Securities.
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank AG
First of all, I guess when you look at the Kindle side of the equation, do you believe that the proliferation of Kindle apps across devices, not just your own device, is helping to increase the overall consumption of books across the industry or Amazon? And then second, I guess as it relates to international, where do you stand in terms of Pan-European fulfillment capabilities, say shipping from Germany into the Netherlands into Scandinavia, et cetera?
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of Kindle apps, we think it's good for customers that they can read their Kindle books on their Kindle, as well as many other devices. And so that's what you see today. We have these apps so that it's easy for customers to be able to do that. Customers like that feature, and you should expect us to continue to expand that over time. So how much is it contributing to overall growth? It's hard to say. But again, customers are responding to the vast selection that we have, the great prices we have for Kindle content, the ease of which they can carry it around with them with the great convenience on the device, the Kindle device itself, so we're very excited about it. In terms of fulfillment. We continue to work with our fulfillment to make it as seamless as possible for customers. That's really what it's all about in each of the geographies we're in, and we'll continue to do so. So wherever we can make that service within Europe, better for customers, we will. It will come from whatever fulfillment center makes sense.
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank AG
You've had tremendous growth in customers over the past year, about 24 million or so. Do you think that your lifetime kind of value of the customer equation has changed? Particularly as you looked at you have initiatives like Kindle and Prime. Do you think that the economics have changed, obviously, for the better that you're acquiring more aggressively? Is that how we should think about some of these newer initiatives that you've had over the last several years that have been certainly been pretty impactful?
Thomas Szkutak
No, I think, not commenting on the lifetime value of customers. But we continue to offer new things for customers to make the experience better for customers. So we're adding new selection to make that better for customers. We launched Prime a number of years ago which continues to grow because we want to make sure that we give great service to customers. Many of our digital initiatives are around how do we make sure we get customers, not only creating great price and great selection but they get to have their content immediately. And so those are the things -- that is always -- with us, we start with the customer first. That's where our focus is. We found that by aligning with the customer, it's been great for customers as well as great for shareholders over time. So that's the focus that we've had and the driver behind the initiatives over the past several years.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Jim Friedland with Cowen and Company.
James Friedland - Cowen and Company, LLC
Question on marketing.  If we look at marketing as a percentage of revenues this year, it was up and I believe you said one of the main reasons was the inclusion of Zappos. And as we think about your marketing spend in 2011, is that the sort of seasonality and pattern that we should look for or is anything changing in your approach to marketing?
Thomas Szkutak
Well, certainly we added, continued to support the Zappos marketing spend in 2010. That was a part of it. We're always looking for ways to reach customers through our marketing spend. We also did, you'd probably noticed a fair amount of Kindle ads during 2010, primarily starting for the most part heavier after Q1 of last year, which we saw a great response to. So again those are some of the dynamics to think about.
Operator
We will take our next question from Steve Weinstein with Pacific Quest.
Steve Weinstein - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc.
Question on Prime membership. Now that it's been active in the U.S. for quite a long time now, are you still seeing new members adopting Prime at a rapid rate? And I'm wondering when you think that may plateau as far as penetration in terms of it, the existing customer base?
Thomas Szkutak
We are seeing adoption of Prime in our geographies. It continued to grow nicely, and customers like Prime. They like that service element of Prime. We have different offerings, depending on the geography that we're offering it in. In the U.S., you can get express two-day shipping for free, you get one day and also some other offers, in terms of weekend offers as well. So again, there's some interesting service element to that. And customers are responding very well to it, both existing Prime members as well as new Prime members. So it's going very well.
Steve Weinstein - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc.
I guess I'm asking, I mean do you think you're reaching any sort of ceiling, in terms of how many U.S....
Thomas Szkutak
No. And again, hard to tell when that would happen, but that's certainly not what we're experiencing.
Operator
We will take our next question from Heath Terry with Canaccord.
Heath Terry - Canaccord Genuity
I was wondering if you could give us a sense, is there a way to quantify the amount of time necessary for the recently opened distribution facilities to get to the same utilization level that you're seeing in the rest of the business? And what kind of impact do you think that has on operating margins to the extent that you can kind of quantify that for us? And in light of the investments in this quarter, I guess it's worth at least asking if you still feel like 10% is the right long-term operating margin to be thinking about for the whole business?
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of when the fulfillment centers will reach their optimum utilization and productivity, we're still getting productivity on existing fulfillment centers that we've had for quite some time. So it'll be something that will evolve over a longer period of time. But again, if you look at the returns that we've gotten on the previous fulfillment centers that we've launched, they have been great uses of capital. So we're very happy about that. And in terms of your question on double-digit operating margins, we've said for a long time and nothing's changed in that regard. We think that certainly double-digit operating margins are possible. If it means that we have some high single-digit operating margin that maximizes free cash flow, we're certainly okay with that and have room to go there. But we're certainly focused on how do we get the best free cash flow, free cash flow per share while getting great efficiency on our invested capital. And so nothing's changed there.
Operator
We will take our last question from Sandy Aggarwal with Caris & Company.
Sandeep Aggarwal - Caris & Company
Tom, in our assessment, there are many international markets which have grown healthier than the growth you achieved in Q4? And I know it is a blended growth number and probably some FX dynamics. But are you seeing any basically local e-commerce players getting stronger in international market? And secondly, any early signs of traction for the launch of the site in Italy?
Thomas Szkutak
Again, we grew 29% on a local-currency basis for international, 26% on a dollar basis, a challenging compare from fourth quarter of 2009 where we certainly, from a media perspective, had one of our best growth rates that we've had in any quarter previously. EGM grew at 50% on a local-currency basis, so very strong growth. And again, we have a long-standing practice. We're not talking about other companies, but we're very pleased with what our international team is doing. We have a great opportunity there for further growth. In terms of Italy, very early, but pleased with what we're seeing so far, and I like the opportunity there.

Good day, and welcome to the Amazon Quarterly Conference Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Rob Eldridge, please go ahead, Sir.
Robert Eldridge
Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2010 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Thomas Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect the management's views as of today, October 21, 2010 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K.
As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.
During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2009. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas Szkutak
Thanks Rob. I'll begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 16% to $2.62 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 5% to $1.83 billion. Return on invested capital was 28%, down from 50%. ROIC is TTM-free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends.
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 465 million shares compared with 451 million shares. Worldwide revenue grew 39% to $7.56 billion or 40%, excluding the $83 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchanges rates. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, fast selection and free shipping offers, including Amazon Prime.
Media revenue increased to $3.35 billion, up 14% or 15% excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM revenue increased to $3.97 billion, up 68% or 71% excluding foreign exchange rates. Worldwide EGM increased to 53% of worldwide sales, up from 43%. Worldwide unit growth was 41%. Active customer accounts were approximately 121 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units were 34% of total units.
Consolidated gross profit grew 39% to $1.77 billion, and gross margin was 23.5%.
Now, I'll discuss our operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content in G&A combined was $1.37 billion or 18.2% of sales, up 120 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $657 million or 8.7% of revenue, compared with 8.2%.
Tech and content was $386 million or 5.1% of revenue, compared with 4.9%. Marketing was $234 million or 3.1% of revenue, up from 2.6% in the prior year.
Now, I'll talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item.
In the North America segment, revenue grew 45% to $4.13 billion. Media revenue grew 13% to $1.59 billion. EGM revenue grew 80% to $2.33 billion representing 56% of North America revenues, up from 45%. North America segment operating income increased 19% to $186 million, up 4.5% operating margin.
In the international segment, revenue grew 32% to $3.43 billion. Revenue growth was 35%, adjusting for the $86 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact during the quarter. Media revenue grew 16% to $1.76 billion or 18% excluding FX. And EGM revenue grew 54% to $1.64 billion or 60% excluding FX. EGM now represents 48% of international revenues, up from 41%.
International segment operating income increased to 11% to $215 million, a 6.2% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact for foreign exchange, international segment operating income increased 20%.
CSOI grew 15% to $401 million or 5.3% of revenue down a 112 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $15 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI grew 19%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 7% to $268 million or 3.5% of net sales.
Our income tax expense was $79 million in Q3 or a 27% rate for the quarter. GAAP net income was $231 million or $0.51 per diluted share compared with $199 million and $0.45 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $1.88 billion year-over-year to $5.88 billion. Inventory increased 56% to $2.52 billion and inventory turns were 11.8 down from 12.1 turns a year ago, as we extended selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories.
Accounts payable increased 38%, $4.61 billion and accounts payable days increased to 73 from 72 in the prior year. Our Q3 2010 capital expenditures were $315 million. The increase in capital expenditure reflects additional investments and support of continued business growth, including investment in technology infrastructure including Amazon Web Services, capacity to support our Fulfillment operations and investments in corporate office space. We expect this trend to continue throughout 2010.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into the guidance of the order trends that we seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and net foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.
For Q4, we expect net sales of between $12 and $13.3 billion a growth between 26% and 48%. This guidance anticipates approximately 70 basis point of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be between $360 and $560 million between 24% decline and 18% growth. This includes approximately $140 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.
We anticipate consolidated segment-operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $500 million and $700 million or between 16% decline and 17% growth.
We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
Thanks. And with that, Rob, let's move to questions.
Robert Eldridge
Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you remind our listeners how to initiate a question, please?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley, please go ahead.
Scott Devitt – Morgan Stanley
One question please, the growth rates for the business on our segment sales basis described between North America and in international is about 10 percentage points and it’s begun to work in favor of North America recently. I was just wondering if you could comment on the respective unit sales domestically versus internationally, and it’s described as similar? Thanks.
Thomas Szkutak
Yeah, I can’t – we are not breaking out the unit growth by segment, but we are seeing, very strong unit growth globally, it’s up 41% which is certainly better than we’ve seen recently. Also keep in mind when you look at the difference between North America revenue growth and international, we do have the impact of Zappos included in the North American numbers this year, which we wouldn’t have that in last year as well.
Scott Devitt – Morgan Stanley
Thanks.
Operator
And for our next question from Mark Mahaney with Citi, please go ahead.
Mark Mahaney – Citi
Thanks. I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the Q4 guidance, particularly on the CSOI line. Typically, you are able to generate in flattish margins sequentially that’s not which you are guiding to at the midpoint, is that because some of the investments you wanted to rollout in the September quarter are being delayed? Are there new levels of investments that you are looking for in the December quarter? Are you rolling out more distribution centers there? Anymore color on why the sequential decline in margins is a little bit out of the norm? Thanks.
Thomas Szkutak
Thanks Mark. Yes, we have launched or opened about 10 performance centers right now. We have a couple more that are coming over the coming few weeks to get ready for our peak season. So certainly that’s part of which we are seeing in Q4, obviously we have been incurring some cost on those three as well prior to Q4, but again you will see that ramping up.
The other thing too is we will continue to add capacity for infrastructure as well during Q4 and that’s both for our retail business as well as our very fast growing AWS business, so those are impacting the guidance which you see there.
Mark Mahaney – Citi
Thanks Tom.
Operator
Our next question comes from James Mitchell with Goldman Sachs, please go ahead.
James Mitchell – Goldman Sachs
Great, thank you for taking the question. You are offering a range of free pass by to Amazon Prime such as Amazon Prime for students and Amazon Prime for mothers, how do you persuade the consumers to receive Prime for free-to-value and make full use of the service by purchasing more products as those consumers who are paying for Prime typically do?
Thomas Szkutak
Well, again it’s a free offer, so that’s something that we think is compelling and it follows really what we’ve done for Prime in general. We’ve offered free trials for Prime members going back to few years now, and the reason why we are doing that, again the free trials I’m talking about, not just in the Mom right now.
The reason why we were doing that was we wanted to make sure that customers could see the experience real time and we find that when customers see it real time, they become members and we’ve seen that consistently and so the other two programs that you mentioned, the Student and Mom, still very early and we are happy with what we see but we are still very early.
James Mitchell – Goldman Sachs
Thank you.
Operator
Your next question is from Brian Pitz with UBS.
Brian Pitz – UBS
Thanks. What percent of the increase in fulfillment was due to the shift of third-party fulfillment from COGS that you highlighted the last quarter? And then more a longer term question, can you talk about your strategy in online video distribution, does it make sense for be it a rollout of subscription streaming video product given competitors’ success? Thanks.
Thomas Szkutak
We are not breaking out the change that you mentioned, but you can – the way you should think about it is would be a similar amount last year in Q3, as it was in Q2 in terms of basis points. In terms of the second, can you repeat the second part of your question on..?
Brian Pitz – UBS
Just in terms of your online video distribution, obviously you have VOD with over 65,000 titles, but migrating to a subscription streaming product, can you just give us a little thought on that given the success of some of your competitors?
Thomas Szkutak
Sure, I wouldn’t speculate what we would do or not do in the future there, but now it’s certainly and there room for a lot of innovation and we’ve got a great team in place that’s working on that and we are going to try to do what’s best for customers over the long term and try to continually improve our service there.
Brian Pitz – UBS
Great, thanks.
Operator
Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with Barclays Capital, please go ahead.
Douglas Anmuth – Barclays Capital
Thanks for taking the question. Thomas, I wanted to ask you about the media business and hoping you could give us a little bit more color in terms of the sub-segments, in particular I think you commented last quarter that physical books were still growing in a double-digit phase, if you could let us know if that’s still the case? And then just one quick housekeeping thing, the equity income line basically was a lot higher than what we’ve seen in recent quarters, can you provide a little bit of color there and how we should think about that going forward? Thanks.
Thomas Szkutak
Sure. First, the media, in terms of – I’ll take the North America, maybe we’re seeing very good growth there, we’re very pleased with the business that we have there. As it relates to books, we saw very strong revenue growth in the quarter, in fact from the unit perspective we saw accelerated growth in both physical and Kindle books in Q3 relative to Q2, so very strong growth during the quarter.
We did see in a couple of our categories some softness, particularly music and video as we overlap some higher revenue in last year Q3 specifically. In the music side, we had very strong growth last year with some of the Michael Jackson titles. We also had very strong growth with the Beatles Box and video games, specifically video game consoles.
There was very strong price reductions from the manufactures and which caused great growth last year and so we saw some softness that’s in the North America media never succeed, but again we are very pleased with overall categories in media.
In terms of the equity income and in terms of how you should think about it, we did have included in our guidance and I will give you the total numbers, but excluded from the guidance that we gave approximately 90 days ago, we did not include Woot acquisition and the impact from the quarter is roughly 30 million in revenue. From a CSOI perspective, we had a few million dollar loss for the quarter.
And then because we had an investment in Woot, we had to step up that investment and fair value, so you have a gain that’s included in the other income line, the equity income line that you’re referring to, which brings our net down to about 15 million net or a little under $0.03 per share, so that’s included in the numbers that you’re looking at.

Our next question comes from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray, please go ahead.
Gene Munster – Piper Jaffray
Hey, good afternoon. If you can talk a little bit about your efforts in China, particularly you’ve rebranded Joyo as Amazon Joyo this spring and I think they are best picking up some traction. Is there any data points you can share with us in terms of number of distribution centers, just general outlook, at what point do you think China particularly can start moving the wheels for Amazon? Thanks.
Thomas Szkutak
Well, China is a very interesting long-term potential and we have businesses growing very fast there. We continue to add capacity there, we continue to work on trying to make sure we have a great experience of customers and so we’re adding a lot of selection, we’re making sure we have great prices. A lot of the things, same things that we’re doing in all of our geography. So we’ll continue to work hard on behalf of customers there and we think it’s a very interesting long-term potential geography force.

Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Lazard Capital Markets.
Greg O'Shara – Lazard Capital Markets
Yes, hi. Greg O'Shara for Colin Sebastian. I was hoping maybe you could help provide some more color on the widening disparity between the electronics, the EGM sectors for North America and international.
I know Zappos and Woot are not included, but surely the widening disparity in growth rates can’t be attributable to that entirely. Are there any fundamental differences that you’re seeing from a trend perspective in that sector internationally versus the US?
Thomas Szkutak
Well, again, you did call out couple items that are rather sizable, particularly the Zappos piece is rather sizable, so that certainly is impacting the size and the growth, because we remember that Zappos isn’t included in the last year’s Q3 result.
But we’re actually very, very pleased with EGM in both segments, they are both growing very fast and as you can see that even in Q3 for international grew 60% on local currency basis, so it’s a very, very strong growth. We’ve added a lot of new categories over the past two years there and they have grown quite nicely. So we’re actually very pleased with our international growth in EGM and very excited about the future there.
Greg O'Shara -- Lazard Capital Markets

And the next question comes from Youssef Squali with Jefferies, please go ahead.
Youssef Squali – Jefferies
Hi, thank you very much. Tom, you guys launched grocery delivery in the U.K., but it doesn’t seem like you guys are doing your own delivery like some of the local competitors, can you speak the strategy there and any plans to launch a similar service in the U.S.
I know you are testing it in a couple of places, but maybe talk about more nationwide rollout? And then just a housekeeping item, how much revenue is baked in your Q4 guidance from the BuyVIP acquisition that you did this quarter? Thank you.
Thomas Szkutak
Okay, I’ll speak to the second one first; BuyVIP hasn’t closed and so it’s not reflected in the guidance that we have given today. In terms of the first question, we think that grocery is very interesting. It’s something that we are – there’s not a lot I can comment about your question, specifically related to the U.K. It’s something that we find it interesting, it’s very early.
Think of it, you mentioned about a national rollout for the U.S., think of it as a test for the U.S. We are testing it currently and have been testing it for a few years in Seattle, and we think that it’s interesting, but again it’s for test and we’ll see how it goes.
Youssef Squali – Jefferies
Okay, thanks.

Our next question comes from Jeetil Patel with Deutsche Bank Securities, please go ahead.
Jeetil Patel – Deutsche Bank Securities
Great, couple of questions. I guess, on the Prime side of the business, do you think you you've built great -- you've built great brand affinity with the Prime service as a whole.
Do you think there are opportunities to bundle or offer additional free products, programs and services within that Prime program? Will the consumer adopt it, and is there maybe different tierings that you can create off of that, in terms of $79 and $89 or $99 with additional products and services folder then?
Then second, around the Kindle side of the business, are there opportunities to leverage Whispersync across other forms of content, such as music and gaming or is there any sort of technical limitations around that? Thanks.
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of the opportunity for Prime, we like what we see in Prime, the way that we would try to expand the benefit to customers to-date has been to try to make sure that we have more selection available for Prime customers. We do that in a number of different ways, one is we add retail offerings, additional retail selection.
We’ve also been working very hard with our seller community filled by Amazon and when you list with fulfilled by Amazon and have availability and stock those products available for our free shipping programs, which is Super Saver Shipping in the US as well as Prime. So those are the things that we have been doing to try to make Prime better. We will continue to look at ways to make Prime even better for customers over time and we will have to wait and see on that. In terms of the second part of your question, I apologize not a lot I can add to answer that question. I apologize in terms of this technology and its use outside of Kindle.
Operator
Just a reminder, please limit yourself to one question. We’ll go to our next questioner Jim Friedland with Cowen and Company, please go ahead.
Jim Friedland – Cowen and Company
Thanks. I have a question about the target deal that’s coming to an end, I believe, its middle of next year. How should we think about modeling that business for next year? Any color you can give us into how it may impact the P&L, I think it’s in the other line in the US? Thanks.
Thomas Szkutak
Yeah, it is, we as you can probably appreciate Jim, we haven’t disclosed anything about any specific, our partnership that we have and this will be no exception. I guess one way to think about it though is with something like this, we continue to grow like we are growing, we will likely need more capacity going forward and so we will be able to use capacity for, in this type of an event.
Jim Friedland - Cowen and Company
Okay, that’s great, thanks.

Our next question is Imran Khan with JP Morgan, please go ahead.
Imran Khan - JP Morgan
Yes, hi it’s Imran. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Two quick questions; one, international gross margins were down 80 basis point year-over-year. Just trying to get a sense like where you stand in terms of ramping up the third party business or some of the new category launch, can you give us some sense what’s driving this international gross margins down and how should we think about it?
And then secondly, the marketing costs were up 63% year-over-year basis. I start to think is it a new normal or is that like more of a one-time kindle marketing going on? If you can shed any light that would be very helpful? Thank you.
Thomas Szkutak
Sure. In terms of international gross margins, there is a number of dynamics there, certainly pricing is impacting it. We are getting very good traction in third party, continue to get good traction in third party within international.
Also keep in mind that we’re talking about one of the earlier questions within EGM we’ve launched many new categories over the past few years that are growing, those categories growing very well as I mentioned the growth is up 60% year-over-year on local currency basis in total and what ends up happening when you launch new categories is many of those are low gross margins at the start and then we worked very hard overtime to be more efficient to buy better and so those categories improve over time. So again those are the things that are impacting gross margins.
In terms of marketing, a couple of things to think about; one, you are right we are a little over 3%, very similar to what we were in increase year-over-year last quarter, the primary area that we spend in marketing is web page search and associates still. Keep in mind that when you look at year-over-year, last year we didn’t have Zappos and we continue to support the marketing efforts for Zappos which is included in that cost.
As you mentioned also, we are also doing some ads from a television standpoint for Kindle included in those numbers as well.
Imran Khan - JP Morgan
Great, thank you very much.

Our next question comes from Sandeep Aggarwal with Caris & Company, please go ahead.
Sandeep Aggarwal – Caris & Company
Alright, Tom, in your prepared remarks you did update us on the spending on procurement center et cetera. I guess the question is that you are spending on fulfillment and centers and as well as IT capacity. If Q4 will take care of most of the higher than norm spending or will you go beyond that? And secondly now that you have three years of history on selling Kindle, in long run will you think the 999 price plan will prevail or a $15? Thank you.
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of the capacity, again we are adding additional capacity in Q4, both from our fulfillment center and infrastructure standpoint, and beyond Q4 we are not commenting but certainly if we continue to grow you should expect like we are growing expect that we will add capacity next year. In terms of Kindle, we are trying to make selection available from a content perspective at great prices for customers and that’s no different than any other product that we offer to customers, we think it should be very economic to customers and we will continue to work very hard on behalf of customers in that area.
Operator
And our next question comes from Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse, please go ahead.
Spencer Wang – Credit Suisse
Thanks, good afternoon. First question, I guess, Tom, can you just go back to your earlier comment about video on demand and I think you used a phrase “room for innovation,” any more kind of color you could shed there in terms of how you are thinking about it, is it innovation in terms of pricing or selection or revenue model or UI? And then secondly just real quick any stats or data point you could give us in terms of sizing mobile commerce for you. Thank you.
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of video in demand, there is not a lot more I can add to that. I would say that I guess that where I would think about it is not a lot different than a lot of the things that we do on Amazon, we have a foundation of innovation everything that we do and we try to find creative ways and innovative ways to serve customers better and so that’s grained very well in the culture, you have seen that in a lot of different ways in our various offerings and we will continue to do that as best we can on behalf of the customers over long term which includes Video On Demand. And then second part of our question, sorry was…
Spencer Wang – Credit Suisse
So any data point on mobile, sizing mobile for you guys commerce?
Thomas Szkutak
No, again I think I don’t have any new data to share with you there. It is an interesting area for us, and if you think about just a growth in connected devices anytime, you can have a very fast growth in adoption of connected devices in around the world where customers can get easy access to amzon.com, we think it’s a good thing to tail in for us and so what we are trying to do is try to make that as easy for customers with APIs and another ways so that we can serve customers well, so they get a great experience when they connect with their device. So that’s something that certainly we are working and we find it interesting.
Spencer Wang – Credit Suisse
Thanks.
Operator
And for our final question from Justin Post with Bank of America.
Justin Post – Bank of America
Thank you. First on the Kindle, a lot of language in your press release about it, can you help us at all understand if it’s margin accretive on the gross margin line when you think about the hardware and software or not and then secondly you are making a lot of infrastructure investments, a lot of headcount investments in the course of Fulfillment, can you give us any visibility if you think you’re kind of caught up now this year given the spending last year or this is something that no idea of kind of wind, when you are kind of going to be caught up with what you need to be? Thank you.
Thomas Szkutak
Sure. The first part as you can probably appreciate, we don’t break out any of our products or categories from a possibility standpoint and so we have a [Inaudible] doing that and so the details that we provided, to-data is just the North American International segment from a possibility standpoint.
So, I can’t help you much there. In terms of infrastructure and capacity, just sort of - excuse me in terms of film capacity, you’re right we added a lot of capacity to date, we have some more that we are adding in Q4 and that’s the serve on demand that we think is in front of us and we will have to see, wait and see what happens over the coming quarters to see what capacity we need to have.
But what I can say is from our regional perspective; you can see our overall growth rates are very strong. And if they continue to be strong, we will have to add additional capacity. We are seeing very good traction fulfilled by Amazon which is also why we are also adding capacity for and we like that part of the business from a seller perspective a lot.
From an infrastructure standpoint, again just with the growth that we are seeing from a retail perspective, we are adding capacity to support the retail websites that we have around the world. In addition to that, we have a very fast growing web services business that has great traction, continues to grow well and certainly should expect that we will add capacity there over time to serves that growth.
Justin Post – Bank of America
Thank you.
Thomas Szkutak
Great. Well, thank you all for joining us today on the call and for your questions. The replay will be available on our industrial relations website at least to the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest and look forward to talking with you again in next quarter. Thanks everyone.

Good day, and welcome to the Amazon Quarterly Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rob Eldridge, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Robert Eldridge
Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2010 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. 
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 22, 2010 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. 
As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. 
During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2009. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas Szkutak
Thanks, Rob. I'll begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12-month free cash flow grew 29% to $1.99 billion. Return on invested capital is 34%, down from 42%. ROIC is TTM-free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. 
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 465 million shares compared with 451 million shares. Worldwide revenue grew 41% to $6.57 billion, or 42%, excluding the $48 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in FX. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, fast selection with free shipping offers, including Amazon Prime. 
Media revenue increased to $2.87 billion, up 18%. EGM revenue increased to $3.49 billion, up 69%, or 70% excluding foreign exchange rates. Worldwide EGM increased to 53% of worldwide sales, up from 45%. Worldwide unit growth was 39%. Active customer accounts exceeded 118 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million, up 19%. Seller units were 32% of total units. 
Consolidated gross profit grew 42% to $1.61 billion, and gross margin was 24.5%. Beginning this quarter, we no longer allocate Fulfillment costs related to the third-party inventory to cost of sales. Using our prior method, gross margin in Q2 2010 was 24.1%. 
Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content in G&A combined was $1.2 billion, or 18.3% of sales, up 50 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $558 million, or 8.5% of revenue, compared with 8.4%. Using the prior method of allocating Fulfillment costs related to third-party inventory to cost of sales, Q2 2010 Fulfillment was 8.1% of revenue. Tech and content was $350 million or 5.3% of revenue, compared with 5.5%. Marketing was $204 million, or 3.1% of revenue, up from 2.7% in the prior year. 
Now I'll talk about our segment results and, consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate segments, our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. 
In the North America segment, revenue grew 46% to $3.59 billion. Media revenue grew 15% to $1.32 billion. The sequential decline in quarter-over-quarter growth rates was driven primarily by seasonality in textbook sales and slower rates of growth in video games and video game consoles. 
EGM revenue grew 76% to $2.09 billion, representing 58% of North America revenues, up from 48%. North America segment operating income increased 61% to $200 million; a 5.6% operating margin. 
In the International segment, revenue grew 35% to $2.98 billion. Revenue growth was 38%, adjusting for the $54 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact during the quarter. Media revenue grew 20% to $1.55 billion, or 21% excluding foreign exchange rates. And EGM revenue grew 59% to $1.4 billion, or 63% excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM now represents 47% of International revenues, up from 40%. 
International segment operating income increased 15% to $206 million; a 6.9% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, International segment operating income increased 21%. 
CSOI grew 34% to $406 million, or 6.2% of revenue; down 35 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $10 million unfavorable impact from FX, CSOI grew 37%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 71% to $270 million, or 4.1% of net sales. Q2 2009 operating income was negatively impacted by a $51 million legal settlement. 
Our income tax expense was $88 million in Q2, or a 30% rate for the quarter. During the quarter, we recorded estimated tax expense associated with tentative agreements between the Japanese and the U.S. tax authorities on the allocation of income between the U.S. and Japan for 2003 through 2005, resulting in a three percentage point increase in our effective tax rate for the quarter. 
GAAP net income was $207 million or $0.45 per diluted share compared with $142 million and $0.32 per diluted share. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $1.9 billion year-over-year to $5.11 billion. Inventory increased 46% to $1.94 billion and inventory turns were 12.5, up from 12.4 turns a year ago, even as we extended selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. 
Accounts payable increased 41% to $3.55 billion, and accounts payable days were 65, unchanged from the prior-year. Our Q2 2010 capital expenditures were $196 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments and support of continued business growth, including capacity to support our Fulfillment operations, additional investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services, and investments in corporate office space. We expect this trend to continue throughout 2010. 
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and net foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently. 
For Q3, we expect net sales of between $6.9 billion and $7.625 billion, a growth between 27% and 40%. This guidance anticipates approximately 300 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. 
GAAP operating income to be between $210 million and $310 million, or between a 16% decline and 24% growth. This anticipates approximately $130 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate Consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expenses to be between $340 million and $440 million, or be between 3% decline and 26% growth. 
We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting the customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. 
Thanks. And with that, Rob, let's move to questions.
Robert Eldridge
Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Jeetil Patel from Deutsche Bank.
[ :p id=""27825561"" name=""Jeetil Patel"" />
First of all, I guess as it relates to, broadly, Fulfillment. I guess can you talk about -- maybe a little bit more color on Fulfillment capacity being layered into the business? I guess, is that both Domestic and International, or just more of a U.S. kind of phenomenon? Maybe a bit more color on, I guess, how much of this incremental capacity is being allocated to your partners, seller partners out there. And I guess is this the build-up in front of the holiday season that you typically do? And then second, are you seeing consumers still buy more books in an environment where consumers have the Kindle App available on multiple devices these days?
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of answering your first question, just to clarify. On the performance expense as a percentage of revenue, we have historically reallocated some of our cost from operating expenses to COGS. And when we stopped reporting gross margins last quarter, we decided this quarter not to allocate some of our cost out of operating expenses and into COGS. And the impact of that is a little over 40 basis points as a percentage of revenue. So in other words, our operating expenses for Fulfillment are about 40 basis points, as a percentage of revenue, higher than they would have been if that we have not done this. And the offset is in COGS. So then if you take a look at it, those Fulfillment expenses, we are growing very, very fast. And so we're adding capacity to support growth. And we plan on adding 13 Fulfillment centers this year after keeping our Fulfillment center structure relatively flat. Last year, we did add some capacity, but we're certainly adding a lot more this year. And that's, again, to support that growth. That's both in terms of our retail customers as well as Fulfillment by Amazon, our partners. And your question around whether it's Domestic or International, it's across geographies. So it’s 13 Fulfillment centers across geographies. And so we're very excited about it because, again, we're experiencing a look at our overall growth rates at 42% on a local currency basis. This quarter, 42%; last quarter, 37% in Q4. So again, we're growing very, very strong. So and then in terms of your second question, could you just elaborate a little bit further? I didn't...
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank AG
I think early on when the Kindle device came out, you had just actually talked about how consumers were purchasing more books through the Kindle device. Are you seeing, now that you have a Kindle App that resides in multiple different devices, products out there in the marketplace, are you seeing consumers buy more books via the Kindle App?
Thomas Szkutak
What we're seeing is strong growth on Kindle as well as the Apps. So we're seeing very, very strong growth on Kindle. So it's really across the board, is what you’re saying.
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank AG
Is this idea of the cloud-based computing for books really resonating with consumers today? Is the idea of this cloud-based kind of format of reading or having availability of digital books resonating with consumers, such that I can read my book on a PC, my BlackBerry and my iPhone and Kindle, and switch around depending on what's convenient for me? Is that…
Thomas Szkutak
It certainly is. And customers can come and buy content on the Kindle, and buy it once and use it everywhere, which is great. And so we're seeing -- as you probably saw in the release from earlier in the week, we’re seeing very, very strong device growth and we're seeing very, very strong content growth. And we're extremely pleased with what we're seeing there.
Operator
And our next question is from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.
Scott Devitt - Morgan Stanley
Tom, if you go back over the past four quarters, on average, you had been beating the midpoint of your revenue guidance by approximately 7% in op inc [operating income] by about 27%. And in the second quarter, revenue was towards the high-end of guidance, but the operating income was at the midpoint. So could you maybe talk about anything in the business that you felt that changed in the quarter? Or how we should think about your forward-operating guidance, going forward relative to now the past five quarters?
Thomas Szkutak
When we set out guidance, we’re trying to be very helpful. We’re trying to be giving you our best forecast of what's going to happen during the quarter. We have had some times where we've been on the high-end of that and been over it, but certainly when we provide guidance, that's not what we're trying to do. We're trying to give an accurate description of what we think the range will be. And so we approach it the same way every time and we give the guidance that we think is appropriate. And as you mentioned, our results today are well within -- it's in the top half for revenue guidance. It's also in the top half for Consolidated segment operating income as well.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from James Mitchell from Goldman Sachs.
James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
Could you talk about why the International operating margins are trending down, while the Domestic operating margins are trending up? Does that primarily reflect makeshift in terms of third-party and EGM within each market, or more for the 13 new Fulfillment centers outside North America than inside it? And to what extent are the 13 new Fulfillment centers already hitting expenses in the second quarter versus coming in in the third quarter?
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of International. First of all, I want to highlight a couple things related to International. International saw an accelerated growth this quarter. It was 38% growth on a local currency basis. That's the strongest growth rate in any quarter that we've had in International in over five years. So we saw very good growth. And there’s a number of things that's driving it. We've added a lot of selection over the past few years. If you look back and you see just the categories that we've launched over the past few years, we continue to add selection in existing categories, but in those new categories that we've launched over the past few years. And so that growth from new and existing categories is certainly doing quite well. We're making sure that we're very competitive from a pricing standpoint, which is helping. And certainly, other things such as Prime is having a noticeable impact on the growth rate there. So that's really what's driving the growth rate. And with that accelerated growth rate in some of those newer categories, we're seeing some mix. Again, we have a number of categories that are very new there over the past few years, and they're coming up the scale. But it's still very early. So you should assume that many of those are lower gross margin categories and you can see that reflected in the EGM growth within International. So again, saw very, very strong growth there. In terms of Fulfillment centers, I mentioned this to, I think, it was to Jeetil’s question earlier. We haven't -- the plan is to add 13. You're seeing some of the cost starting in Q2 for some of those Fulfillment centers and you see more, as reflected in our guidance for Q3. But again, they’re dispersed in a number of different geographies.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Mark Mahaney with Citi.
Mark Mahaney - Citigroup Inc
The tax rate. There are one-time items in that sound like, the way you’ve described it, [indiscernible] going forward? Secondly, do you think it would be apples-to-apples North America and International gross margin under the old accounting methodologies? And then third, you talked about marketing expenses? [indiscernible] to pick up. Is there some change in your strategy or did you find marketing expense in this quarter?
Thomas Szkutak
We did mention on a tax rate standpoint, our tax rate was 30%. Yes, if there’s any one-time unusuals, I think is what you asked for, there was one that I mentioned in my opening remarks related to Japan. And we have a tentative agreement there, and the impact of that is about 300 basis points on that tax rate. So without that, it would've been approximately 27% for the quarter. In terms of marketing, you asked a question around marketing. Our approach has been consistent. The spend that you're seeing during the quarter is primarily online. If you're looking at the year-over-year growth that you're seeing in terms of basis points, certainly, we have Zappos and our quarterly numbers, which we didn't have last year. And if you -- many of you probably saw the results prior to consolidating and they were spending at a percentage of revenue, a much greater rate than Amazon was. And you should assume that they're still spending at a rate that's faster than Amazon and that's reflected in that total. You also may have noticed that we're doing some broad-skill advertising, TV advertising for Kindle, which we think is the right thing to do, and included in the number that you see there.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch
Looks like you added 2,200 people in the quarter. Could you explain where those people are mostly centered toward? Are they on digital initiatives, maybe helping improve the Kindle or are they more Fulfillment center-related? And secondly, any timeframe from when kind of the personnel ramp-up could kind of slow down? Is that next year or is it sooner than that?
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of the growth, sequential growth from Q1 to Q2, we did add 2,200 people. The majority of those were operations people. And within that operation, the majority of those were to support new volume; I should say, the volume that we're seeing. And so that's within there. The rest of the growth rate, supporting the things that we've been talking about over the past several years. We're supporting new category growth both in North America and International. We're supporting the growth in Kindle, supporting our Seller business, supporting our fast-growing Web Services business. Those are the things that we're supporting to grow our business going forward.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from James Friedland with Cowen and Company.
James Friedland - Cowen and Company, LLC
Looking at free cash flow, it seems like it's unusually low for Q2. And I know it moves around, but it looks like part of the reason is ramping up on inventory a little earlier in the year. Can you provide some color around that?
Thomas Szkutak
Well, our inventory, actually, our turns improved slightly year-over-year, about a 10th of a turn. So we're pleased with what we see there. You're right, you do have some volatility in free cash flow. Certainly, one of the things that you're seeing is CapEx was $196 million in the quarter, which is up and that's really in a few different pieces, but certainly, the incremental spend relates to capacity that's both on the Fulfillment side as well as infrastructure side and the infrastructure side to support our Retail business as well as fast-growing AWS business.
James Friedland - Cowen and Company, LLC
And on that CapEx, should we look at that roughly $200 million you're spending per quarter? I know there's $100 million of incremental expense in for the year for the new facility move. But is that sort of a baseline excluding that facility impact?
Thomas Szkutak
Q3 should be our highest quarter of the year so far, and you should expect that number to be more than $300 million during Q3. And again, we plan to add 13 Fulfillment centers this year. We plan to add infrastructure capacity to support our faster-growing business, which includes AWS. And on the Fulfillment side, it's not just to support our retail business but to support our FBA business, supporting our Cellar partners so in addition to the office space comments that you made.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We go to Brian Pitz with UBS.
Brian Pitz - UBS Investment Bank
Should we expect an even larger ramp-up as a percent of revenue in Q4, given more aggressive spending on Kindle? And can you talk about what's driving acceleration in other revenue? Is it Amazon products ads or Web Services?
Thomas Szkutak
I heard the first question, but could you repeat the second part?
Brian Pitz - UBS Investment Bank
Could you discuss the acceleration in other revenues? Is it some of your initiatives in Amazon product ads or maybe Web Services?
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of other revenue, there's a number of things that are in there, but certainly, our Web Services business is included in other revenue and it's growing very fast. So we're certainly seeing that. In terms of marketing, we're not giving guidance on any specific line item in Q3 in our guidance, and we're not giving any guidance at this point for Q4. But I would expect that we're going to approach marketing very similar to what you've seen over the past quarter. The vast majority of it will be online. We would still expect our Zappos team to continue to market as they have, and as you've seen so far this quarter, we've been doing some TV ads for Kindle during the quarter as well. So all of that would be included in our marketing and reflected in our guidance.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Doug Anmuth from Barclays Capital.
Douglas Anmuth - Barclays Capital
Tom, I was hoping you could comment on the North America media business, and in particular, it grew 15% on certainly an easier comp from last year. You pointed to a couple things there. But any more detail that you can provide here and how much, I guess in particular, is this related to the digital success that you're having through the Kindle?
Thomas Szkutak
The growth rate, the deceleration that you see is driven primarily by seasonality in textbook and also weakness in video games and video games consoles. From a textbook standpoint, it's very seasonal. It was growing very fast in Q1. It's not as much of an impact in Q2 as you would imagine and then, the weakness in video games and video game consoles due to allocations on the console side and also a lack of major releases. But in terms of growth from the book side, if you've seen the release earlier in the weak, we're seeing a very, very strong growth in both Kindle device, which is in EGM, as well as Kindle content, which is in media. So it's growing very, very fast. But our fiscal book business, while the Kindle books are growing dramatically, is also growing double digits year-over-year in the quarter. So we're very pleased with our overall book business, both our physical and digital business.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Spencer Wang with Crédit Suisse.
Spencer Wang - Crédit Suisse AG
Tom, can you give us a sense of roughly the impact from the Zappos acquisition in the quarter? And also, was there any impact from the change in the Kindle hardware accounting?
Thomas Szkutak
Yes, in terms of those two pieces, we're not breaking those out. I think a way to think about it, though, is if you look at our EGM growth rate from North America, which is where those two things would occur, if you back those up, we still saw an accelerated growth rate. So again, we're not providing individual product line details in this case, but that's what we're seeing.
Spencer Wang - Crédit Suisse AG
And on the accounting change, Tom?
Thomas Szkutak
Was including both of those in that number when I said that.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Shawn Milne with Janney Capital Markets.
Shawn Milne - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Just first on a housekeeping front, can you give us a sense for what kind of capacity, the percent of capacity that you would be adding with a 13 distribution centers? Any sense of magnitude there would be helpful. And secondly, if you can give us any color on just the pace of business through the second quarter, June relative to April.
Thomas Szkutak
Yes, in terms of the number of Fulfillment centers, 13 is on a base of just under 40 to size it a little bit. And in terms of pace, we don't give updates on inter-quarter. But again, as you can see from our overall growth rate, we saw very, very strong growth in Q2, up 42% on a local currency basis, 46% from North America, 38% for international. International was the best growth rate of any quarter we've had in a little over five years. So it's very strong. There was World Cup going on about 20 days, the last 20 days of the quarter. And hard to say what kind of impact that had, but I'm sure it had some impact but that was included in that 38% growth on a local currency basis. But again, we're not a bellwether for the economy, and we focus very hard on expanding selection and making sure we have great prices and making sure that we have great convenience for customers, including Amazon Prime. So those are the things that we're focused on, and it was really what's driving the growth that we see today.
Shawn Milne - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Just a quick follow-up on the 13 distribution centers out of the 40 plus, I'm assuming that these are more regional in nature and that, blended, the average of the square footage would be a little bit lower than what we've seen from some of the sort of early distribution centers. Is that a fair take?
Thomas Szkutak
It was 13 on just under 40 and not just over 40, and we're not providing the square footage details. But I would think of them as varying size and in different regions.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Imran Khan from JPMorgan.
Imran Khan - JP Morgan Chase & Co
It seems like CapEx grew fifth straight quarter and look like at 15% of your revenue and depreciation and amortization grew like 53%. So how should we think about the CapEx? What's driving this CapEx growth? So that's question number one. And question number two, it seems like high end, you're guiding 40% revenue growth but operating income growth rate of 24%. So what's driving the deleverage? And the third, how many Kindle Apps for iPad has been downloaded? Can you give us some sense on that?
Thomas Szkutak
Sure, I'll take your CapEx question first. The largest pieces of the increase are related to capacity, and it's capacity both from a Fulfillment perspective and an infrastructure perspective. When I say Fulfillment, it's to support our fast-growing Retail business as well as our fast-growing Fulfillment by Amazon business, where we fulfill on behalf of our partners. From a infrastructure standpoint, we're supporting, again, our Retail business but also we have a AWS business that's growing very, very strong right now, and so we're supporting that growth by adding CapEx. So that's what's included in the CapEx. 
In terms of the range of guidance, I just wanted to clarify a little bit. You said the upper end of the range was 40%. Keep in mind that, that anticipates approximately 300 basis points of unfavorable exchange rates, so at the high end of the range, it's more like 43% as well as on the bottom end of the range for CSOI, you mentioned 24%, it's actually 26%, and that anticipates approximately 600 basis points of exchange. So at the high end of the range, it would be 43% growth x exchange for revenue, 32% growth x -- excuse me, on the high end of the range, 43% excluding exchange for revenue and 32% growth excluding exchange on CSOI. And again, it reflects our best estimate for the high end of that range and the things that we see. But again, it anticipates some of the things that I'm talking about. It anticipates the capacity that will show up in CapEx as well as operating expense across a number of different fronts. And then the rest of the operating expenses in support of the things that we've been talking about, again, for the last several year, it's the growing retail business, both in North America and international, our Seller business, AWS, our Kindle business, Seller business, if I didn't say that. So again, those are the things that we're adding resources to, to support the opportunities that we see going forward.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Colin Sebastian with Lazard.
Colin Sebastian - Lazard Capital Markets LLC
One clarification on the media segment given the questions there, was the performance in that segment under your expectations for the quarter? And then secondly, I'm curious about your view of the consumer environment versus 90 days ago and if you're preparing for this holiday period any differently than maybe you were last year at this time.
Thomas Szkutak
We're very, very pleased with the media growth, and so we're very pleased with what we saw. We're extremely pleased with our Kindle content growth. And again, as I mentioned, our physical books also grew double digits year-over-year during the quarter. So we're very, very pleased with overall books business as related to that. And again, we saw our sequential decline based on, primarily, the textbook sales seasonality and also some weakness in video games and video game consoles, again, due to allocations and lack of major releases. Even though we saw weakness in our video games and video game console business, we're still very pleased with that business, and we think we're doing -- the team's doing a great job in terms of the fundamental supporting customers, and we like the opportunities that we see there.  In terms of the consumer sentiment, again, I don't think we're the bellwether. What we're seeing is reflected in our Q2 results, which were from a growth standpoint, very, very strong.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Sandeep Aggarwal with Caris and company.
Sandeep Aggarwal - Caris & Company
Tom, can you talk about maybe the average selling price for the Kindle e-books and even if we don't want to talk about the exact pricing, maybe directionally how they have trended last two quarters? And secondly, the price reduction in Kindle device in June, is it fair to assume that it was gross margin mostly?
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of the ASP in Kindle, I can't help you with the average. But what I can help you with is if you take a look at some of the details that we provided earlier in the week, and I'll point you to that release where we have over 630,000 titles, 510,000 of those were $9.99 or below. That excludes the $1.8 million pre-1923 free content that we have in the Kindle. So there's just great values and great selection for customers. And we're seeing that customers responding to that great selection and the convenience of the device, the convenience of the apps. The fact that you can buy at once on Kindle and read it in many different places is really important to customers. And again, there's just great values there as well.
Sandeep Aggarwal - Caris & Company
And Tom, just in terms of growth, the price reduction in the Kindle device?  Is it...
Thomas Szkutak
I've not commented on the individual margins of any product line, but what I would say is not unlike any product that we sell, we're trying to make sure that we can get the best values to customers, and we're committed to doing that. And we think we're very fortunate to see -- when we dropped our price from $259 down to $189, we started tripling of growth rate, which we're extremely pleased to see. And we're very happy with our Kindle business and it has great momentum right now.
Operator
And we'll take our last question from Heath Terry with FBR Capital Markets.
Heath Terry - FBR Capital Markets & Co.
Can you give us a sense of what kind of traction you're seeing for Kindle at Target since the rollout there? And then, looking at the category expansion in International, how much expansion do you have left given the verticals that you've added before the offering outside the U.S. starts to parallel what you're offering inside the U.S.?
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of Target, we have a longstanding practice of not talking about any results from a specific partner. But we're pleased overall with our growth in Kindle all the way around, and we're pleased with our relationship there. In terms of International, we have -- we're still adding a lot of selections in International in each of the categories that we're in, older categories that we've been in for years as well as the newer categories that I mentioned earlier and still think there's the tremendous opportunity to add selection there. Keep in mind that we also have, within International, an opportunity to add new geographies and new categories and selection, obviously, in those geographies. So we think there's great opportunities there.

Good day everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com First Quarter 2010 Financial Results Conference. (Operator Instructions) At this time I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Rob Eldridge. Please go ahead sir.
Rob Eldridge
Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2010 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.
The following discussion or responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 22, 2010, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K.
As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.
During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2009. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom.
Tom Szkutak 
Thanks Rob, I will begin with comments on our financial results. Trolling 12 month free cash grew 62% to $2.32 billion. Return on invested capital is 45% up from 41%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow, divided by average total assets, minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long term debt over 5 quarter ends.
The combination of common stock and stock based towards outstanding 463 million shares compared with 447 million. World wide revenue grew 46% to $7.13 billion or 42% excluding the $185 million payable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates.
We are grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and pre-shipping offers including Amazon Prime. Media revenue increased to $3.43 up 26% or 22% excluding foreign exchange rates. ETM revenue increased to $3.51 billion of 72% or 68% excluding FX. World wide EGM increased to 49% of world wide sales up from 42%.
World wide unit growth was 40%; active customer accounts exceeded a 114 million. And for the first time this number includes our Amazon China customer accounts. World-wide active seller accounts were approximately $2 million of 22%. Sold units were 31% of total units. Consolidated gross profit grew 42% to $1.63 billion and gross margin decreased 62 basis points up to 22.9%.
We no longer present gross profit as our consolidated statement of operations as we believe income from operations is more meaningful measure due to the diversity of our product categories and services. Our focus is on growing operating profit dollars rather than maximizing margin percentages.
Now I will discuss operating expenses, excluding stock based compensation. Fulfillment in marketing tech and content and G&A combined was $1.12 billion or 15.8% of sales down 115 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $528 million or 7.4% of revenue compared with 8.3%.
Tech and content was $319 million or 4.5% of revenue compared with 4.9%. Marketing was $196 million or 2.7% of revenue, up from 2.5% in the prior year. Now I will talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or stock based compensation or other operating expense line items.
In North America segment, revenue grew 47% to $3.78 billion. Media revenue grew 22% to $1.6 billion. EGM revenue grew 72% to $2.02 billion, representing 54% of North America revenues, up from 45%. North America segment operating income increased 81% to $273 million, or 7.2% operating margin.
In the international segment, revenue grew 45% to $3.35 billion. Revenue growth was 37%, adjusting for the $175 million year-over-year favorable FX impact during the quarter.
Media revenue grew 29% to $1.83 billion or 23% excluding FX. And EGM revenue grew 68% to $1.49 billion or 61% excluding FX. EGM now represents 44% of international revenues, up from 38%.
International segment operating income increased 37% to $234 million, a 7% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange rates international segment operating income increased 26%. CSOI grew 58% to $507 million or 7.1% of revenue up 53 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $15 million favorable impact from foreign exchange rates, CSOI grew 53%.
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 62% to $394 million or 5.5% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $100 million in Q1 or a 25% rate for the quarter. GAAP net income was $299 million of course, $0.66 per diluted share compared with $177 million and $0.41 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.33 billion year-over-year to $5.06 billion. Inventory increased 44% to $1.82 billion and inventory turns were 12.6 up from 12.5 turns a year ago, even as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories.
Accounts payable increased 52% to $3.62 billion and accounts payable days increased to 59 from 57 in the prior year.
Our Q1 2010 capital expenditures were $140 million, the increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in technology infrastructure including Amazon web services, additional investments and support of continued business growth including capacity to support fulfillment operations and investments and corporate office-base which we expect to continue throughout 2010.
I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into the guidance of the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe to date to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as global economy and consumer spending.
It’s not possible to accurately predict and end and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we describe in more detail in our public filings issues such as settling inter company balances and foreign currency amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance.
Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions or stock based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange remained approximately where they have been recently.
For Q2 we expect net sales of between $6.1 and $6.7 billion or growth of between 31% and 44%. This anticipates approximately 100 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income could be between $220 and $320 million or grow between 39% and 102%.
The second quarter 2009 results include the impact of our settlement with Toys “R” Us for $51 million substantially all of which was expensed during the quarter. This includes approximately $130 million for stock based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income which excludes stock based compensation and other operating expense to be between $350 and $450 million, a growth of between 15% and 48%. We remain head strong focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe the prudent customer first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks and with that Rob let's move to questions.
Rob Eldridge
Great, thanks Tom, let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) And we will go first to Colin Sebastian with Lazard Capital Markets.
Colin Sebastian - Lazard Capital Markets
Thanks, and congratulations on a very strong quarter. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the same day delivery program, how that's playing out in cities where it's offered and if there is something that could be rolled out more broadly amid successful testing in the existing markets? Thanks.
Tom Szkutak
Sure and probably the best way to describe it is similar to other programs that we have related to past shipping in prime. We are finding that customers like it, we certainly think that new customers like the reliability of getting their products so efficiently, so quickly and hard to say what we do beyond what we are doing today with same day but we certainly think that getting product to customers fast is important.
Operator
We will go next to James Mitchell with Goldman Sachs.
James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs
I have two question, one is with regard to the very large active customer number that include China but with Zappos I assumed I would like may 5 million each from China and from Zappos if you did include Zappos. And then secondly even I look at the expansion in North America and operating margins in the quarter. With that helped by sales of digital media and also of Amazon web services thank you?
Tom Szkutak
I will take the second part first, you know the North America expansion was driven by you know a number of things certainly the very strong growth and then it was also driven by you know us being able to leverage raw expenses if you take a look at our global fulfillment type cost as a percentage of revenue you can certainly see a lot of leverage there and that’s also true when you look at North America.
We haven’t added you know any significant capacity in North America since Q3 of 08. You know certainly with growth rates that you are seeing, you should expect that we will be adding capacity over time there. But again it was driven by a lot of different factors and you know with a lot of different product categories are growing very strong and thus being able to leverage those expenses. In terms of the first part can you repeat the first part again it was related to?
James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs
On the customers does that include China and also Zappos or just China and is it fair to assume that each of China and Zappos which contribute about 5 million active customers?
Tom Szkutak
Yeah James you are correct the active customer does not include Zappos but it does include China this quarter for the first time. And we are not at this point breaking out the addition of China at this point. So it is 114 million active customers world wide at this point.
Operator
We’ll go next to Douglas Anmuth with Barclays Capital.
Douglas Anmuth - Barclays Capital
Thanks, just two quick questions, can you comment on the head count when you went about 1800 people on a sequential basis certainly larger number then we would have expected. And then the second one is just the tax rate being a little bit higher at 25% and is that purely just a function of higher North America profit?
Tom Szkutak
The first part in terms of head count, the biggest piece of that is related to fulfillment. You know when we coming out of Q4 we always have a certain people additions related to that and so again a sizeable piece of that incremental headcount was due to operations in the rest was you know certainly in the areas to help us grow as we move forward. In terms of the effective tax rate certainly the mix of our geographies are certainly what’s making that change.
Operator
We will go next to Youssef Squali with Jefferies & Co.
Youssef Squali - Jefferies & Co.
First one of your competitors talks about seeing some weakness in Europe. Ex-UK and looking at your international margins it looks like they came little bit under pressure. They were down by 40 or 50 bps year-on-year. Is that something you guys saw as well and then by our estimates are the change in accounting for Kindle that you instituted in Q1 resulted, again by our map in somewhere between $80 and $100 million of additional revenues for the quarter, can you maybe just help us understand if we are in the right zip code there?
Tom Szkutak
The first question, we are not bringing out individual geographies within the international segment but what you are seeing in the international is you know very strong growth and we were pleased across all of our geographies we saw excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates we saw growth of 37%, you know, which is certainly very good and it was driven by a number of things certainly we have added many new categories and a lot of selections over the past few years and we certainly have or focused on making sure that we have great and a competitive low prices and that would certainly fuel in growth prime is also a factor and third-party growth, continues to be very strong and so those are the factors that are driving the international growth.
In terms of the change in accounting for Kindle, we are not breaking out any precise numbers on that but the way you should think about it is, may be a few (inaudible) one is if you look at our overall growth rate and you look at on a local currency basis and we certainly have for the first time of four quarter of Zappos included in those numbers as well as the change in accounting for Kindle and if you back off, exchange in those two items and compare it to the equivalent growth rate in Q4, you did see, a few hundred basis points, acceleration and growth from Q4 to Q1.
So, it can be much more of a breakup than that but you can see that, we did an acceleration growth there.
Operator
We’ll go next to Brian Pitz with UBS.
Brian Pitz - UBS
It was your comment on the impetus to begin selling the Kindle through brick-and-motor stores, then do you expect to make the device more widely available? Also, I’m just curious why the rollout is limited to so few stores, thanks.
Tom Szkutak
Well it’s starting with a small number of stores but we are very pleased to be working with Target and we think we are very pleased to have even more customers see Kindle and have the opportunity to purchase Kindle. So that’s why we are doing it and we are very excited to do it.
Brian Pitz - UBS
Right.

We will go next to Mark Mahaney with Citi.
Mark Mahaney - Citi
I know why you may not want to talk so much about gross margins. I understand you're running the business for operating profits and then cash flow. But could you provide a little bit more color on the gross margin trends, particularly in international markets, given what should be some pretty positive mix shifts and scale factors, but mix shifts towards the digital goods and AWS and things like that. The trends seem a little surprising. Anything in terms of vendor terms, product mixes that may have explained the gross margin trends. Thank you.
Tom Szkutak
In terms of international it was primarily driven by a certainly number of factors we continue to have lower prices and make sure we have great competitive prices and a challenging environment which includes free shipping offers and it was on prime included in that and keep in mind that we’ve launched many new categories over the past few years and so as we talked about in the past it takes sometime to get the scale in those categories and we are seeing very broad growth across many categories including the new categories and so that’s certainly that mix is having an impact and that means all those factors have been partially offset by very strong solid third-party growth as well as the savings that we will get from our vendor partners so again those are the key drivers.
Mark Mahaney - Citi
And one quick follow up on marketing for the Kindle, is there any change in your thinking of the level of marketing support you want to provide given obviously a much more competitive environment?
Tom Szkutak
Well in terms of marketing itself you saw that it increased a little bit as a percentage of revenue year-over-year and we are doing advertising for Kindle, it's certainly a product and an area that we are very excited about. You probably seen some of the ads that we are doing as well as doing on my marketing.
Operator
We will go next to Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.
Scott Devitt - Morgan Stanley
Great, thanks for taking the question. The first quarter operating margin was 7.1% and at the midpoint of revenue and operating margin on a cash basis in Q2 I think it's 6.3% so Tom could you just talk through what the factors are that would drive operating down sequentially that order of magnitude and then secondly, stock based compensation I think you guided to $110 million and did $87 million and then guided to $130 million in 2Q, so what's the volatility in that line item -- in the first quarter and going forward, thanks.
Tom Szkutak
Sure, I will take the second part first. The 87 is actually the equivalent of stock based compensation amortization intangibles which is one 113. And so it's come from 113 to 130. In terms of the operating margin, we are not giving operating margin guidance for Q2 but implied operating margin and we do have a consistent what we have done in prior periods. We have a range of operating income and that range is 350 to 450 at the low end of the range it's 5.7% of implied operating margin and 6.7 on the high end. On the high end you would see an expansion of operating margins of approximately 20 basis year-over-year and so that’s the guidance based upon what we see if by looking at all the factors and there is not much I can help you with that. I would one thing to keep in mind those I mentioned in one of the earlier questions, with growth we are experiencing, we need to make sure we support that growth. And what that means is we will continue to add capacity at our various businesses to support that growth whether it be our retail business or AWS business or third-party seller business including FBA.
And so those are things that we certainly are supporting giving the growth that we are having. The other thing is we will continue as we haven’t in prior years. We still think there is a lot of opportunity in front of us and so as we haven’t prior years. We’ll make sure that we are judicious about where we make those additions. But we will add resources to make sure that we capitalize on those growth opportunities. So those are the things that we are thinking about.
Operator
We will go next to Jeetil Patel, with Deutsche Bank Securities
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank Securities
And thank you. Two questions. I guess the unit growth nicely accelerated from the fourth quarter levels, and the trend line you have been seeing historically, I guess can you talk about whether that is more of a function of the domestic business and still seeing very good purchase frequency or international now participating as Prime has now been out there for well north of two years? And then second just broader question, but in a world where we are going towards mobile and smartphones from an immediate consumption standpoint, can you, I guess, talk about what is the opportunity from an e-commerce standpoint? Do you think that it will be just as good of an e-commerce-oriented environment on a mobile device as you see in a desktop internet world since it’s a smaller form factor, smaller screen? How do you have to change if you have to in terms of how you present information to consumers? 14th file
Tom Szkutak
Jeetil, I will take the second part of your question first. We are excited about the idea that the world may shift to a place where 3G connected devices are available to browse net and our view is that the more of web connected devices whether be tablets or smartphones, the better that is for our retails business as you are suggesting and we will figure out the best way to make sure that we may get as easy as possible for customers to purchase from those devices but we think that that’s an exciting opportunity to have a world that looks like that.
In terms of your unit question, as you can probably expect, given the growth that we are seeing both in North America and in international from revenue prospective. We are seeing very good growth in units as well and so we are very pleased with the unit growth we are seeing in both segments.
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank Securities
I guess on the former question that I asked about how mobile changes the world, does that give you an advantage as you look at your recommendations capability, what you have been building in terms of that database and kind of cross-comparison of what people are buying in terms of the cross categories and products. And then I guess is it international growth that is incrementally much better on units that’s driving it. It seems like domestic has been good, but international seems to be kicking in even more so these days than ever before?
Tom Szkutak
Again your unit question is related to Mobal or it’s related to total?
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank Securities
Total.
Tom Szkutak
Again that the unit growth is very broad and so again when you see the results that we had with, at local currency basis international being up 37%, this is revenue I’m speaking as well as, North America again was a 47%, 46% on a local currency basis that you’re seeing very revenue growth. You’re also seeing very strong unit growth in those two segments. And in terms of again, in terms of Mobal, we’re going to use obviously try to make sure that we learnt as much as we can and try to serve our customers the best we can in that environment but it’s an environment that we like.
Again, the idea of having easy access from a web perspective on a wireless devices, as a world that we like, so again we’re going to do, whatever we can to make sure it’s easy for customers to get access.
Operator
We’ll go next to Steve Weinstein with Pacific Crest.
Steve Weinstein - Pacific Crest
Great, thanks. I don't know if you would be willing to disclose it, but I'm trying to get a better understanding of how much Zappos impacted the quarter. If you could at least give us a sense of what the organic growth would have been without that. But I also would love to know if there is any other impacts to the P&L. I just wanted to make sure the worldwide unit growth of 40% that is excluding Zappos, correct?
Tom Szkutak
No, the worldwide unit growth includes Zappos and the impact, someone had asked a similar question earlier. We are not breaking out Zappos results specifically as part of our total, but what I had mentioned was, if you take a worldwide results on a local currency in a growth basis and you back out Zappos and the Kindle accounting change, you see a growth rate that accelerated from Q4 and that accelerated versus what we saw in Q4 excluding exchange and excluding Zappos.
Operator
We will go next to Imran Khan with JPMorgan.
Imran Khan - JPMorgan
I have two quick modeling questions and then one more of a big picture question. In terms of modeling questions, I think on your other operating expenses/income net was $26 million, could you explain what that was, please? And secondly, fulfillment seems like it came down quite a bit at 7.4% of revenue. Is that sustainable? How should we think about that? And the long-term question is, I think the shareholder letter Jeff talked about how you launched 21 categories worldwide. Can you give us some sense how long it takes to ramp those categories, how long it takes to get to the peak margins now that we have the experience of launching many different categories over the last many, many years?
Tom Szkutak
Can you just repeat there was a part in the middle there that I missed, you said something about 7.4% I didn’t hear.
Imran Khan - JPMorgan
That is the fulfillment. Fulfillment as a percentage of revenue, I believe, was 7.4%?
Tom Szkutak
Is your question is related to that.
Imran Khan - JPMorgan
Yes, so that is down 80 basis points year over year. So I was trying to figure out if that is a one-time thing or how should we think about it? Is that sustainable, trying to figure out what is driving that leverage?
Tom Szkutak
I start with the fulfillment one first, what you are seeing there is, we saw accelerated growth and when you see accelerated growth we’re able to leverage that in our fulfillment capacity and a great way from a productivity standpoint. Also what I had mentioned was we have added capacity, but specifically in North America we haven't added in a meaningful capacity since Q3 of '08 and if you recall we were building capacity and then we had a financial disruption in the market, so we ended up having some excess capacity in Q4 of '08. We've been to leverage that capacity throughout and so that's resulting in the productivity that you are seeing. Now with the growth that we are experiencing, you should expect that we will have to add capacity overtime here to satisfy that growth.
In terms of your category question, we have learned a lot over the years, but it still takes us a number of years to get to scale when we launch new categories. One of the things we've learned over the past several years is, we need to make sure that we have great selections day one. We need to make sure that we are pricing very competitively day one. Even though we don't have necessarily the scale or the buying tools to purchase well day one and so what that means usually is that will have lower contribution profit per unit generally early on and as we learn you know those categories we get better and better at you know sourcing and make sure we have the right inventory in place and all that. So it takes a number of years before you know we get those scale in those categories and get meaningful free cash flow out of them.
Rob Eldridge
Imran, in regards to your question on what’s behind the $26 million of the operating expense. Remember that we are amortizing intangibles in that line I mean there is a number of things that go into that but it really is predominantly amortization intangible assets.
Operator
We will go next to Benjamin Schachter with Broadpoint AmTech.
Ben Schachter - Broadpoint AmTech
Well if you could discuss some initiatives around used products and particularly in EGM and what the strategy is there going forward? Another question would be discuss your private label strategy. Are there any new trends there, any new categories that we should know about? And then finally, just for the modeling, was there any meaningful impact from videogame hardware shortages this quarter?
Tom Szkutak
In terms of used products, our strategy there has been you know pretty consistent. We have a platform that is available for sellers to sell used product which is predominant use and we try make that experience as good as we can, both for the sellers and for customers so they can understand you know what the quality of the good is before making a purchase decision. We have done some private label as you mentioned and you know there is not really a lot really to speak of today about that, but again we have, do have some private label product that we sell, but you know the vast majority of the products we sell are not private label.
Operator
We will go next to Justin Post with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch
Justin Post - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch
A couple of things. First, I know your company does not like to waste money. Usually you have a revenue decline into the summer, and you ramp up your facilities and your people kind of in the third quarter. Why earlier this year? Do you feel really bullish as we go into the summer period? And then just to clarify, are you saying all of the acceleration on an ex-currency basis from 1Q versus 4Q is due to Zappos and Kindle amortization?
Tom Szkutak
On a global basis excluding exchange Kindle and the accounting change, we saw a few 100 basis points acceleration and growth so we did accelerate excluding those items. In terms of capacity we do have high growth rates right now. We have 40% unit growth, 46% revenue growth in Q1, you see the guidance for Q2 and so as you would expect with that growth rate we need to make sure we have the right amount of capacity and people on hand to serve. As part of that from a fulfillment perspective, we are growing our fulfilled by Amazon, our FDA business which also requires capacity to do so. So those are things we view as high quality problems but those are things that we certainly will have to add as we move forward as well as other areas, other parts of our business that are growing in addition to those two.
Justin Post - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch
But you said that you are investing earlier this year than normal, or is it just maybe a little bit of a catch-up to last year? How would you phrase that, would you say?
Tom Szkutak
I guess I would characterize as it is, we’re trying to make sure we, satisfy demand in our retail business and our third party business that we fulfill as well as web services businesses, so those are the things we’re trying to do and making sure that we have the right capacity on hand.
Operator
We’ll take our final question from Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse.
Spencer Wang - Credit Suisse
A question on e-books. I guess, as you and the industry move more towards the agency model for digital books, it shifts the ability to set pricing to publishers. I guess our understanding is you also have to charge sales tax, also. So it would seem that your ability to leverage low price maybe mitigated a little bit. So I was wondering if you could just talk about how you would adjust your model to differentiate Amazon versus some of the other players in the context of the other two pillars, I guess, convenience and selection that you are focused on?
Tom Szkutak
One of the things that we’re doing is we are expanding selection, pre-dramatically. When we launched two plus years ago, with Kindle we had approximately 90,000 titles. Just recently we passed over 500,000 titles and so our vision is, as we stated when we launched Kindles to have every book ever published in any language available for customers in under 60 seconds and that’s still our stated long-term goal and so we’re going to continue to add selection in support of that vision.
Operator
And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Rob Eldridge for any additional or closing remarks.

Good day and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 financial results conference. (Operator Instructions) For today’s opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Rob Eldridge. Please go ahead, sir.
 
Rob Eldridge 
Hello and welcome to our Q4 2009 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. He and I will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.
The following discussion or responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, January 28, 2010 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. 
Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K.
As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. 
During this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2008. Now I will turn the call over to Tom.

Thomas J. Szkutak
Thanks Rob. I will begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month free cash flow grew 114% to $2.92 billion. Return on invested capital was 66% up from 41%. ROIC is trailing TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. 
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 461 million shares compared with 446 million. Worldwide revenue grew 42% to $9.52 billion or 37% excluding the $354 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. 
We are grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, best selection and free shipping offers including Amazon Prime. 
Media revenue increased to $4.68 billion, up 29% or 23% excluding FX rates. 
EGM revenue increased to $4.61 billion up 60% or 54% excluding FX rates. Worldwide EGM increased to 48% of worldwide sales, up from 43%. 
Worldwide unit growth was 37%. Active customer accounts exceeded 105 million, up 19%. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 1.9 million, up 24%. Seller units were 28% of total units. 
Worldwide gross profit was $1.98 billion, up 47%. 
Now I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $1.3 billion or 14.5% of sales, down 25 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $733 million or 7.7% of revenue compared with 7.9%. 
Tech and content was $297 million or 3.1% of revenue compared with 3.5%. 
Marketing was $269 million or 2.8% of revenue, up from 2.5% in the prior year. 
Now I will talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments or stock based compensation or other operating expense line items. 
In the North America segment, revenue grew 36% to $4.96 billion. Zappos, which is included in our results beginning November 1, 2009 contributed approximately $200 million to our fourth quarter revenue.
Media revenue grew 20% to $2.1 billion. EGM revenue grew 54% to $2.66 billion, representing 54% of North America revenues, up from 48%. North America gross profit grew 50% to $1.17 billion and gross margin increased 211 basis points to 23.6%, driven by increases in other revenue, improvements in inventory management including vendor pricing and increases in 3P product sales, partially offset by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix. 
North America segment operating income increased 113% to $278 million, or 5.6% operating margin. 
In the international segment, revenue grew 49% to $4.56 billion. Revenue growth was 37%, adjusting for the $344 million year-over-year favorable impact on foreign exchange rates during the quarter. 
Media revenue grew 37% to $2.58 billion or 26% excluding FX. And EGM revenue grew 68% to $1.95 billion or 56% excluding FX. EGM now represents 43% of international revenues, up from 38%.
 
International gross profit grew 42% to $806 million, or grew 31% excluding FX, while gross margin decreased 79 basis points to 17.7%, driven by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix, partially offset by improvements in inventory management including vendor pricing and increases in 3P product sales. 
International segment operating income increased 39% to $319 million, a 7% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange rates, international segment operating income increased 25%. 
Consolidated segment operating income grew 66% to $597 million or 6.3% of revenue, up 91 basis points year over year. Excluding the $31 million favorable impact from FX rates, CSOI grew 58%. 
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 75% to $476 million, or 5% of net sales. 
Our income tax expense was $85 million in Q4, or an 18% rate for the quarter. GAAP net income was $384 million, or $0.85 per diluted share compared with $225 million and $0.52 per diluted share.
Now I will discuss full year results. Revenue grew 28% to $24.51 billion or 29% excluding the $182 million unfavorable impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates.
North America revenue grew 25% to $12.83 billion, and International grew 31% to $11.68 billion, or 33% growth excluding year over year changes in FX.
Consolidated segment operating income or CSOI grew 44% to $1.57 billion or 48% excluding $40 million of unfavorable impact from FX rates, and operating margin increased 71 basis points to 6.4%. 
GAAP operating income grew 34% to $1.13 billion or 4.6% of net sales.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.64 billion year over year to $6.37 billion. Our cash and marketable securities primarily consist of cash, government and government agency securities, AAA rated money market funds and other investment grade securities. Such amounts are recorded at fair value. 
In January 2010 our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $1 billion of our common stock, replacing our previous share repurchase program.
Inventory increased 55% to $2.17 billion and inventory turns were 12.2, unchanged from a year ago, even as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels, and introduced new product categories. 
Accounts payable increased 56% to $5.61 billion and accounts payable days increased to 68 from 62 in the prior year. 
Our 2009 capital expenditures were $373 million. 
While we are not providing CapEx guidance on today’s call, we want to remind you that we are beginning the transition to our new Seattle offices this year. We will incur incremental CapEx of approximately $100 million in 2010 in support of this multi-year project.
I will conclude my portion of today’s call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we’ve seen to date and what we believe to date to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including the high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. 
It is not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as: settling intra-company balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries; unfavorable resolution of legal matters; and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. 
Our guidance further assumes that we don’t conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.
We are prospectively adopting accounting standard update #2009-13, Revenue Recognition, Multiple Delivery Revenue Arrangements as of January 1, 2010. Sales of our Kindle e-Reader are considered arrangements with multiple elements which include the device, wireless connectivity and software upgrades. The revenue related to the device, which is a substantial portion of the total sales price, and related costs, will be recognized at the time of delivery.
Revenue for the wireless connectivity and the software upgrades will continue to be amortized over the life of the device, which remains estimated at two years. The impact of the adoption of the standard is included in the first quarter 2010 guidance.
For Q1, we expect net sales of between $6.45 billion and $7 billion, or growth of between 32% and 43%. This guidance anticipates approximately 500 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. 
GAAP operating income to be between $275 million and $365 million or growth between 13% and 50%. This includes approximately $100 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. 
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $385 million and $475 million or growth of between 20% and 48%. 
We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
Thanks. With that, Rob, let's move to questions.

Rob Eldridge
Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you remind our listeners how to initiate a question?
Question-and-Answer

Operator
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Mark Mahaney – Citi.
Mark Mahaney – Citi
Quick question. That tax rate of 18%, should we extrapolate from that going forward? Secondly, any broad comment on your ability to sell, increasingly sell, consumer staples, particularly momentum behind that Subscribe and Save program?
And then finally, could you help us quantify at all the Kindle impact? The difference in accounting, maybe by providing an adjustment for what Kindle revenue or something would have been like last year? Some way for us to parse out how much of an increase, or how much of the guidance could you speak to, to a change in the revenue recognition? Thanks a lot.
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of tax rate it was 18% for the quarter, 22% for the year. That includes certainly the reason why the change in Q4 is related to the jurisdictions that we operate in. Again, we are not providing guidance beyond 2009 for taxes.
In terms of consumer staples, it is certainly a category that we like. It is growing very nicely. Subscribers can save from an adoption standpoint, and it is working, so those are things we are going to continue to focus on, as well as other things to try to grow that particular category.
As it relates to the Kindle change, we have provided some information in the 10-K. Essentially the way you should think about guidance is certainly the change is effective 01/01/10 so it is included on our Q1 guidance, so for the units that we sell, a substantial portion of the price times those units will be reflected in our revenue. In addition to that, we have approximately $500 million of deferred revenue from shipments from last year that we amortized between 2010 and 2011. So a portion of that $500 million will also be in Q1.
Operator
Your next question comes from James Mitchell – Goldman Sachs.
James Mitchell – Goldman Sachs
Just to follow up on the previous question, you mentioned that a portion of the $500 million deferred revenue will be booked in Q1. Could you run through that, because I assume that it would be a retroactive restatement from previous quarters.
Also, when you look at the Zappos benefit to 1Q10 revenue, is it [inaudible] 4Q09 $200 million, given on the one hand you have a full three months in the quarter? But on the other hand, it is the seasonally slower quarter? Thank you.
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of the change, we are adopting it prospectively so as of 01/01 we are not restating. So again, that is reflected in our Q1 guidance.
In terms of Zappos, how to think about it, I think probably the best way to do it would be – again, we are not giving guidance on Zappos specifically, it is reflected in the guidance that we gave for Q1 – we have released certainly previous quarters so you can go back to Q1 of last year and make your own assumptions in terms of growth rate for year over year and certainly there would be a range there, but you can see that is probably the best way to think about it and look at what you would put in for Q1.
Operator
 
Your next question comes from Imran Khan – J.P. Morgan.
Imran Khan – J.P. Morgan
Thank you for taking my questions. One is housekeeping and one more of a big picture question. Housekeeping North American gross margins improved 200 basis points on a year over year basis? I am trying to understand what are some of the moving parts that are helping drive these gross margins higher, and how should we think about the swing factors in the North American gross margins.
Secondly, as we look at the media business become more digital and we see more and more new devices coming to the marketplace, could you help us understand how AMZN’s competitive position change in the marketplace? i.e. physical versus web, you have some competitive advantage but if a lot more devices are sold that you can download books electronically, how does your competitive position change?
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of your first question, North American gross margins are up a little over 200 basis points as you mentioned. A number of drivers, certainly we had a nice increase in other revenue which includes the web services business and those other agreements that go into that line item. Inventory management, we are getting better at inventory management which also flows into our operating results as well. We are getting better prices from suppliers and partners. We had good third party sales. Those are the key contributors.
Partially offsetting that were certainly lower prices during the quarter, so those are the drivers for gross margin.
In terms of how we are thinking about the digital and physical within media, we think we are positioned very nicely from a digital perspective. We have obviously some longer-standing relationships with many, many different partners around the world in those particular categories. We think we are focused on the customer and I think Kindle is certainly a good example of that. We think we’ve built a very-nice purpose-built device – excuse me, that is purpose-built for reading and we believe that readers deserve to have a dedicated device with great selection and great prices.
So those are the things we’ve worked on in the 27 months since launch and those are the things we will continue to focus on starting with the customer.
Operator
 
Your next question comes from Jeetil Patel – Deutsche Bank.
Jeetil Patel – Deutsche Bank
First of all, you’ve been in Prime in the international markets for a little over two years now, and if we go back domestically you saw a nice little acceleration in unit growth when you hit the two-year mark. Is it safe to assume that you are seeing a similar trend internationally given the growth internationally plus the unit growth acceleration?
Second question, you have got a lot of different services you’ve worked on over the years between Kindle, digital music, digital video, cloud computing and web services. Is there any sort of perspective or view that you have that maybe there is an opportunity to consolidate or integrate all of these services together in a unified platform that can be licensed or OEM’d to other companies to utilize while you manage the background behind it?
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of your first question, Prime, we are very pleased with the performance of Prime in each of the geographies and it is certainly contributing to our international growth as well as it continues to help our North American growth. So other factors that are also helping international are certainly we’ve added a number of categories; along with those categories comes a lot of selection. We’ve continue to improve our in-stock levels. Prime, as you’ve mentioned is helping and just making sure we have great prices. So getting product to customers fast is important and Prime is one of the ways that helps us do that.
In terms of your second question, I am not sure there is a lot I can help you with there. In each of those services our primary focus is that we have a great customer experience, and that is the one thing that is common in all of those and we are going to continue to focus as we have in our physical business on how do we make sure that we have an integrated experience, and those are the things that are common.
Jeetil Patel – Deutsche Bank
Do you think all those individual services can be offered as a bundled solution? 
Thomas J. Szkutak
I would hate to speculate on something like that. We are focused on what is right for customers and many of those have distinct customer sets that are different from each other and we are focused on how to make that experience great.

Your next question comes from Justin Post – Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post – Bank of America-Merrill Lynch
Two questions. First, when you look at the deferred revenues on the cash flow statement I think you recognized 444, you had that much as deferred revenues this year in the fourth quarter versus 162. My first question is, is there anything materially different besides Kindle in those two numbers?
Second thing, you say you have millions of Kindle users. Is it safe to assume that you have over 2 million now, at least?
Finally, when you think about the category roll out road map, could you give us any thoughts on where you are in that? Are you 80% of all the categories you can roll out? Or are there still a lot more opportunity? How would you frame that opportunity at this point in your life cycle? Thank you.
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of deferred revenue, there are a number of things that go into deferred revenue. Certainly Kindle has been one of those. Kindle has [inaudible] for some time as we roll that off. The other is certainly Prime, as well as a few others, but those are certainly two of the bigger items.
In terms of category roll out, hard to say in percentage terms but we have a lot of room to add additional selections. If you look at it on a worldwide basis, think about it this way: we have many new geographies that we can enter, some of which, many that we support today from an export standpoint but we could certainly roll out more geographies, so we can add category selection there.
We can add many new categories in all of our geographies, and then also we are adding a selection in categories that we’ve been in for 10 or more years, each year we continue to grow the selection of those categories. So it is one of the inputs to growth. It is one that we are very focused on and we continue to be focused on for many years to come, because there is just a lot of selection to add.
And then I think there was a third part, I apologize…
Justin Post – Bank of America-Merrill Lynch
For Kindle users, is it at least 2 million? Can you give us any thoughts on that?
Thomas J. Szkutak
Again, other than the quote I can’t really add much to that.

Your next question comes from Douglas Anmuth – Barclays Capital.
Douglas Anmuth – Barclays Capital
Thanks for taking questions. Can you talk about your thoughts on potentially opening up to the epub reader standards for the Kindle, and also provide some color on why you’ve separated the Kindle device team from the Kindle media team internally? Thanks.
Rob Eldridge 
Hi Doug, it’s Rob here. How are you doing? In terms of epub, our platform here is designed to have a seamless experience across the whole set of devices with whisper sync, and we think that’s the right customer experience for us to continue to deliver in the future.
And your second question?
Douglas Anmuth – Barclays Capital
Separating out the Kindle device team from the Kindle media team internally.
Thomas J. Szkutak

Again, we are not commenting on how we are organized, we have a great team across many geographies to figure out the best way to serve customers and beyond that we can’t comment.
Operator
 
Your next question comes from Scott Devitt - Morgan Stanley.
Scott Devitt - Morgan Stanley
Thanks for taking the question. First was related to the emergence of new hardware in the digital book business and also the emergence of potentially higher price points and how you think that your relationship with publishers could potentially evolve over time in terms of impacting the $9.99 price point?
Secondly, and again just qualitatively because I know you won’t answer this directly, but 3P mix U.S. versus International, can you give us some gauge in terms of the differences and distinctions in those areas? Thank you.
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of 3P, we are again pleased with both segments. We continue to grow nicely in our seller business and we continue to look for ways to improve that experience not only for our customers but for sellers, which is certainly another customer set that we have. One example of that is fulfill by Amazon which has certainly been helpful in terms of growing our selection from sellers and the number of sellers as well.
In terms of discussions about any of the other relationships with vendors, and this would be any category, not just the one that you mentioned, certainly any of those discussions that we would have would be between us and those particular partners. But the main focus of those discussions would always be for us, how do we make sure we can offer customers the selection they want at great low prices? So those are the things that we are always continually focused on in each of our categories and each of our geographies.
Operator
Your next question comes from Sandeep Aggarwal – Collins Stewart.
Sandeep Aggarwal – Collins Stewart
Thanks for taking my question. Tom, can you talk about the international penetration of Kindle? I know you don’t talk about the units, but maybe in terms of number of countries where the Kindle is not available? But internationally, perhaps the ratio of U.S. versus non-U.S. units sold, or maybe the growth trajectory of Kindles sold in U.S. versus International?
Thomas J. Szkutak
Sure, obviously we are not providing a lot of data. It is available in 130 countries today. We think it is a great opportunity for customers as well as for us long term, and we are continually trying to figure out ways in those geographies even better than it is today. I can’t add any more detail to that.
Operator
 
Your next question comes from Benjamin Schachter – Broadpoint AmTech.
Benjamin Schachter – Broadpoint AmTech
I just want to go back to the U.S. gross margin question. As I recall last year you talked a lot about the macro situation leading to better pricing from vendors, this year it sounds like you also got better pricing from your vendors. So any qualitative remarks on what is driving your ability to get the better vendor pricing? Is it purely volume or are there other things there?
And then just quickly, any comments on the Amazon branded products? Any update there? Thanks.
Thomas J. Szkutak
Sure. No, it is certainly the biggest factor would be volume, but it is in a few different pieces. One is you can take a look at our overall growth, which in the case of North America was up 36%, that was certainly helped by Zappos as part of that. If you take out Zappos from the number that I gave you it would be 31% growth which is still a nice acceleration from where we’ve been recently.
So that is one, just overall volume. The other is when you look at North America, some of the categories that we’re in that we’ve just started a few years ago becoming more and more meaningful, so as those become more and more meaningful good things happen. We are able to get better prices from suppliers but also they become more attractive for third-party sellers to sell on our detail pages, so it is a combination of those items that allowed us to grow gross margins in Q4, while lowering prices for customers, so it was a combination of those factors.
Operator
 
Your next question comes from Youssef Squali – Jefferies & Co. 
Youssef Squali – Jefferies & Co. 
In the press release it said something to the effect that you sell six Kindle books for every ten physical books. Can you give us that number a year ago just so we can have something to compare it to?
Second, I would like to ask the inverse of that question with regard to Apple and the operating system. Will Apple continue to support the Kindle app with their iPad?
Thomas J. Szkutak
To your second question, yes. The answer to your first question is I can’t give you that, but again, so far this year six of ten was digital versus physical where we have both editions.
Operator
 
Your last question comes from Colin Sebastien – Lazard Capital Markets.
Colin Sebastien – Lazard Capital Markets
First about your pricing strategy, if there has been any change there with regard to being a price follower or a price leader? 
Secondly, looking at the Q1 outlook if you can talk about some of the variables that might lead to year over year contraction in the CSOI margin, was that Zappos-related perhaps, or deferred revenues from Kindle or something else? 
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of pricing, no, nothing has changed. We are all about making sure we have great prices across all of our categories across all of our geographies so nothing has changed there. In terms of Q1 we have given a range that we think is appropriate and as you can see from the lower end of the range, as you described, for the upper range you see operating margins improving year over year and again, we are very positive about what we saw in Q4 as well as what we saw as we progressed throughout 2009 yet there is still a degree of uncertainty out there and so we think that is representative of the guidance that we’ve given and we think it is appropriate.
In terms of your other questions, in terms of individual breakouts of businesses, we are not providing that as part of our guidance.

Welcome to the Amazon.com third quarter 2009 financial results teleconference. (Operator Instructions) For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Rob Eldridge. Please go ahead. 
Rob Eldridge 
Hello and welcome to our Q3 2009 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. 

The following discussion or responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 22, 2009, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K.

As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.  During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this web cast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.

Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2008. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom.

Thomas J. Szkutak
Thanks Rob. I will begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12-month free cash flow grew 98% to $1.92 billion. Return on invested capital was 50% up from 32%. ROIC is trailing 12-month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter-ends. 
The combination of common stock and stock based awards outstanding was 451 million shares compared with 458 million. Worldwide revenue grew 28% to $5.45 billion or 29% excluding the $41 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We are grateful for our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, best selection and free shipping offers including Amazon Prime. 
Media revenue increased to $2.93 billion, up 17% or 18% excluding FX. EGM revenue increased to $2.36 billion up 44% or 45% excluding FX. Worldwide EGM increased to 43% of worldwide sales up from 38%. Worldwide unit growth was 32%. Active customer accounts exceeded 98 million, up 17%. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 1.8 million, up 24%. Seller units were 31% of total units. Worldwide gross profit was $1.27 billion, up 27%.  
Now I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined were $923 million or 17% of sales, down 107 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $444 million or 8.2% of revenue compared with 8.9%. Tech and content was $267 million or 4.9% of revenue compared with 5.3%. Marketing was $144 million or 2.6% of revenue, up from 2.5% in the prior year. 
Now I will talk about our segment results and consistent with the prior periods we do not allocate the segments, our stock based compensation or other operating expense income net line item. 
In the North America segment, revenue grew 23% to $2.84 billion. Media revenue grew 13% to $1.41 billion. EGM revenue grew 36% to $1.29 billion, representing 45% of North America revenues, up from 41%. This week we started shipping Kindle with U.S. and International wireless and lowered its price to $259 from $279. This newest Kindle is available to ship to customers living outside the U.S. Customers in more than 100 countries around the world and U.S. customers traveling abroad can take advantage of Kindle’s 3G wireless technology and download a title in 60 seconds or less. 
North America gross profit grew 28% to $752 million and gross margin increased 101 basis points to 26.5%, driven by increases in other revenue in 3P product sales, improvements in inventory management including vendor pricing, partially offset by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix. 
North America segment operating income increased 77% to $156 million, a 5.5% operating margin. In the international segment, revenue grew 33% to $2.61 billion. Revenue growth was 35%, adjusting for the $39 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact during the quarter.  
Media revenue grew 22% to $1.52 billion and EGM revenue grew 54% to $1.06 billion or 58% excluding FX.  EGM now represents 41% of international revenues, up from 35%.  
International gross profit grew 26% to $521 million, or grew 30% excluding FX, while gross margin decreased 108 basis points to 20%, driven by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix, partially offset by improvements in inventory management including vendor prices and increases in 3P product sales.  
International segment operating income increased 36% to $194 million, a 7.4% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, international segment operating income increased 44%.  
Consolidated segment operating income grew 52% to $350 million or 6.4% of revenue, up 101 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $10 million unfavorable impact from FX, CSOI grew 56%.  
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation and other operating expenses. GAAP operating income grew 62% to $251 million, or 4.6% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $60 million in Q3, or a 23% rate for the quarter.  GAAP net income was $199 million, or $0.45 per diluted share compared with $118 million and $0.27 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $1.68 billion year-over-year to $4 billion. Our cash and marketable securities primarily consists of cash, government and government agency securities, AAA rated money market funds and other investment grade securities.  Such amounts are recorded at fair value.  
Inventory increased 23% to $1.62 billion and inventory turns decreased to $12.1 from $12.4 a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels, and introduced new product categories.  
Accounts payable increased 50% to $3.35 billion and accounts payable days increased to 72 from 63 in the prior year. Our investment in net fixed assets increased $355 million from a year ago to $1.09 billion.  
Our Q3 capital expenditures were $103 million.  
I’ll conclude my portion of today’s call with guidance.  Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we’ve seen to date and what we believe to date to be appropriately conservative assumptions.  Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including the high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending.  It’s not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling inter-company balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on our guidance.  
Our guidance excludes the impact of Zappos, including approximately $35 million of expenses related primarily to employee compensation costs, amortization of intangibles and merger related expenses that would be recognized in the fourth quarter 2009 if the transaction closes as planned.
Guidance further assumes that we don’t conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that FX rates remain approximately where they’ve been recently.  
For Q4, we expect net sales of between $8.125 billion and $9.125 billion, or growth between 21% and 36%.  This guidance anticipates approximately 500 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. 
GAAP operating income to be between $300 million and $425 million or grow between 10% and 56%.  This includes approximately $100 million of stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.  
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expenses, to be between $400 million and $525 million or growth between 11% and 46%.  
We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
Thanks. With that, Rob, let's move to questions.
Rob Eldridge
Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you remind our listeners how to initiate a question?
Question and Answer
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from James Mitchell at Goldman Sachs.
James Mitchell – Goldman Sachs
Thank you very much for taking my question. It looks like you enjoyed very strong sequential North America revenue growth, both media and EGM, much stronger in fact than you have enjoyed in previous quarters. Could you talk about what drove that quarter-on-quarter growth in North America revenue?
Thomas J. Szkutak
Sure. If you take a look at -- if you recall from 90 days ago, we did see a nice sequential increase, but as a reminder, Q2, we had a strong -- a difficult compare from the previous year, Q2 of 2008. But even we still saw acceleration if you look at Q1 of 2009 or Q4 of 2008. And it was very broad, you know, within the media categories. In fact, all the major categories within media saw an acceleration from Q2 to Q3, so it's very broad and it was driven by a lot of the fundamentals. You know, having great low prices, certainly we had selection increases, in-stock increases during the quarter, as well as Prime is certainly having an impact. So all of those things certainly had an impact.
Also as a reminder, you know North America as we finished Q3 of last year, certainly the last few weeks of the quarter were softer, given what was going on economically. But again, we saw very strong growth in the quarter.
Operator
Your next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post – Bank of America-Merrill Lynch
Great, thank you. My question is on the margin outlook for the fourth quarter. We have heard some competitors out there are getting more aggressive with price, on books especially but other areas. Maybe if you could characterize your view on the margin environment in the fourth quarter.
And then secondly, on unearned revenue, it looked like it was up $197 million, a little less growth than in second quarter or in absolute dollars. Is that reflective at all of the Kindle, or are there other things in the unearned revenue line we should think about? Thank you.
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of your first question, you know, what we anticipate will happen, Q4 was reflective of the guidance that we gave you. It's obviously a challenging, in any Q4, to give guidance and given what's going on externally, from a macro environment standpoint, it's certainly a challenging time to do so. But we still feel -- that being said, we feel very good about what we saw in Q3; customers responding very positively, and right now we're heads down focused on making sure that we have a great customer experience during Q4. Around the world right now we're focused on making sure that we have great low prices, that we are getting our inventory, making sure that our in-stocks are where they need to be and selection on hand. You can see our inventory did increase as we -- as it has in previous Q3s and that's really getting ready for Q4. So we're optimistic and we've given a wide range, given that optimism, and we're focused on customers. So again, hard to predict what will happen.
But in terms of competitive environment, certainly it is very competitive. It's been very competitive since the day we launched and we have many different competitors in all the different categories that we operate in around the world.
Justin Post – Bank of America-Merrill Lynch
And then on unearned revenue?
Thomas J. Szkutak
Certainly there are a number of things that go into unearned revenue and certainly we have some marketing relationships. Kindle goes in there, Prime goes in there. So there are a number things going in. It can be a little bit lumpy, because of some of the things that go in, but certainly the principle pieces being, that we have certainly have talked about in the past being Kindle and Prime, are doing very well and we’re very, very pleased with the growth that we’re seeing in both of those and we’re excited with the announcement that we have related to Kindle that we can offer our newest Kindle at $259 effective today.
Operator
Your next question comes from Youssef Squali from Jefferies & Co. 
Youssef Squali – Jefferies & Co. 
Would you consider opening up Kindle to supporting other formats, considering the increasing availability of content from other providers? And related to that, is there a threshold above which you’d start actually breaking out Kindle sales for us to gauge the level of your success?
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of breaking out Kindle, certainly as you get to certain sizes, we’ve done in the past, we’ve broken out various countries and we would follow whatever is required to do so, and obviously in the results that we give we try to be as helpful as we can.
In terms of opening up Kindle, there’s not a lot I can add to that. I wouldn’t want to speculate what we might or might not do there, but what we are focused on Kindle is obviously to make sure we offer customer experience and we’re heads down focused on making sure that we do that.
Operator
Your next question comes from Douglas Anmuth from Barclays Capital.
Douglas Anmuth – Barclays Capital

Can you talk about your profitability and the margins in particular being about 60 points above the high end of your range? I’m just curious on what the biggest delta was on your results versus what you were expecting for the quarter there. And then secondly, it looks like your accounts payables days went to 72, which is a pretty significant increase. What were the key drivers in that?
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of the margin, what you really are seeing, a number of factors but certainly a principal one is you’re seeing we had very strong growth. You’re seeing very good leverage in our operating costs and if you look at our gross margin, we’re essentially flat year over year and you saw good leverage in operating costs, and really across all the key items. So we had very good leverage. Certainly when you look at our operating costs, there is a variable component and there’s also a fixed component and so the fixed is where you’re seeing the largest leverage.
In terms of AP, we did see a very big increase. That’s also reflected in the inventory that we brought in at the end of Q3, getting ready for the holidays. Keep in mind that when you compare that to last year at this time, there’s a little bit of some seasonality, if you will, because if you recall particularly in the U.S. we saw a little bit of a slow down near the end of Q3. And so when that happens and there was certainly uncertainty related to what was going on in Q4, you’re seeing probably a little less replenishment than you would see given the results that you just saw in Q3. 
So part of that is certainly just more timing related as it relates to the two types of quarters we’re dealing with. There’s also some mix of business there, as well as some better terms with suppliers.
Operator
Your next question comes from Scott Devitt from Morgan Stanley
Scott Devitt - Morgan Stanley
Understanding there’s been unique volatility in business conditions in currency, when you gave first quarter guidance it was a range of 6% to 17%, then you did 14% and when you guided the recent quarter, you gave 11% to 23% and did 28%. I was just wondering if you could comment on your visibility into 4Q, given the still wide revenue range that you’ve given and the back-end loaded nature of the quarter, and the way that it seems business improved meaningfully throughout Q3, even after accounting for the September 15th event of last year.
Thomas J. Szkutak
I think the only thing I could say is we’re giving a wide range. The range is 21% to 36% growth on a dollar basis. We have reflected what exchange rates are recently which is approximately 500 basis points of impact, which would be 16% to 21%, and that wide range reflects, as I talked about a little bit earlier on the call, that uncertainty. 
That being said, we like what we saw in Q3 and as you also mention and inherent in your question, it is a back-end loaded quarter. It is very seasonal and December is by far our largest month in terms of overall revenue, and so it is all in front of us. That is why for us right now it is a very busy time as you can probably imagine, and we are focused very heavily on how do we make that experience as good as we possibly can for customers. We try to give guidance that reflects very good growth for the quarter but a wide range, given the uncertainty. 
Operator

The next question comes from the line of  Jeetil Patel from Deutsche Bank. 
Jeetil Patel – Deutsche Bank
A couple of questions -- you have hit the two-year mark for Amazon Prime in Japan and almost in Europe. Are you seeing the same type of frequency lift you saw with Prime in the U.S. in terms of magnitude of change in behavior? Second question, on FBA, are you seeing the ramp in FBA influence frequency as a whole on the business as you look at the U.S. market as you have better in-stock on products available from you guys? 
Rob Eldridge

Consistent with what we have said, we are still very happy with the Prime programs worldwide. When we look at the international Prime programs, not only in Japan but also in Europe, we are seeing similarities in terms of subscriber growth as well as renewal rates. Across the geographies, Prime members tend to come to the site more often, shop with us more frequently and also explore more of the different stores. So you tend to see more cross-shopping. We are very, very happy with Amazon Prime across the globe. 
In terms of FBA, we think it is a win for the seller so we think it is a win for the customers. You saw in our results today that we still are seeing good growth with the FBA program here with where we are in this period of time. We are going to continue to put a lot of energy into both those programs for the benefit of our customers. 
Jeetil Patel – Deutsche Bank

Are those influencing frequency or attach rates?
Rob Eldridge 

You are talking specifically about FBA? 
Jeetil Patel – Deutsche Bank
Yes. 
Rob Eldridge 

It is -- Again, I talk to you in the context of whenever you have the opportunity to deliver product to a customer in the United States with a guaranteed 2-day delivery or even faster if people are looking for express delivery, it is a positive thing for customers.
Operator

The next question comes from the line of Gene Munster from Piper Jaffray. 
Gene Munster – Piper Jaffray
Back on the margin side, some of the things you have been changing within the business model in terms of private labels and the product adds, which conceptually carry a higher margin, is that starting to have an impact on margin or are they just too small to be adding up to anything? 
Thomas J. Szkutak
We haven’t broken out the impact of either of those two but again in terms of private label, we certainly like that selection that we have but it is still a relatively small part of our overall selection. That is certainly something you can see by just browsing our website. You can look and it is still a relatively small part of the selection. 
Gene Munster – Piper Jaffray

Is there any growth in terms of the SKUs you have for private label you can disclose? 
Thomas J. Szkutak
No, we haven’t -- you know, we aren’t breaking out any of the individual categories or also sales by vendor at all. 
Operator

The next question comes from the line of Brian Pitts from UBS. 
Brian Pitts - UBS

A question on your shipping costs -- if you look, your outbound shipping as a percentage of sales was about 6% in the quarter. That is the lowest we have seen in quite some time. Are you seeing much better shipping efficiencies or is it really a function of higher digital media sales as part of that? 
Thomas J. Szkutak
I think at the end of the day there is lots of factors that go into our shipping costs.  Part of what I think you are seeing during the quarter is we again saw good unit growth and we were able to leverage that sort of volume throughout the entire logistics chain.
Operator

Your next question comes from Heath Terry from FBR Capital Markets. 
Heath Terry – FBR Capital Markets & Co.
Great, thanks. Can you give us a sense of the traction that you are getting within the various components of Amazon Web Services? And then just to what extent that business as a whole is contributing to the margin out performance that we are seeing this quarter?
Thomas J. Szkutak
I’m sorry, Heath, I missed the first part of your question -- it was about?
Heath Terry – FBR Capital Markets & Co.
Sure -- within Amazon Web services, the individual services that are available within that, which ones are you seeing the most traction with and have the highest level of expectations for?
Thomas J. Szkutak
It’s similar to the rest of our business, we don’t discuss the specific results of the different services. But we are seeing lots of demand around EC2 and S3 and SimpleDB. Developers use these services in different ways to create their own unique applications so we have a range of enterprise customers, start ups, academic institutions who are using AWS for a diverse set of use cases and using these building blocks to create unique solutions.  I think it’s very early with AWS but we’re very encouraged by the response that we’re getting from our customer base right now and we’re going to continue to innovate on their behalf.
As I mentioned, part of the margin would certainly be part of the other revenue increase, some of the other things we talked about including marketing, Amazon enterprise services, web services, this would be larger pieces of the other.

Your next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Citi.
Mark Mahaney – Citi
Two questions please -- the fulfillment leverage, I think that 8.1% as a percentage of revenue is the lowest you’ve ever had in the third quarter, so is there something that’s sustainable there?  Could you talk about whether that’s a base to think about it?  I know there’s seasonality in that line but that seemed to strike us as a bit of an outlayer.  
Secondly, international, you’re showing this accelerating international growth without the recession. We probably would have seen it the last couple of quarters.  Have you decided from now on you’re just going to ship your way to growth internationally and you don’t need to expand beyond the countries that you are in?  I only ask because you haven’t expanded to a new international market with a base station there in about four years but you seem to be doing fine without it, so is that the strategy from now on?
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of fulfillment, the operations team has done a great job in improving our overall efficiencies and so you’re certainly seeing that reflect in our fulfillment.  One reminder as you look at fulfillment expense as a percentage of revenue versus last year, last year we had just opened up three FCs and that’s reflected in the Q3 balance of last year in terms of expenses.  
In terms of international, no, you should expect to see that we will launch new geographies over time. What you’re seeing reflected in the growth right now is some of the things I talked about earlier, but we have added a lot of selection.  We’ve added a lot of new categories over the past couple of years and because of the opportunities we have in the existing countries that we operate in. So the team has done a great job at adding many new categories, adding selection within those categories, adding selection within the categories we are already in, making sure that we have great low prices and executing operationally, as well as certainly prime is helping us internationally as well, so all of those are combining in the results that you see. 
But no, you should expect to see more selection expansion going forward within the categories we are in, as well as geographical expansion over time.

Your next question comes from James Friedland from Cowen & Company.
James Friedland - Cowen & Company
A question as long as we’re on the topic of international, the Kindle going in to international markets, in terms of getting foreign language rights, what are the hurdles to achieving that especially in your core international markets like Germany?  What are the hurdles, what might be the timing to launch foreign language titles? Thanks.
Thomas J. Szkutak
Certainly, it's an opportunity for us, and not unlike, you know, we have very good relationships with a lot of the publishers and content owners in the geographies that we operate in and certainly it's an opportunity for us over time to expand selection.
Again, keep in mind from a Kindle perspective, our long-term vision is to have every title ever printed in any language available on Kindle in less than 60 seconds. It's certainly a big goal and something the team is certainly working towards.
Operator
Your next question comes from Benjamin Schachter from Broadpoint AmTech.
Benjamin Schachter – Broadpoint AmTech
Last quarter you called out video games as impacting the quarter and I was wondering if you could update us on how that category impacted this quarter. 
And then also, given the success of the Kindle, what are the types of criteria you use to decide any other types of devices you might try to sell directly to consumers? Thanks.
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of video games, we are not breaking out any categories specifically this quarter, but what I would say is within media, we did see an acceleration in all of the key categories from Q2 to Q3. [inaudible] speculation on any other devices, I wouldn't want to speculate what we might or might not do there.
Operator
Your next question comes from Sandeep Aggarwal with Collins Stewart.
Sandeep Aggarwal – Collins Stewart
Thanks for taking my questions. Tom, can you talk about contribution from any one-time items in your media segment during the quarter, i.e. any popular gaming or books title, or maybe pre-sale of Window 7 contribution? 
And then second is on Kindle -- can you talk about the linearity over the quarter? Did the lower price help you to hit maybe the tipping point sooner?
Thomas J. Szkutak
I'm sorry, I missed the -- in your first question, you asked for any one-time items in the growth that we saw?
Sandeep Aggarwal – Collins Stewart
In the media segment.
Thomas J. Szkutak
I'm sorry, was there more to it? I missed the last part of that first question. I apologize.
Sandeep Aggarwal – Collins Stewart
That's all right, Tom. So I was -- basically I wanted to know the contribution from one-time items in your media segment during the quarter, such as pre-sale of Windows 7 or any popular gaming title, such as maybe the V-Sports Resort or any popular book titles.
Thomas J. Szkutak
Sure. We did see -- you know, it was -- we did see better releases than we've seen in previous quarters, particularly in the second half of the quarter, which is contributing to the growth that you see. But if you look at the growth that was essentially flat in Q2, to the 13% on a dollar basis of 14% on a local currency basis, the lion's share is not these-- some of the new titles that were out there, but certainly contributed to the growth rate.
Operator
Your next question comes from Imran Khan from J.P. Morgan.
Imran Khan – J.P. Morgan
Thank you for taking my questions. I have two quick housekeeping questions and one more [inaudible] question -- so in terms of the international gross margins, it seems like international gross margins are down 100 basis points on a year-over-year basis. I tried to better understand what's driving that disparate growth in the third-party business.
And secondly, user growth 17%, active user growth, can you help me understand, is it more tilted toward international or are you seeing broad-base growth?
And more of a big picture question is regarding Web services -- it seems like talking to the developers that Amazon Web services is getting a lot of critics. Can you give us some sense, like what do you think is the gating factor that still only low-single digit percentage of IT spending is Cloud computing, why it's not moving faster?
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of international gross margins, one of the things certainly we are seeing is impacting it is lower prices to customers, changes in product mix. If you look at our EGM growth in Q3, it was up 58% on a local currency basis. That compares to 48% growth last year. International media was up 22% in the quarter, up 18% versus last year. So that mix of shift towards a higher percentage of EGM is certainly impacting gross margins in the quarter. 
That, between lower prices and change in mix, was partially offset by improvements in 3P as well as vendor pricing and inventory management. So that's really what's impacting gross margins.
In terms of Web services, we are very optimistic about Web services. We have some great services that are getting some very good traction. It’s very early and the teams have done a great job in terms of executing on those services and making those reliable. There’s great pricing on those services and the team has continued to innovate in that space. So the team is very excited about it and we like what we see there.

Your next question comes from Jeffrey Lindsay from Sanford Bernstein.
Jeffrey Lindsay – Sanford Bernstein
Will it be necessary as in previous years to significantly increase staffing for the holiday season, or do you think you’re already happy with current staffing levels? And then could you give us any kind of comment on how progress is going with [Goyo] Amazon, given [Cabo’s] recent payments to have 78% of e-commerce in China? Thank you.
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of staffing, every year we supplement our teams and our FCs around the world with additional staffing and this year will be no different, and we’ve continued to add some capacity, particularly in international recently to get ready to serve our customers.
In terms of [Goyo], we’re not breaking out in terms of giving any statistics on any of the growth in each of the geographies today but in terms of how we feel about [Goyo], we think our business in China is very good. We have a very good team there. Their focus is consistent with other geographies in trying to make sure that we have good customer experience and we think that China is a great long term opportunity and the team is working very hard on behalf of customers.
Operator
Your next question comes from Spencer Wang from Credit Suisse.

Spencer Wang – Credit Suisse
I was wondering, given how much free cash flow you guys are generating, if you could just update us on your thoughts in terms of uses of cash and maybe how acquisitions fit into that, and then how you maybe think about whether to build versus buy when you think about product category expansion. Thanks.
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of use of cash, I wouldn’t speculate what we might do except for we still have an authorization for share repurchases, that there’s $900 million remaining on the authorization, so certainly that would be potentially part of our plans. 
When you think of acquisitions, we look at those opportunistically. It’s not something new. We’ve been looking at acquisitions for a number of years now and when we find ones that we like, we’ve done some to enter new geographies over time. We’ve done some where we think speed to market is important. We’ve done some where we like the team has a very specific skill set. So there are a number of different types of ones that we’ve done and there’s not much I can add to that. We will continue our focus there like we have over the past years and as there’s opportunities, we’ll certainly look at what makes sense.
Operator
Your next question comes from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer.
Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer
I wanted to focus on the book category, obviously a lot of press lately about the new pricing strategies. The question would be, as we think about our models, both from a sales and maybe even a margin perspective, near and longer term, how should we think about some of the changes that have been made in book pricing lately?
Thomas J. Szkutak
I’m sorry, could you repeat the second half of that question?

Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer
I was saying as we think about models, and particularly in sales growth, or in margins, in books, how could the recent actions on book pricing affect those numbers?
Thomas J. Szkutak
I apologize. We haven’t broken out the growth rates or the margins of the book category. It’s included, the books margins would be included in our North America gross margins for those sales in North America and the corresponding ones in international. 
I think the way you should think about any of our categories is that we operate in competitive environments and that is something that has existed since the day we opened our doors. From our perspective, we are going to continue to focus on what is right for our customers and as I have mentioned a number of times on this call, and that is in all of our categories and all of our geographies, and so those are the things that because it is important to customers. 
In terms of also, when you talk about margins, one thing we clearly do is our focus is on primary [areas] is free cash flow and free cash flow per share, and so we focus on those operating profit dollars and free cash flow dollars and not individual margins. 
Operator
And our final question comes from Aaron Kessler from Kaufman Bros. 
Aaron Kessler – Kaufman Bros. 

First, any update on Checkup by Amazon? Clearly there seems to be some resistance from some pure play competitors and maybe expanding outside of their core retail market. I’m not sure if you commented but U.S. other revenues is up about 20% sequentially. I just wanted to see if you had an explanation for the strong growth in that category. 
Thomas J. Szkutak
Checkup by Amazon is -- you know, it’s very, very early and the team is doing a good job there but it is very early and we think it is a nice opportunity and the team is executing well there but it’s -- again, it is very early for us. 
In terms of other, beyond what we have said already I don’t have a lot to add there. Certainly the pieces that roll into there are our web services business, which is getting good traction, our co-branded credit card arrangements, we have some promotional and marketing revenues, and then Amazon Enterprise Services. So those are the make-up of other and what is reflected in the growth that you are seeing there. 
We do have -- some of that revenue is promotional in nature or marketing in nature and can tend to be, as we have seen in some quarters, a little bit lumpy and so that is the only color I could add to it. 
Aaron Kessler – Kaufman Bros. 

On tax rate, any guidance for Q4? It has been jumping around somewhat this year. 
Tom Szkutak 

No. If you look at our year-to-date tax rate adjusted for any larger items would reflect our best estimate for the year at this stage. 
Rob Eldridge 

Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our IR website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

Welcome to the Amazon.com second quarter 2009 financial results teleconference. (Operator Instructions) For opening remarks I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Rob Eldridge.
Rob Eldridge
Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2009 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. As Jeff is traveling today, Tom and I will be available for Q&A.
The following discussion or responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 23, 2009, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K.
As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. 
During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this Web cast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2008. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas J. Szkutak
I will begin with comments on our financial results.
Trailing 12-month free cash flow grew 89% to $1.54 billion. Return on invested capital was 42%, up from 29%. ROI fee is trailing 12-month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. 
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 451.0 million shares compared with 446.0 million. 
Worldwide revenue grew 14% to $4.65 billion, or 20%, excluding the $227.0 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates.
Media revenue increased to $2.44 billion, up 1% or 7% excluding foreign exchange rates.
EGM revenue increased to $2.70 billion, up 35% or 41% excluding FX. Worldwide EGM increased to 45% of worldwide sales up from 38%.
Worldwide unit growth was 28%. Active customer accounts exceeded 94.0 million, up 16%.
Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 1.7 million, up 21%. Seller units were 30% of total units.
Worldwide gross profit was $1.13 billion, up 17%.
Now we will discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, technology, and content and G&A combined was $829.0 million, or 17.8% of sales, unchanged year-over-year.
Fulfillment was $389.0, or 8.4% of revenue, while tech and content was $253.0 million, or 5.5% of revenue. Marketing was $124.0 million, or 2.7% of revenue, up 23 basis points from the prior year.
Now I will talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we cannot allocate the segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense, income net line item.
In the North America segment revenue grew 13% to $2.45 billion. Media revenue was flat at $1.15 billion with declines in some categories, particularly video games and video game consoles offset by growth in books.
EGM revenue grew 29% to $1.19 billion, representing 48% of North America revenues, up from 42%.
Kindle sales continue to exceed our expectations and we reduced the price of Kindle, the number one best seller in our consumer electronics store, to $299.
North America gross profit grew 20% to $672.0 million and gross margin increased 161 basis points to 27.4%, driven by increases in third-party product sales, improvement in inventory management, including vendor pricing, partially offset by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix.
North America segment operating income increased 30% to $125.0 million, a 5.1% operating margin.
In the international segment revenue grew 16% to $2.2 billion. Revenue growth was 28% adjusted for the $221.0 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact during the quarter.
Media revenue grew 3% to $1.29 billion, or 12% excluding FX, and EGM revenue grew 45% to $882.0 million, or 60% excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates. EGM now represents 40% of international revenues, up from 32%.
International gross profit grew 13% to $461.0 million, or grew 27% excluding FX, while gross margin decreased 56 basis points to 20.9%, driven by low prices for our customers and changes in product mix, partially offset by improvements in inventory management, including vendor pricing and increases in 3-P product sales.
International segment operating income increased 20% to $179.0 million, an 8.1% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, international segment operating income increased 43%.
CSOI grew 24% to $304.0 million, or 6.5% of revenue, up 51 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $30.0 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, CSOI grew 37%.
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense income. GAAP operating income fell 27% to $159.0 million, or 3.4% of net sales. Second quarter 2009 operating income included the impact of our settlement with Toys R Us for $51.0 million, substantially all of which as expensed during the quarter. A one-time payment from Amazon.com will take place in the third quarter of 2009.
Additionally, included in the second quarter of 2008 GAAP operating income, was a $53.0 million non-cash gain recognized on the sale of our European DVD rental assets.
Our income tax expense was $39.0 million in Q2, or a 22% rate for the quarter. GAAP net income was $142.0 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, compared with $158.0 million and $0.37 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $831.0 million year-over-year to $3.21 billion. Our cash and marketable securities primarily consist of cash, government, and government agency securities, triple- A-rated money market funds, and other investment grade securities. Such amounts are recorded at fair value.
Inventory increased 20% to $1.32 billion and inventory turns decreased to 12.4 from 13 a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels, and introduced new product categories.
Accounts payable increased 28% to $2.51 billion and accounts payable days increased to 65 from 58 in the prior year.
Our investment in net fixed assets increased $330.0 million from a year ago to $981.0 million. Our Q2 2009 capital expenditures was $78.0 million.
Yesterday we announced the acquisition of Zappos. Zappos is a customer-focused company. We see great opportunities for both companies to learn from each other and create even better experiences for our customers.
I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the trends that we've seen today and we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions.
Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending.
It's not possible to accurately predict and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we have described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance.
Our guidance excludes Zappos' financial results and assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q3 we expect net sales of between $4.75 billion and $5.25 billion, a growth of between 11% and 23%. This guidance anticipates approximately 150 basis point of negative impact from foreign exchange rates.
GAAP operating income to be between $120.0 million and $210.0 million, or between 22% decline and 36% growth. This includes approximately $95.0 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $250.0 million and $305.0 million, or between 7% decline and 32% growth.
We anticipate our free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to our operating profit growth rate over time with some variability, including some changes in working capital and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection, and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
With that, let's move to questions.
Question-and-Answer Session

Operator
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Mark Mahaney - Citi.
Mark Mahaney - Citi
I would like to ask about North America trends, particularly gross margins and media sales, and to what extent there's a link there. Last quarter you had a pretty positive gross margin trend. You repeated this quarter. But last quarter it seemed to be because of some unusual access to inventory. Was that effect still in place in the second quarter, or is there something going on in terms of the mix shift within media sales towards digital products that's really boosting those gross margins?
Thomas J. Szkutak
I'll start with the gross margin question. We saw in North America, and in international, we saw very solid 3-P product sales so 3-P is certainly impacting margins. We had very execution on a lot of other areas, including inventory management. We had very good pricing with our suppliers, which was offset partially, certainly, by lower prices for our customers, as well as product mix.
So that's really what is driving the gross margins.
In terms of the North America media growth, we saw, and just as a reminder, as I mentioned on the last call, we had very strong revenue growth Q2 of last year, which includes, if you look at it versus any other quarter over the past several quarters, it's our strongest quarter, including the growth that we saw in North America media which was up 25%.
And we had some declines in some categories, particularly video games and consoles. Video games and consoles were very, very strong last year and we had both console growth and video games themselves being strong growth. Three of our four best releases of last year were released during Q2, including wii fit. And so that was included in our Q2 last year and was driving the growth last year and we're overlapping that. And what you're really seeing is an industry slowdown in video games and consoles. 
And then we had books growth offsetting that decrease. So those are the factors that were included in there. 
And just another note. On the video games, even though we saw a decline, we're actually very happy with that category. We have added a lot of selections since last year. Our in-stock levels have improved dramatically from last year and there's a number of other things that the team has done to make that customer experience even better. So we are very pleased with the customer experience we're providing there and what we're seeing is an industry slowdown, which we saw the effect of that in our growth rates.
Operator
Your next question comes from Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank.
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank
As you look at fulfillment by Amazon, can you talk a little bit more about the impact you're seeing from FBA on the businesses in the form of just margin contribution. Is it in the form of unit growth or just a pickup in customer growth. A little bit more on how FBA so far is influencing the businesses or effecting the business.
Second, if you look at Prime internationally, is Prime internationally helping to drive the same behavior trends by region in the U.K., German and Japanese markets as you rolled it out and you've been in there for about a year and a half to two years now.
Thomas J. Szkutak
Those two programs, specifically, we're extremely pleased with. Prime, on a global basis, is doing very well and in international we're seeing very similar trends to what we saw when we launched in the U.S. It's been very successful for us. When you look at our international growth rate up 28% year-over-year on a local currency basis, and that's with, actually if you look compared to Q2 you saw a 28% growth rate as well in Q2 but we had a favorable comparison with the Easter holiday and an unfavorable comparison in Q2. So we had very strong growth rate and certainly Prime is helping that growth rate.
In terms of FBA, there's not a lot in terms of specifics from a margin standpoint I can provide today. 
But Prime is growing very well and it's certainly impacting our third-party growth and our third-party growth, from a units perspective, is 30% as percentage of total units, which was up by year-over-year, again, in Q2. So we're pleased with the growth rate and certainly FBA is contributing to that.
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank
Is the biggest influence on units or customers? Customer adds.
Thomas J. Szkutak
There's not a lot I can add to that. I apologize.
Operator
Your next question comes from Mary Meeker and Scott Devitt - Morgan Stanley.
Mary Meeker - Morgan Stanley
To extend on Mark Mahaney's question a little bit, you said in effect you're not really a slowdown in your media business from any digital transitions that are taking place in music or video?
And another question, is you EGM business is doing extremely well, can you correlate any of the things that are going on with digital media transitions with upticks in your products that play those products, if you will?
And then on mobile, and question for Jeff, we're seeing tremendous e-commerce momentum in other parts of the world and we're starting to see it in the U.S. You have a great app for Amazon on the iPhone and you have a great Kindle app, you have a great Stanza app. Is it your view that mobile can be a material portion of Amazon's revenue in the next few years?
Thomas J. Szkutak
I'll take the media one first. Certainly there's, industry, there's some certainly slowness in some of the media categories. And we're seeing some of that slowness reflected in the North America results that you see. But in terms of what's happened recently, from a trend standpoint, it's clearly the challenging pair that we had versus last year, as well as the video games impact that I mentioned.
In terms of digital, it's still very early, and we're very pleased with what we're seeing in terms of growth of our various digital products that we offer, techs, video and music. But it's still very early, and we're seeing very good unit growth there and we're very pleased with what we see there.
From an EGM perspective, there's not a lot I can give you in terms of the individual growth rates of some of those items that you mentioned, but we're seeing very good broad-based growth within EGM. We did see some slowness to some of the higher selling priced items but outside of that we're very pleased with what we're seeing.
Overall unit growth globally remains very strong so we're very pleased with that.
In terms of mobile, it's a great question. And I apologize, Jeff is not on the call today. He's traveling and just from a scheduling standpoint it didn't work. But again, we certainly think that mobile is an opportunity. As you mentioned, there are a number of applications that we have. We are going to continue to innovate in that space and it's difficult to say how big that could be over time but it's certainly something that we're excited about and we are investing in.
Scott Devitt - Morgan Stanley
The operating margin guidance that you gave, the midpoint was 5.2% and this quarter, in the second quarter, the midpoint of your guidance was 5.3%. You did 6.5%, which was the highest operating margin since the third quarter of 2005, so I understand there's some one-time dynamics going on in the industry right now, but you didn't have great visibility to that over performance in Q2 and I was just wondering if you could speak a little bit to the conservatism in the midpoint of your operating income in Q3.
Thomas J. Szkutak
We gave guidance of 215 to 305 from a CSOI perspective, which is implied operating margin of 4.5% to 5.8%, so from the upper end of the guidance, at 5.8%, that's about 40 basis points above last year. And so, again, we think that reflects the right range for the quarter.
One thing to keep in mind, though, is as you look at Q2 to Q3, those numbers that we were just talking about were the absolute and then comparing them year-over-year, when you look at it sequentially from Q2 to Q3, keep in mind that Q3 historically is a quarter that we're getting ready for our largest seasonal quarter, Q4, and so there are certainly expenses that are included in that quarter to get ready for, for example, adding additional capacity, and certainly with the growth that we've seen, particularly in international, we are adding capacity to get ready for Q4. So that's reflected in our Q3 guidance and it's typical at this time to be doing that based on getting ready for Q4.
So again, that's one of the reasons why you saw a decline last year as well.
Operator
Your next question comes from James Mitchell – Goldman Sachs.
James Mitchell – Goldman Sachs
Looks like your sales and marketing costs pick up a little bit as a center of revenue by quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Could you talk about what's going on behind that.
And also if you could discuss your effective tax rate.
Thomas J. Szkutak
From a marketing perspective it was 2.7% of revenue. The range over the past several quarters has been in the low 2%'s, 2.2% to 2.7% I believe. So it was a little bit on the higher end of the range. But again, I wouldn't  read too much into that. It's just based on the opportunities we saw within the quarter, looking at new customer acquisitions. So gain, I don't think there's anything really meaningful to talk about there. 
In terms of effective tax rate, the way I'm thinking about is if you look at the effective tax rate for the half, it's a little bit over 25%. Keep in mind that we had a one-time item, Toys R Us, which was $51.0 million. Substantially all of that would be in that number, which is tax effected at the U.S. tax rate. So that's bringing it down a bit. It's a one-time event so if you back that out the tax rate would be a little bit higher than that, which would reflect essentially the projection for the year.

Imran Khan – J.P. Morgan
I think in the past you talked about how you are not seeing cannibalization from Kindle. I think you talked about like how average Kindle owners are buying 1.8 books. Can you give us an update on that number, what kind of trend you are seeing now that you have a larger Kindle owner.
And secondly, I think you talked about that you are seeing healthy growth in the third-party and international business, but international gross profit margins I believe was down on a year-over-year basis, roughly 50 basis points. Could you give us some color to understand why.

Thomas J. Szkutak
I'll take the third-party first, for international. What you're seeing there is we did actually see very good third-party growth in international. One thing to keep in mind is when you look at our overall growth rates in international, we saw extremely strong EGM growth accelerated to 60% year-over-year on a local currency basis. Many of those categories, if you look back over the past few years, we've launched a number of new categories in EGM in international. And when we launch new categories oftentimes the gross margins are lower, again, as we're starting out in those categories.
So that's reflecting the product mix. But if you look at our overall international gross margins, we certainly saw strong third-party growth, very good vendor management, very good inventory management. But certainly partially offset by the mix that I'm talking about as well as lower prices for customers.
In terms of the Kindle units, we're not doing any updates in terms of the units, in terms of specific numbers today, but we're seeing very, very good growth and we are extremely happy with the growth that we're seeing there and it's exceeding our expectations.

Your next question comes from Gene Munster – Piper Jaffray.
Gene Munster – Piper Jaffray
There's been a lot of talk about the tax rate and some third-party affiliates and the impact and some of the jockeying around where taxes are ultimately going in terms of sales tax. Can you give us how, just generally, you think about the sales tax question over the next several years.
Thomas J. Szkutak
It's one of these where we've been working for quite a few years with the states on the streamline sales tax act. Beyond that it's really hard to comment on what will happen going forward.
Rob Eldridge
It's important to remember that more than 50% of our business is conducted in areas where consumption tax, the VAT tax through the equivalent of sales tax are taking place are in international geographies. And we now collect sales taxes in five states in the United States. So we have very strong businesses in our international business as you can see from today's results.
Gene Munster – Piper Jaffray
So do you think ultimately that sales tax will be part of as 100% of sales in the next five years, say?
Thomas J. Szkutak
We can't speculate what will happen going forward.

Your next question comes from Justin Post – Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post – Merrill Lynch
On the media sales decline, when you think longer term, do you think you might see some pressure on revenues but the overall gross margins per unit going to hang in there because of digitization and could you actually see a margin improvement offset lower prices for insales.
And tech and content looks like it ticked up $24.0 million quarter-over-quarter. I wondered if you had any comments you could share with us on where you're allocating that money.
Thomas J. Szkutak
The way I think about the gross margins for our digital business is if you look at our overall digital business, it's very early. Think of it that we're investing, in the investing mode. And over time we think we can get very good returns for shareholders. And we think that there's a lot of room for us and content owners and publishers to do well there. And we think that we will get good returns over time.
In terms of tech and content, there are a number of things that are going in there. You can see from our employment numbers that the growth is approximately 14% year-over-year. It slowed from past quarters but we did still see a sequential increase of about 400 people. Some of those people are certainly going to tech and content, investing in areas like digital and Web services and other areas, which are certainly reflected in the tech and content costs.

Your next question comes from Douglas Anmuth – Barclays Capital.
Douglas Anmuth – Barclays Capital
Can you comment on the unearned revenues line, and in particular it looks like you've had a very good consistent trend there over the last several quarters, which I believe is probably fueled by Prime and the Kindle and you said that you're pretty comfortable with where both of those products are, but basically we're seeing from Q1 to Q2 a flat number in unearned revenue, so if you could provide some clarity on that I would appreciate it.
Thomas J. Szkutak
There are a number of things that go in there, including the items that you mentioned. You know, we do amortize the sale of Kindles over two years in the month following the sale, we are amortizing the Prime subscriptions. There's also other partner relationship revenues that go into that online that do some amortization and beyond that it does bounce around a bit as you can see from the trend, but beyond that there's not a lot I can add from a color perspective.
Douglas Anmuth – Barclays Capital
You mentioned earlier that Prime growth was pretty good. Is there any reason to think that there's any slowdown here in terms of new members coming on board?
Thomas J. Szkutak
No, in fact Prime growth is very strong and obviously, from our other discussions, Kindle growth is very strong. So, no, we're seeing strong growth in both areas.

Your next question comes from Youssef Squali – Jefferies & Company.
Youssef Squali – Jefferies & Company
You have lowered prices on Kindle, how should we be thinking about the driving force there? Did you get enough cost scale to still keep margins relatively unchanged or did you lower price to just increase penetration.
And secondarily, on the affiliate question, as you've pulled back out of certain states, I think North Carolina, Rhode Island, and a few others, are there affiliates in other states or are you moving some of that money to other ROI channels, like search, etc. And which one has better ROI?
Thomas J. Szkutak
We use a number of different channels on the marketing side and we are just looking at what's the most effective way to make that spend and where do we think it drives incremental value to shareholders over time. And so that's not something new. There's no change there, from that perspective. And we use a number of different channels from a paid channel perspective. We also have our associates' channel as well, so there's not a lot new there from that perspective.
And then in terms of Kindle, we certainly are getting better economies and given the growth on Kindle devices and we think that that's an appropriate price for customers and we think that it's certainly, given the growth that we're seeing.

Your next question comes from Jeffrey Lindsay – Sanford Bernstein.
Jeffrey Lindsay – Sanford Bernstein
Could you give us any sense of whether Zappos is going to be dilutive or accretive to earnings? And could you give us a sense of the post-merger integration planning for that acquisition and how we should think about it going forward, particularly if it is going to be dilutive to earnings.
And second, could you tell us if you have any plans to take Kindle overseas?
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of Zappos, we are extremely pleased with the announcement that we made yesterday and we are not discussing the dilutive or accretive nature of Zappos. I guess the way you should think about it is this. They had approximately $635.0 million worth of revenue last year. They had a small profit. And that would certainly be before any of the acquisition costs, which include intangible amortization as well as stock-based compensation, which would be post-acquisition.
But in terms of integration, the way you should think about it is it's going to be a stand-alone business. We are very, very excited about the value that they bring to customers. It's very unique. We're very excited about helping that team build the brand and we think it's a unique brand and culture and it will be a great fit with Amazon. We think that it's a great way to grown our overall shoe and apparel business. And so we're very excited about it and we've got a great overall team, a great leadership team, and we were extremely happy to be able to make the announcement yesterday.
In terms of Kindle international, it's certainly an opportunity. Customers have certainly expressed an interest and we have a long-standing practice of not talking about what we might do, but certainly it's clearly an opportunity.
Operator
Your next question comes from Spencer Wang – Credit Suisse.
Spencer Wang – Credit Suisse
Could you talk a little bit more about just the strategic rationale behind Zappos and leaving it as an independent brand and company is a little bit of a department, I think, in terms of how you've historically grown your business under the Amazon brand.
And secondarily, as part of that, even though it's going to be an independent unit within Amazon, are there any cost savings that we should be expecting, maybe from a fulfillment perspective?
Thomas J. Szkutak
Actually the way we're thinking about it is this. We have Zappos and 6PM which will join us. We have ShopUp, we have Endless, and we certainly have Amazon.com, all selling in soft lines. Shoes and apparel. And so we're very excited to have all those Web sites with—if you take a look at those Web sites, they have many different brands, they have different customers, they have a different customer experience associated with each of them. So we're very excited to have all those.
And from our standpoint, we're looking to learn from each other and we think that those categories are very interesting and we think there's a lot of growth opportunity and that's why we're doing that.
So this is not an acquisition that we're talking about, you mentioned synergies. Certainly we'll be smart about it. If there are fulfillment centers that they have, if they have additional space, we'll certainly look to use that or if we have additional space that Zappos can use we certainly will look at those opportunities, but this is not about synergies, this about growing in categories that we think are very interesting and so we're very excited about it.
I would also that this really isn't that much of a departure at all, or is not a departure at all. We've done a number of acquisitions over time. ShopUp, as I mentioned is one of those, is an acquisition that we did about three years that's in the same similar category. It's certainly in the soft lines. It's more of a fashion for women's apparel and shoes Web site and accessories. 
And we've also done a number of acquisitions as we look at some of our country launches, the last one was Joyo.com was our launch in China. So again, we've done a number of these.
Our strategy as it relates to acquisitions hasn't changed. It's the same it's been for several years now. We start with a great fit and we were really pleased to be able to make the announcement yesterday.

Sandeep Aggarwal – Collins Stewart
As e-Bay continues to transform its marketplace, what does that mean for Amazon? I know you already talked about Prime membership doing very well, but are you seeing signs of weakness in the new enrollment of Prime membership or any visible changes in the growth of third-party merchant enrollment?
Thomas J. Szkutak
We have launched a new practice of not talking about other companies, but in terms of our seller business, we had our, as I mentioned, third party units were 30% of total units, which is up over last year. Our sellers grew 21%, which is the fastest growth rate we've seen. In Q2 it was the fastest growth rate we've seen in many quarters. And our seller team has continued to focus on how to make that customer experience for our sellers as good as it possibly can be. 
FBA is an example of that. It's a great example where we provide services for sellers. It's great for customers because they get to get sellers use of our multi-no fulfillment network which allows them to get shipments using our super-saver shipping and Prime programs.
So again, our seller team is continuously focused on trying to make that experience better and that’s reflected in the metrics that you saw today that I mentioned, as well as the gross profit growth that we mentioned earlier as well.

Thomas J. Szkutak
We experimented in a number of different areas and we do have a small amount of private label product. I don't think there is a lot to talk to, but again, we are certainly doing some and we'll see what traction we get there. 
And the used video games, that's certainly one of the things, when you look at our total customer experience with video games, the team, as I mentioned, has done a great job of improving the customer experience over the past few years and that's just another example of one of the things that they've done.

Welcome to the Amazon.com first quarter 2009 financial results teleconference. (Operator Instructions) For opening remarks I will now turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Rob Eldridge.
Rob Eldridge
Hello and welcome to our Q1 '09 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. Jeff Bezos, our founder and Tom will both be available for Q&A.
The following discussion or responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 23, 2009 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially.
Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K.
As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this web cast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2008. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom.
Tom Szkutak
I'll begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12 month free cash flow grew 82% to $1.43 billion. Return on invested capital was 41%, up from 32%. ROIC is trailing 12 month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long term debt over five quarter ends.
The combination of common stock and stock based awards outstanding was 447 million shares compared with 435 million. Worldwide revenue grew 18% to $4.89 billion or 25% excluding the $268 million unfavorable impact of year over year changes in foreign exchange rates.
Media revenue increased to $2.72 billion, up 7% or 13% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $2.05 billion, up 38% or 46% excluding FX. World wide EGM increased to 42% of worldwide sales up from 26%.
Worldwide unit growth was 30%. Active customer count exceeded 91 million, up 16%. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 1.6 million, up 19%. Seller units were 32% of total units versus 30%. Worldwide gross profit was $1.15 billion, up 20%. 
Now we'll discuss operating expense excluding stock based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $826 million or 16.9% of sales, unchanged, year over year.
Fulfillment was $407 million or 8.3% of revenue while tech and content was $239 million or 4.9% of revenue. Both were unchanged from the prior year. Marketing was $124 million or 2.5% of revenue, up 11 basis points from the prior year.
Now I'll talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or stock based compensation or the other operating expense income net line item.
In the North America segment, revenue grew 21% to $2.58 million. Media revenue grew 8% to $1.31 million. EGM grew 42% to $1.17 billion representing 45% of North America revenues up from 39%.
North American gross profit grew 22% to $694 million and gross margin increased 18 basis points to 26.9% driven by improvements in inventory management including vendor pricing and the increase in 3P product sales, partially offset by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix. North America segment operating income increased 15% to $150 million, a 5.8% operating margin.
In the international segment, revenue grew 15% to $2.31 billion. Revenue growth was 28% adjusting for the $258 million year over year unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates during the quarter.
Media revenue grew 6% to $1.42 billion or 17% excluding FX and EGM revenue grew 44% to $874 million or 50% excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates. EGM now represents 38% of international revenues, up from 33%.
International gross profit grew 17% to $454 million or grew 33% excluding foreign exchange rates while gross margin increased 36 basis points to 19.6% driven by improvements in inventory management including vendor pricing and increases in 3P product sales partially offset by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix.
International segment operating income increased 34% to $172 million, a 7.4% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from FX, international segment operating income increased 63%.
CSOI grew 25% to $322 million or 6.6% of revenue, up 33 basis points year over year. Excluding the $32 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, CSUY grew 37%. Unlike CSOY, our GAAP operating income includes stock based compensation expense and other operating expense/income. GAAP operating income grew 23% to $244 million or 5% of net sales. 
Our income tax expense was $69 million in Q1 or a 28% rate for the quarter. GAAP net income was $177 million or $0.41 per diluted share compared with $143 million and $0.34 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $579 million year over year to $2.73 billion. Our cash and marketable securities primarily consists of cash, government and government agency securities triple A money market funds and other investment grade securities. Such amounts are recorded at fair value.
During the quarter we redeemed the remaining 240 million Euros, $319 million based on the Euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate at date of redemption in principal of our 6.875% peaks.
Inventory increased 18% to $1.27 billion and inventory turns were 12.5 down half a turn from the prior year as we expanded selection and improved in stock levels and introduced new product categories.
Accounts payable increased 28% to $2.3 billion and accounts payable days increased to 57 from 53 in the prior year. Our investment in net fixed assets increased $295 million from a year ago to $889 million. Our Q1 2009 capital expenditures were $55 million.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions.
Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors including the high level of uncertainties on exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling inter company balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have material affect on guidance.
Our guidance assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q2, we expect net sales between $4.3 billion and $4.75 billion on growth between 6% and 17%. This guidance anticipates approximately 700 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be between $110 million and $190 million or a decline between 49% and 12%. 
The second quarter of 2008 results include a $53 million non cash gain recognized from the sale of the company's European DVD assets. This includes approximately $90 million for stock based compensation, amortization of intangible assets. 
We anticipated consolidate segment operating income which excludes stock based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $200 million and $280 million or between 18% decline and 14% growth. 
We anticipate our free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to our operating profit growth rate over time with some variability including some changes in working capital and excess tax benefits from stock based compensation.
We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
Thanks, and with that, let's move to questions.
Question-and-Answer
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Douglas Anmuth – Barclays Capital.
Douglas Anmuth – Barclays Capital
Can you talk a little bit more about the Q2 guidance and in particular is there something that you're seeing early in the quarter that's making the outlook look a little bit lower than we would have expected versus the 1Q numbers particularly on the margin side?
Tom Szkutak
Our guidance from a revenue standpoint is growth of 6% to 17%. That's on a dollar basis, on a local currency basis that works out to be 13% to 24%. A few things to keep in mind; one, last year Q2 was our strongest growth quarter so if you take a look at the splits by quarter, last year we had 41% growth rate in Q2 or 35% growth rate on a local currency basis. We're overlapping that growth rate in the strongest quarter.
The other thing to keep in mind on the top line as well, smaller impacts, but certainly Easter was in Q1 last year last year and Q2 this year, so we had that benefit in Q1 and will be overlapping that in Q2. Also, as I mentioned from an exchange standpoint, the 700 basis points is more than you saw in Q1, so again those are the impacts on the top line.
So that's why the high end of the range works out to be 24% which is a little bit lower than we came in for Q1. So that translates down into a lower operating income. The other thing to keep in mind too is as you look at our Q2, seasonally, Q2 is our lowest quarter from a revenue perspective which means with that top line you get a little bit less leverage, particularly the fixed operating costs. So that's reflected in the guidance.
Operator
Your next question comes from James Mitchell – Goldman Sachs.
James Mitchell – Goldman Sachs
The question is about improvements in gross margin year on year in the first quarter. Were there any unusual gross margin influences other than our old friends inventory management, product mix, lower prices?

Tom Szkutak
Those are the big piece of inventory management. We worked well with vendors in terms of getting vendor savings. An example would be something that we've been working on for a number of quarters but certainly working with them to ship when they have shipments, to ship in bulk to the nearest fulfillment center.
The benefit to that is a way to share some of those savings for them shipping to the closest facility and then we get to optimize taking that larger bulk shipment and optimizing that in our network. But certainly inventory vendor management savings and also third party growth were certainly key factors and those were partially offset by lower prices to customers.
Question
Were digital sales an impact or not?

Jeffrey Bezos
Digital sales, are you referring to Kindle sales or all digital? Digital is certainly part of the numbers. The key thing to keep in mind as you think about Kindle specifically from a device standpoint, we recognize that in the month following shipment over a two year period. We amortize that over a two year period.
Operator
Your next question comes from Jeetil Patel – Deutsche Bank.
Jeetil Patel – Deutsche Bank
It's probably hard to break out but maybe a qualitative view; I'm curious how much of your core infrastructure that you've been building the last couple of years is being redeployed in other business initiatives such as FPA and AWS that are maybe contributing to the operating profit line. Is there any way to quantify that what the contribution looks like to CSOI at the end of the day some of your newer initiatives in terms of leverage the fixed assets and costs that you've built out over the years.
Second question is can you characterize how much down sizing and retrenching that online and offline that retailers are doing out there in the landscape is impacting your business positively or in general as it relates as you go after customers or consumers as well as just talking to your suppliers.
Jeffrey Bezos
The first part of your question, just to talk about how we think about the overall infrastructure both from a operations as well as infrastructure capacity standpoint, the retail part of our business we plan for peak and so when you think about fulfillment capacity, we're certainly planning for peak which is in December.
Our infrastructure supports our retail business. We also plan for peak as well, so some of the things that you're seeing with FBA as well as web services, we're not looking at it as a way to use our existing infrastructure. We're looking at them as separately standing businesses and we look at the economics that way as well.
Could you repeat the second part of your question?
Jeetil Patel – Deutsche Bank
Just trying to understand online and offline retailers shrink their business growth spending out there. How much of an impact is that having or opportunity is that as you go after customers as well as go after better supplier terms out there?
Jeffrey Bezos
I apologize. I don't think I can help you much with that one. I would just answer the first one, we use the same, for example fulfillment by Amazon inventory is co-mingled with our Amazon owned inventory in the same fulfillment center. So in that respect we're leveraging those fixed investment, but there's not excess capacity that we can, we're building new capacity both for Amazon owned inventory and new capacity for FDA, but it is comingled inventory. 
Same thing for web services. When you look at our data centers, the Amazon retail services and web services that we offer through infrastructure computing like EC2 and S3, those are co-mingled in the same data centers as well.
Operator
Your next question comes from Mark Mahaney – Citi.
Mark Mahaney – Citi
Jeff, in your shareholder letter you referred to Mooda or waste, the Japanese word for waste and you talked about being able to, seeing it in a lot of different places and a lot of potential. Could you maybe bring it down to financial terms for us and where do you think you have your best opportunity to get at that waste and where we would see it maybe show up or are we already seeing it in terms of some of those CapEx efficiencies? CapEx spending seems to be nicely contained. 
And then secondly on marketing spend, is there any particular reason why you're not seeing a little bit more efficiency in marketing spend given what seems to be pretty clear deflationary trends in online display or search advertising?
Jeffrey Bezos
On the Mooda point, this is very encouraging for me and very energizing for me that every where we look and every team here looks. When we look we find that we are doing every operation that we do in some optimal way. So we've gotten better every year but we still have a lot of progress that we can make. And that's encouraging because it means that we can get variable, we believe we can get variable and fixed productivity for a long time to come. So that's the opportunity. 
I don't know how to quantify that for you. Every time we go through our planning process we do set top down targets for variable and fixed productivity and we try to work towards those to make sure that we're being frugal and efficient so that we can have a cost structure that supports the customer experience that we want to have which is have the lowest prices.
So that's something that we take very seriously and as I said, it's very, very energizing for me to see how much opportunity there is there.

Your next question comes from Justin Post – Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post – Merrill Lynch
Some people measure Google's paid clicks versus revenues as a measure of the recession impact. When I look at your revenues versus your units, 30% units, 25% revenues, does that 5% maybe relate to ASP's or is there a mix issue or shift going on? Your shipping revenue was down 1% year over year. Does that have any indication on prime adoption and then the other revenue in the U.S., the gross there, were there some interesting things going on last year that maybe have stopped and can we read anything into your web services adoption based on that number?
Jeffrey Bezos
From a mix standpoint, the one thing that we are seeing certainly is higher priced items are still growing but certainly not growing as much as they were a few quarters ago. So that's one of the impacts that you're seeing. 
Keep in mind when you look at our business, given the selection that we have in the categories that we're in, you do see certainly some variation by quarter in terms of the mix just because of the sheer amount of the selection that we have.
In terms of the shipping revenue, there's no question that we're seeing a good adoption of prime and certainly free shipping and that's certainly impacting that revenue line item. And that's a trend that you've been seeing back to our prior quarters. That's something that you've been seeing for awhile.
In terms of your last portion of the revenues, there's a number of things that go in that line item and as we've talked about in previous calls it can tend to be a little lumpy from quarter to quarter. But again, there's a large number of things that go in there and so as we've described in other quarters.

Your next question comes from Scott Devitt – Morgan Stanley.
Scott Devitt – Morgan Stanley
I wanted to touch on vendor pricing if I could and ask it a different way. I was wondering if you're seeing any significant differences by category, possibly in areas where there's more significant retail disruption, and then also if you could comment on the sustainability of these vendor pricing improvements in all economic environments. You mentioned getting product to different fulfillment centers. That seems sustainable. I'm interested as well if there's vendor pricing that is just driven by the general disruption in the channel and whether the relevance on the business model can sustain that as the economy improves.
Thomas Szkutak
There's not a lot of help on the vendor pricing side. We continue to work with our partners in all of the categories that we're in geographically. Certainly the way you should think about it is we think that there's room over time to work with our partners to get better prices over the long term. Certainly the categories that we've been in the longest, there are still opportunities, but when you think about magnitude in terms of basis points, I would think t here would be more opportunity in the categories that we've been in the shortest amount of time. That's the way I would think about it.
In terms of what it could look like going forward, we certainly had healthy amount of savings in Q1 as reflected in the gross margins that you see and what we believe is certainly reflected in our Q2 guidance, but we'll continue to work over certainly a long period of time to try to get better, work better with suppliers to get better savings.
Operator
Your next question comes from Jeffrey Lindsay – Sanford Bernstein.
Jeffrey Lindsay – Sanford Bernstein
Did you have a specific push on fulfillment by Amazon or was that demand driven? And could you give us an indication about margins on that business and where you're booking it exactly. Is it all going into other or is it spread across the product categories?
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of FBA this is something that we've been doing for not long but again over the last several quarters and it's continued to build. I wouldn't call it any specific push. It's certainly something that we're offering to sellers. We think it's a very good experience for sellers so that they can take advantage of our multi-net fulfillment network in the U.S. and our fulfillment networks outside of the U.S. So we think that that's a great opportunity.
It comes in a number of different forms in terms of the revenue. Certainly the third party revenue that you see would come in the individual categories which is certainly the largest piece, and obviously we're recording the operating expense associated with those fulfillment services in our fulfillment line item.
Jeffrey Bezos
I'll add to that just to say that one of the things that's driving the uptake of fulfillment by Amazon is that sellers have the opportunity to drive up their sales when they switch to fulfillment by Amazon in large part because of the interaction between fulfillment by Amazon and Amazon Prime.
So as soon as a seller switches to using fulfillment by Amazon, all of their products become eligible for Amazon Prime just as if they were Amazon owned items. So the interaction between those two programs is driving sales for sellers and that is something of course that sellers want. 
That's in large part what is driving the uptake of fulfillment by Amazon.

Your next question comes from Spencer Wang – Credit Suisse.
Spencer Wang – Credit Suisse
I was wondering about the media line. That's been decelerating. Is there anything, I know FX was impacted by the international, was there anything going on there beyond just the category. And then on a related matter is media as a category as you transition to digital, could you maybe talk a little bit about Amazon DOD and how you plan on differentiating that going forward?
Jeffrey Bezos
If you take a look at our international media and our media growth in general, we saw North America, we saw an 8% growth which is consistent with what we saw in Q4. Q4 was just slightly less that 7% and then in international on a local currency basis, it was 17% which was down a little bit from Q3. It was 22%.
And again, you saw our total revenue, if you go back to Q4 for international, was 31% on a local currency basis, so it was really consistent with what we saw in the first three quarters of the year. We saw that dip a little bit and we believe that was economic related in Q1 to 28%, but still very solid growth, 28% in total for our international businesses on a local currency basis.
So we did see a little bit of decline in international media, but we saw a corresponding increase in ETM also growing 50% on a local currency basis.
The Amazon video on demand team is doing a terrific job. The strategy is very simple, which is to keep improving the customer experience of video on demand relentlessly as we go forward and at the same time to make it very easy for partners to integrate the video on demand service into their set top box or video display device.
So again, today you can use video on demand, Amazon video on demand very seamlessly on TIVO and also on the ROC2 box, so continuing to do those kinds of integrations is an important part of the strategy of making those integrations easy for our partners.

Sandeep Aggarwal – Collins Stewart
Obviously Kindle both generation one and generation two of Kindle did very well. Any plan to unleash the computing power of Kindle and let it compete with uniform factors like Net book which are gaining traction now?
Jeffrey Bezos
We're really focused on purposeful reading devices and so we wouldn't talk anyway about what we might do in the future, but I can tell you that we're really focused on devices with electronic displays that are purpose built for reading. 
Kindle 2 really is a terrific long form reading device and we think reading is an important enough activity that it deserves a purpose built device and that's really a sweet spot for us.

Your next question comes from Marianne Wolk – Susquehanna.
Marianne Wolk – Susquehanna
Can you update us on your cloud computing business and any initiatives of larger corporate accounts that you've been successful with. Also in the past you disclosed a number of web developers in your solution as nearly 400,000. Can you provide any update to that figure? And you reduced capacity earlier this quarter which appeared minor and head count fell by about 100 sequentially, can you comment whether these are cost control efforts and describe any other specific cost reduction initiatives in place that are helping margins.
Thomas Szkutak
Examples of enterprise customers using our infrastructure web services today, there are many but I'll name a few; Eli Lilly doing basic research, clinical trial analysis using UC2. ESPN is another user of UC2. Auto Desk is a user of UC2. There are many more, some of them preferred not to be identified for competitive reasons.
A number of hedge funds using UC2 for compute, so I'll just leave it at that. But there is good traction in the enterprise customer set as well of course there is with start up small business and medium business.
In terms of your other question related to head count, it's pretty flat. Q1 head count was pretty flat with year end. We did continue to hire but we also had attrition as well, so it remained pretty flat. 
In terms of other productivity, we have a large number of things that we're working on from a productivity standpoint. I talked about some of them earlier. We continue to work with suppliers to find ways where we can make them more successful as well as us more successful. One of the ways that we like, Jeff talked about some of the efforts we have earlier in Mark's question and one of the ways we spend a lot of time on is to get productivity is by becoming more efficient for customers.
We find that the many, many programs that we have, as they become more efficient for customers, translates into a better experience for customers, but it also results in productivity. So we have many, many different programs across the company. This is not something new. This is something we've been working on for quite a few years and as Jeff described earlier, we have a lot of opportunity to continue to work on those going forward as well.

Youssef Squali – Jefferies & Company
If I look at the segment breakouts and I look at your electronics and other in the U.S. there was a noticeable reacceleration of that business. Growth was at 42%. Can you help us understand why the reacceleration? Were there any sub categories that performed exceptionally well or better than your expectations?
Back to the Amazon VOD, what would be the hurdles to allowing Amazon to move into a subscription model in addition to the current offering that you already have?
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of electronics and other general merchandise we did see strong growth in North America. We also saw strong growth in international, and it was we continue to add selection and those categories, we continue to improve our in stock level so that when customers came to our VOD to order it was available right away for shipment.
And pricing was very, very competitive, so we think the combination of certainly prices, adding additional selections in stock and certainly fast delivery with prime helping those numbers as well.
Jeffrey Bezos
In answer to the video on demand subscription, there's nothing structural that would prohibit that. The amount of selection that you have available in a subscription model today is much less than what you can get with a la carte model. So that's the beginnings of an answer to your question.

I was hoping to get your perspective on some of the regional and national initiatives to impose sales taxation on the internet. For example, what you might expect to see in terms of any impact on demand perhaps from a historical perspective.

Operator
Your next question comes from Imran Khan – J.P. Morgan.
Imran Khan – J.P. Morgan
I think some of the retail companies and some of the online retailers also talked about business conditions stabilization are improving. Your business was not impacted that much by the economy. Can you give us sense, have you seen some sign of improvement in your growth as we focused at the end of the quarter.
And third party business is growing at a faster pace and becoming a bigger part of the business. The challenge is I think you are extremely focused on improving user experience. As third party becomes a bigger part of the business, how close are you monitoring the users for consumer satisfaction and how do you guarantee that consumer gets the same satisfaction as when they buy from Amazon when Amazon is the principal?
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of growth rate, it's obviously difficult to say what the economic impact is but we certainly starting Q4 by looking at our overall growth rates we saw solid growth rates but not as strong as we saw for the several quarters previous to that and you saw the same thing again in Q1.
So our Q1 revenue growth was 25% on a local currency basis, but last year in the first three quarters, it was well into the 30's and so we did see some slow down both in Q4 and in Q1. But we're not doing anything different than we've done in the past. We continue to focus on what we think are the right things for customers and that's what we're doing. So it's hard to say what the economic impact is.
Jeffrey Bezos
On the third party sales business question, how do we guarantee the customer experience in that third party model, there are a couple of ways. One, we maintain score cards on the sellers and the sellers are very interested in self improvement. The fact of the matter is, the vast majority of sellers do a very good job fulfilling for customers and the small fraction that do not, we can provide them feedback and we can ultimately ask them not to sell on Amazon.
The second thing we do is we have the AZ guarantee so ultimately we can take care of customers if the seller cannot. And then third, we have fulfillment by Amazon so fulfillment by Amazon really levels the experience and makes it so that those third parties sold items have exactly the same fulfillment and customer service experience as Amazon owned inventory.
Operator
Your next question comes from Heath Terry – FBR Capital Markets.
Heath Terry – FBR Capital Markets
Given that third party this quarter was 32%, that's a number that's been surprising stable for awhile and given the growth that you're obviously seeing to some degree in third party in Europe. Can you give us a sense of where you feel like the right balance for that is and to the extent that you're willing to talk about the difference in where you are with third party as a percentage of your units in the U.S. or as a percentage of orders in the U.S. versus Europe and what level do you see that balancing out?
Jeffrey Bezos
Ultimately the customers can decide what that mix ends up being and what we're trying to do is make sure we have a great customer experience. Certainly for our consumers we continue to work as well on our sellers which is another customer set that we have and so the way you should think about it is we're trying to make those two experiences as well as our third customer set which is developers.
In terms of mix, the customer is ultimately going to decide and what we're trying to do is make that experience as good as we can make it and so that the customers will decide who they buy from.
We haven't disclosed what the numbers are for each of the two segments but looking at Q1, both segments are growing nicely.

We haven't split out the specific geography numbers but we're very pleased with the business we have in China. It's growing nicely and we think that it's an interesting long term opportunity for us.

Gene Munster – Piper Jaffray
If you could talk a little bit about Prime and the overall percentage of products on Prime right now. I know you talked about some of Amazon and how do you basically fulfill and promote more products being offered by Prime. And can you talk a little bit about behavior when people actually sign up for Prime, just general difference in how people's behavior changes once they become Prime.
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of selection we have very vast selection in Prime and so it's just a very good experience for customers and we continue to add to that selection. We continued to add selections back in Q1. We'll continue to add selection in the coming quarters for our Prime customers.
We're seeing customers do a lot more cross shopping than they have previously and so it's a very good experience for customers. It's certainly impacting the growth rates that you're seeing not only this quarter but the last several quarters so it's a very good experience for customers.
Jeffrey Bezos
When Tom talks about Prime section growing, it is millions of different items and it is across all categories so you can use your Prime membership to buy shoes, to buy food, to buy diapers, to buy media products and electronics and so on. But it's across a wide array of categories and growing every day.

Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com fourth quarter 2008 financial results teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. (Operator instructions) Today’s call is being recorded. And for opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Rob Eldridge. Please go ahead, sir.
Rob Eldridge
Hello and welcome to our Q4 ‘08 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Thomas Szkutak, our CFO. Jeff Bezos, our Founder and CEO, and Tom will both be available for Q&A.
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management’s views as of today, January 29, 2009 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today’s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.
As you listen to today’s call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2007. Now I’ll turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas Szkutak
Thanks, Rob. Let me start by reviewing our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month free cash flow grew 16% to $1.36 billion. Return on invested capital was 41%, down from 55%. ROIC is trailing 12-month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt, over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 446 million shares compared with 435 million.
Worldwide revenue grew 18% to $6.7 billion, or 24% excluding the $320 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rate. Media revenue increased to $3.64 billion, up 9%, or 15% excluding FX. EGM revenue increased to $2.89 billion, up 31%, or 36% excluding FX. Worldwide EGM increased to 43% of worldwide sales, up from 39%. Worldwide unit growth was 28%.
Active customer accounts exceeded 88 million, up 16%. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 1.5 million, up 18%. Seller units were 27% of total units versus 26%. Worldwide gross profit was $1.35 billion, up 15%.
Now I’ll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content, and G&A combined was $989 million, or 14.7% of sales, down 9 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $530 million, or 7.9% of revenue compared with 8.2%. Tech and content was $236 million, or 3.5% of revenue compared with 3.4%.
Now I’ll talk about our segment results. And consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense/income, net line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 18% to $3.63 billion. Media revenue grew 7% to $1.75 billion. EGM revenue grew 30% to $1.73 billion, representing 48% of North America revenues, up from 43%.
We are particularly pleased with Kindle demand during the fourth quarter. We want to remind everyone that Kindle revenue and cost are recognized over a two-year period. The Kindle Store contains the largest collection of e-books available anywhere in the world. Selection increased by 45,000 titles in the fourth quarter, bringing the total to 230,000 titles. 103 out of 112 current New York Times Best Sellers are available and, along with most new releases, are priced at $9.99 or less. In addition, the Kindle Store recently added the Arizona Republic, Baltimore Sun, Orange County Register and USA Today and now offers newspapers from eight of the top ten metro areas in the United States.
North America gross profit grew 12% to $781 million and gross margin decreased 114 basis points to 21.5%, driven by lower prices for our customers, including free shipping offers in Amazon Prime, and changes in product mix, partially offset by higher other revenue. North America segment operating income declined 15% to $130 million, a 3.6% operating margin.
In the International segment, revenue grew 19% to $3.07 billion. Revenue growth was 31%, adjusting for the $308 million year-over-year unfavorable FX impact during the quarter. Media revenue grew 12% to $1.89 billion, or 22% excluding FX. And EGM grew 32% to $1.16 billion, or 46% excluding FX. EGM now represents 38% of international revenues, up from 34%.
International gross profit grew 20% to $567 million, or grew 32% excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates, while gross margin increased 23 basis points to 18.5%, driven by improvements in our vendor pricing and increases in 3P product sales, partially offset by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix. International segment operating income increased 31% to $229 million, a 7.4% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange, International segment operating income increased 48%.
CSOI grew 9% to $359 million, or 5.4% of revenue, down 44 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $26 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, CSOI grew 17%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income increased $1 million to $272 million, or 4.1% of net sales.
Our income tax expense was $79 million in Q4, or 26% rate for the quarter. In 2008, we paid $53 million in cash taxes. A majority of our tax expense is non-cash because we have current tax benefits and NOLs related to excess stock-based compensation. GAAP net income was $225 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, compared with $207 million and $0.48 per diluted share.
Now I’ll discuss the full year results. Revenue grew 29% to $19.17 billion, or 28% excluding $127 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in FX. North America revenue grew 26% to $10.23 billion and international grew 33% to $8.94 billion, or 31% year-over-year growth, excluding the year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. Consolidated segment operating income or CSOI grew 29% to $1.09 billion, or 28% excluding $10 million of favorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange, and operating margin remained at 5.7%. GAAP operating income grew 28% to $842 million, or 4.4% of net sales.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $615 million year-over-year to $3.73 billion. Our cash and marketable securities primarily consist of cash, government, and government agency securities, AAA-rated money market funds, and other investment grade securities. Such amounts are recorded at fair value. During the quarter, we repurchased $2.2 million of our common stock for $100 million.
Inventory increased 17% to $1.4 billion, and inventory turns were 12.2, down half a turn from prior year, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels globally, and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 29% to $3.59 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 62 from 57 in the prior year. Our investment in net fixed assets increased $311 million from a year ago to $854 million. Our 2008 capital expenditures were $333 million.
I will conclude my portion of today’s call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including the high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It is not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as marking our Euro-denominated debt to market quarterly, intra-company balances and foreign currencies that settle amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolutions of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have material effect on guidance. Our guidance assumes that we don’t conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that FX rates remain approximately where they have been recently.
For Q1, we expect net sales of between $4.525 billion and $4.925 billion, a growth of between 9% and 19%. This guidance anticipates approximately 600 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income to be between $125 million and $210 million, or between 37% decline and 6% growth. This includes approximately $75 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $200 million and $285 million, or between 23% decline and 10% growth. This guidance anticipates approximately 600 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange. We anticipate our free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to our operating profit growth rate over time with some variability, including from changes in working capital and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection, and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
Thanks. And with that, Rob, let’s move to questions.
Rob Eldridge
Great. Thanks, Tom. Let’s move on to the Q&A portion of the call with Jeff and Tom. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. (Operator instructions) Our first question this afternoon will come from Scott Devitt with Stifel Nicolaus.
Scott Devitt – Stifel Nicolaus
Hi, thanks and congratulations on the continued success. I have two questions if I could. They are a little bit longer term in nature. First, I was wondering if you could just comment on the early progress of your large company focus, cloud computing initiative that you recently launched with Gemini and whether you think that you would pursue further initiatives or partnerships in that area to target enterprise level customers. And then secondly, on Amazon Video, which is now being distributed through several partners to get it towards the TV and it’s now a pay-per-view service, could you just comment on what your long-term ambitions are in terms of a business model potentially shifting from pay-per-view toward a subscription model as more digital content is available? Thanks.
Jeff Bezos
I’ll answer those. As far as – on the first question, we think there is a very significant and meaningful opportunity over time for enterprise level customers with our web services business. This is the Elastic Compute Cloud and the Simple Storage Service are already being used by a number of enterprise level customers, and we expect that trend to continue. On the business models for video, did you say we have a pay-per-view model now? I just wouldn’t want to speculate too much on what we might do in the future.
Scott Devitt – Stifel Nicolaus
Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Citi. Your line is open.
Mark Mahaney – Citi
Great. Thanks. Jeff, just on the Kindle, I know you’re not disclosing a lot on it, but any major surprises from your perspective, maybe in terms of overall usage, any cannibalization, or do you just sense that overall it just materially increase the overall book purchases of customers? And then, Tom, really quickly, did you see material signs of discounting in the quarter? I assume you did. And just thoughts on if your strategy for dealing with significant discounting in the marketplace was different this year than in prior years, given the large third party base you have now. Thank you.
Jeff Bezos
With Kindle sales, we see that when people buy a Kindle, they actually continue to buy the same number of physical books going forward as they did before they owned a Kindle. And then incrementally, they buy about 1.6 to 1.7 electronic books, Kindle books, for every physical book that they buy. So, so far what we’re seeing is very strong incremental book unit sales, which of course we’re very pleased to see. The biggest surprises so far for Kindle have just been the unusually strong demand that we saw in the fourth quarter. We had anticipated strong demand, and what we saw was stronger than that. So we are extremely grateful for that, and we will keep marching forward here.
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of your second half of your question, Mark, there is absolutely no change in strategy related to pricing. We are trying to make sure we offer a great value to customers. We operate in a very competitive marketplace. And certainly we saw that in Q4, which is reflected in the gross margins that you see in our Q4 results. So again, no change in strategy, and it was certainly very competitive and that’s reflected in the results that you see.
Mark Mahaney – Citi
Thank you, Tom. Thank you, Jeff.
Operator
Our next question will come from James Mitchell with Goldman Sachs.
James Mitchell – Goldman Sachs
Thank you very much for taking my question. I guess I noticed that your additions drawn under [ph] revenue approximately doubled year-over-year despite Kindle was being out of stock most of the quarter. Could you speak to whether that reflects very strong uptick of Prime or very heavy Kindle sales, the period when they were in stock? And then separately, it looks like your North American media revenue growth decelerated quite sharply from 3Q to 4Q, right? Your international media revenue ex-FX was fairly stable in terms of year-over-year growth rates from 3Q to 4Q. I was wondering if that reflected purely macro economic motives or if there was anything else such as Harry Potter or video game strike there? Thank you.
Thomas Szkutak
The other revenue, in addition to the items that you mentioned, contains a number of things, including Prime and our credit card relationships and advertising et cetera. And so we did very solid growth there. In terms of your – can you repeat the second half of your question, James? Sorry.
James Mitchell – Goldman Sachs
Sure. It looks that your North American media growth decelerated I think mid-teens year-over-year growth in the third quarter, 7% in the fourth quarter, whereas your international media revenue growth remained at around 20% in both 3Q and 4Q ex-FX. I was wondering if there was anything kind of special behind the divergence in growth paths other than the US economy path slowing more sharply.
Thomas Szkutak
Yes – no – we had – it wasn’t just the media. It was across the board. If you look at media and EGM, we had stronger growth in international. We saw growth in total exchange of 31% in international. And we have – we focus on the same things that we focus in North America are the fundamentals, making sure we have great pricing. Certainly Prime is having any impact in international as well as North America, and offering just a great value proposition. Certainly one thing to keep in mind, we look at international though we have launched in addition to adding a lot of selection within existing categories, in all of our categories globally. We’ve launched approximately 25 categories over the past two years or so that certainly have an impact on the growth rates as well.
James Mitchell – Goldman Sachs
Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post – Merrill Lynch
Looks like a lot of offline retail stores are under some pressure, and there is a lot of store closures. Can you talk a little bit about anything you’ve seen in the music category historically from that? Has it helped you at all? And how can you take advantage of maybe some of that next year, any competitive initiatives that might help the company?

I think it’s difficult to say what, if any, short-term impacts you might see from that. And in the long-term, these are – fortunately the markets that we operate in are very large markets and there is room for lots of winners. And so I don’t think there is going to be much impact to the long-term – continue to be a very competitive environment.

Mr. Post, any further questions?
Justin Post – Merrill Lynch
No, that’s all. Thank you.

Thank you. We will move next to Douglas Anmuth with Barclays Capital.
Douglas Anmuth – Barclays Capital
Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Could you talk about how you’ve been impacted or I guess maybe whether you’ve been impacted at all since you’ve begun collecting taxes in New York in the middle part of the year? And then also, what are you seeing in terms of new Prime memberships? Is there any kind of slowdown or deceleration in this type of macro environment? Thanks.
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of sales tax, we collect in certainly a number of states in the US, many jurisdictions outside of the US. In fact, approximately half of our business today that we are actually collecting some type of either sales tax or value-added tax. And we have very good businesses in those geographies. And so I can’t comment much beyond that. In terms of Prime, we are very pleased with what we’re seeing in Prime. We have very good subscriber growth and customers like it. We certainly saw that was evidence further in Q4 during the holiday season and reflect in the results that you see for Q4. So again, we’re very pleased. And again, it’s something that we offer in most geographies today, and we’re very pleased with how it’s performing.

Our next question will come from Imran Khan with J.P. Morgan.
Imran Khan – J.P. Morgan
Yes, hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Two questions. First, active seller accounts were up 18% on a year-over-year basis. If my memory is correct, it accelerated from 17% in Q3, better understanding what’s really driving the active seller accounts so much for you guys. Second question, it’s been reported that DVD sales are pretty weak. And I was wondering if you are seeing any weakness on the DVD sales. In fact, those changes (inaudible) that, and any comments on Blu-ray. Thank you.
Thomas Szkutak
Sure. In terms of the active sellers, as we’ve talked about in the past, we have three customer sets, are the consumers, sellers, and developers. And we start with those customers in each of the things that we do and work backwards. And we’ve focused very heavily on the seller experience over the last several years, and that’s what’s we believe is driving the active seller account growth. In terms of categories, any accounts on categories within the breakouts that we have, like for DVD, I can’t comment much. And – but certainly, we think we like the – you mentioned Blu-ray, we like the Blu-ray business. And we certainly have great selection in DVDs as well as – in the original format as well as Blu-ray. And you are certainly seeing the customers like that. But beyond that, there is not a lot I can add to it.
Imran Khan – J.P. Morgan
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
We will take our next question from Jeetil Patel with Deutsche Bank.
Jeetil Patel – Deutsche Bank
Great. Thank you. Congrats. Two questions. In the current environment, how much data do you have or analysis do you actually do in your customer base to figure out spending propensities by, say, geographies, zip codes, vintage of when they were added, household income to better forecast the business. Are you getting to that granular level of detail to assess kind of your trend lines of business as you look at Q1 guidance and I guess how you look internally into budgets? And then second, does the current environment, as enterprise level spending slows down, create increased interest or open up the conversation around the web services? What you can provide for enterprises these days, or can you just comment a little bit more about how those conversations are progressing?
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of the first part of your question, it’s certainly a very data-driven business. And we look at many, many different things, primarily though from a – when you think about some of the data that we do look at, it’s very heavily focused on the customer experience side, how do we make sure that we are priced appropriately in our products, how we make sure that we’re serving our customers the way we want to and reducing all the customer facing defects in every way that we touch the customer. And so those are the areas that we focus very, very heavily on. And certainly we look at other metrics as you would expect, but that’s really where the focus is. Could you repeat the web services question?
Jeetil Patel – Deutsche Bank
Yes. On web services, I guess there is – you lower the cost of a computing for companies that utilize the service. I’m curious, as I guess the budgets become tighter as you look ahead for enterprises out there, does that open up the conversation for what you can provide larger companies on web services, or is that still ways to go in terms of that conversation with larger Fortune 500 accounts in the market?
Thomas Szkutak
I think it does open up those conversations. The people are, in this macro environment, looking for ways to save money, and cloud computing does do that. So it improves utilization, improves deficiency. There is a lot that can be done there. And so if you’re looking for a silver lining in the macro environment, I think that is – what you are suggesting is correct.
Jeetil Patel – Deutsche Bank
Do you think it’s still too early to see the impact of that in terms of, I guess, conversations? Or are we just still too early in terms of the business cycle and the downturn?
Thomas Szkutak
No, I think on the edges, you’re seeing it already. And I suspect that that momentum will continue.
Jeetil Patel – Deutsche Bank
Thanks.
Operator
We will go next to Jeffrey Lindsay with Sanford Bernstein.
Jeffrey Lindsay – Sanford Bernstein
Thank you for taking my question. Could you share with us any of your thinking on your next product categories and your geographic priorities going forward, international versus the US, why you see the kind of expansion opportunities to drive growth going forward? And then could you just mention – could I ask Tom – do you plan to put any hedging programs in place? Thank you.
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of the product categories and geographies, fortunately we have a longstanding practice of not talking about which categories will launch next. So I apologize, I can't help on that. But again, we – in addition, just as a reminder, in addition to looking to new categories to add selection, we’re continually adding selection within the categories that we’re in. In terms of hedging, we are not doing really any hedging today using instruments. We have certainly a lot of natural hedging. And what I mean by that we are predominantly in those geographies that we operate in. We’re pricing in local currency. The vast majority of both the COGS as well as operating costs are in local currency. We’re certainly exposed to the income and the cash flows that we generate in those geographies, but we’re not hedging those. That’s something that’s been consistent for sometime, and again because we’re taking as long-term view and again trying to approach it mostly from a natural perspective.
Jeffrey Lindsay – Sanford Bernstein
Thank you.

Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray, your line is open.
Gene Munster – Piper Jaffray
Good afternoon, and congratulations on impressing results. If you could talk a little bit about the margin side of the equation? I know you had briefly touched on it, but a lot of the offline retailers had given up top line – given up bottom line to hit top line. And you guys got the best of both worlds. It sounds like that going forward you don’t see any changes into how you think about gross margin. If the environment would get progressively more difficult, do you see yourself potentially changing some of your perspective on margins and intend to keep the traffic in the volume and keep building the platform that’s been successful?
Thomas Szkutak
There is no – again, we operate in a competitive environment. Like we talked about earlier as well as in the past calls that we’ve had, we’re going to offer great values to customers. You can expect that to continue going forward. We certainly did see an impact and you can see that our gross margins during Q4. We had a larger decline certainly than we’ve had year-over-year than we’ve had – if you look at the trailing 12-month trend, and that’s one of the reasons that certainly pricing is certainly a part of that, but certainly a foundation of our models to make sure that we offer great value to customers and we’ll continue to do so going forward.
Gene Munster – Piper Jaffray
Thank you.

Youssef Squali with Jefferies & Company.
Youssef Squali – Jefferies & Company
Thank you very much. Just a follow-up on the same kind of line of questioning. As – I guess with the ongoing closure of brick-and-mortar stores, short-term not within next two years as you were talking about earlier, but short-term within the next three to six months, what is the risk to pricing from just the –out of inventory that’s likely to persist from the troubled retailers through the summer? How much of that have you kind of modeled into your numbers? And then a quick question for Tom. The midpoint of Q1 implies about a 14% in revenue growth and about 3.5% margin versus 4.8% in Q1 of last year, where do you see the most pressure on the P&L? Is it on the gross margin side or in OpEx? Thanks.
Jeff Bezos
In terms of the first part of your question, that’s really hard to know. And so if you look at our Q1 guidance, you can see that we’ve given a pretty wide range. If you look at the high end of the range, you can see that the growth rate, excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates, would be 25%, little bit above where we came in in Q4. If you look at the bottom line CSOI, the growth rate excluding the impact of exchange is approximately when we came in again in Q4. But again it’s a wide range. And that wide range reflects both the macro environment and the uncertainty. And so we think it’s appropriately conservative but reflects that uncertainty.
Youssef Squali – Jefferies & Company
And Tom?
Operator
Mr. Squali, any further questions, sir?
Youssef Squali – Jefferies & Company
Yes. Maybe just a follow-up on the second question for Tom about the impacts on the P&L from the – what the implied guidance implies? Is there more of a pressure on gross margin or the P&L – I’m sorry – or OpEx?
Thomas Szkutak
Yes. In terms of – we’re not giving line item detail in terms of our guidance range. But if you take a look at Q4, you can see that our operating margins were down year-over-year. And that was largely driven by gross margins being down. All that said, we still had growth in CSOI as well as free cash flow, and the revenue growth of 24% excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates. So that’s what we saw in Q4. And we’ll have to get back to you when we close the quarter and share with you what happened in Q1.
Youssef Squali – Jefferies & Company
Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator
We will take our next question from Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse.
Spencer Wang – Credit Suisse
Thanks. Good afternoon. So the North American operating expenses were up about 19% year-over-year. I know that includes a lot of the allocation for the technology and content cost. But I was wondering if you could just speak to excluding some of the growth initiatives like Kindle, what was the kind of underlying cost growth in North America. And then secondly, I know you guys bought back about $100 million of stock in the fourth quarter, which was I think the first time all year you bought back stock. Can you just help us understand how you’d be redeploying your free cash flow in ’09? Thank you.
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of the first question, we haven’t split out the operating expenses by segment, but you can see it in total. You can see that we did get some leverage in our total operating expense. One thing to keep in mind is, when you look at our operating expense for Q4, it does not reflect just what happened in Q4. In other words, we were adding resources throughout the year in 2008. You can see from looking at the headcount that we had in – the reporting that we show in the press release that certainly our headcount growth slowed in Q4 – sequentially from Q3 to Q4. And so again, we’re not giving line item details, but you can look at the totals between G&A, marketing, technology and content, and G&A for our business. In terms of the – from a cash standpoint, we’re not – there is not a lot I can comment on going forward. What I can tell you related to the $100 million was an opportunistic buy. And we’re being what we believe to be appropriately conservative with our cash.
Spencer Wang – Credit Suisse
Great. Thank you.
Operator
Sandeep Aggarwal with Collins Stewart.
Sandeep Aggarwal – Collins Stewart
Thanks for taking my question. Just if you can talk about, Jeff, on the Prime members in terms of as they enter from one year to second year, have you seen their propensity to buy changing and what about the average selling price? And we’ll appreciate any comments in terms of the traction you are seeing with Fulfillment by Amazon.
Jeff Bezos
Sure. One of the things that we see with Prime in terms of customer behavior is that Amazon Prime members tend to buy a wider range of categories, of product categories. And we also see incremental lift from those customers. I think both of those things you would expect to see given the people have made a commitment by buying the $79 membership and equivalent kinds of memberships for different prices around the world. So anyway, that’s – Amazon Prime is doing what we hoped it would do in that regard. And we’re pleased with the traction. We work very hard to make sure that the customer experience for Prime members makes it worth their while to pay that $79 and to renew that membership. Fulfillment by Amazon is getting very good traction. And one of the nice kind of closing of a feedback cycle there is that you get now some of the third party sales are eligible for Amazon Prime. So, to the degree that customers like Amazon Prime and to the degree that sellers like Fulfillment by Amazon, they are closing that loop and helping each other. So we are very pleased with both of those programs. Every time a third party seller starts using Fulfillment by Amazon, their sales go up, which the seller likes. And the customers all of a sudden get Amazon Prime membership privileges on those third party items, which the consumer likes. So the two things that really is nice to close that loop, and we’re excited about the potential that will keep pushing ahead on it.
Operator
Our next question comes from Heath Terry with FBR Capital Markets.
Heath Terry – FBR Capital Markets
Great, thank you. Jeff, can you look at the third party efforts in Europe? How would you compare the growth and the product offering and the composition of your partners there to where the US was at the same stage of that business? And then also if you can give us an idea of if you’ve seen any attrition in your third party seller base in the US or Europe that you might feel would be related to the economy, I’d appreciate it.
Jeff Bezos
Anecdotally I don’t think we have seen the kind of attrition that you’re talking about. We are – our third party business continues to do well. And as Tom said earlier, we’ve been working for many years on the seller experience and we will continue to work on that. And with things like Fulfillment by Amazon, it is one of the ways that we work on improving that seller experience.
Heath Terry – FBR Capital Markets
Great. And then as far as how Europe compares to the US at the same point and your development of that offering there?
Jeff Bezos
We don’t break that out, at least quantitatively. But we are very happy with the way that third party sellers are – how that’s performing globally.
Heath Terry – FBR Capital Markets
Great. Thank you.

Jim Friedland with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
Jim Friedland – Cowen and Company
The P&L from Q4, there was some leverage than usual gains on a year-over-year basis in Fulfillment and a little bit in G&A as well. And I was just wondering if there is anything unique going on there, were there any one-time items.
Thomas Szkutak
In fulfillment and G&A –
Heath Terry – FBR Capital Markets
Yes.
Thomas Szkutak
No, not really. I think it’s – you’re seeing certainly – we gave a wide range of guidance. We were in the upper end of the guidance range. And we’ve got decent leverage on our operating costs as a result.
Heath Terry – FBR Capital Markets
And in terms of the utilization of your Fulfillment synergy, you’ve invested a lot lately. How much incremental investment do you need there? Is it something that you need to spend less on versus previous years or more? And I’m not –
Thomas Szkutak
I appreciate it. We did not give total year guidance, and we just gave Q1 guidance. So in terms of moving forward, there is not a lot I can talk to there. And again the reason why we didn’t give guidance is because of the uncertainty in macro environment.
Heath Terry – FBR Capital Markets
Fair enough. Thanks.
Operator
Our final question will come from James Mitchell with Goldman Sachs.
James Mitchell – Goldman Sachs
Great. Thank you for taking a further question from me. It relates to the accounts payable. It looks like your accounts payable days increased from 57 to 62 year-on-year. There’s obviously been a lot of anecdotes about working capital tightness among suppliers. I wonder if you could talk about whether achieving the increase in accounts payable days in this environment was unusually challenging or not, given I assume (inaudible) big well-capitalized buyers. Thanks.
Thomas Szkutak
We work with our suppliers for our overall terms. The payment terms happen to be just one piece of that. And we continue to work and partner with those suppliers. That was really the result of a lot of work that happened throughout the year and Q4. There is not a lot more beyond that I could comment.

Good day, everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com third quarter 2008 financial results teleconference. (Operator Instructions) For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Rob Eldridge. Please go ahead. 
Rob Eldridge
Hello and welcome to our Q308 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. Jeff Bezos, our Founder and CEO, and Tom will both be available for Q&A. 
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management’s views as of today, October 22, 2008 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. 
Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today’s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our 2007 annual report on Form 10-K. 
As you listen to today’s call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. 
During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. 
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2007. 
Now I’ll turn the call over to Tom. 
Thomas J. Szkutak
Thanks, Rob. I’ll begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased 21% to $970 million. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 448 million shares compared with 435 million. 
Return on invested capital was 32%, down from 42%. Worldwide revenue grew 31% to $4.26 billion, or 28% excluding the $80 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. In Q3 2007, worldwide revenue benefited by approximately 290 basis points of year-over-year growth from Harry Potter 7 sales plus attachments. Excluding Harry Potter 7 plus attachments and changes in foreign exchange rates, revenue growth was 31%. 
Media revenue increased to $2.49 billion, up 19%, or 17% excluding FX. 
EGM revenue increased to $1.64 billion, up 52% or 49% excluding foreign exchange rates. Worldwide EGM increased to 38% of worldwide sales, up from 33%. 
Worldwide unit growth was 30% or 32% excluding Harry Potter 7 plus attachments. 
Prime membership increased more than 70% from the prior year and Amazon premium, the French version of Amazon Prime, launched on October 1st. We expect more customers to save time and money by using Amazon Prime to ship their gifts to friends and family this holiday season. 
Active customer accounts exceeded 84 million, up 17%. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 1.4 million, up 17%. Seller units were 31% of total units, unchanged from the prior year. 
Worldwide gross profit was $999 million, up 31%. 
We recently lowered the free shipping threshold from 15 pounds to 5 pounds in the U.K. Super Save shipping is an important component of our overall value we provide and customers have save more than $700 million with our free shipping offers over the past 12 months. 
Now I’ll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing and technology and content and G&A combined was $768 million, or 18% of sales, up 8 basis points year over year. Fulfillment was $378 million, or 8.9% of revenue, compared with 8.7%. We opened new fulfillment centers in Arizona, Indiana, and Pennsylvania to support continued expansion of selection and customer demand. 
Technology and content was $226 million, or 5.3% of revenue compared with 5.6%. 
Now I’ll talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments for stock-based compensation or other operating expense. 
In the North America segment, revenue grew 29% to $2.3 billion. Media revenue grew 15% to $1.25 billion. Kindle selection continues to grow. Since inception, we have more than doubled the number of books, magazines, newspapers, and blogs available to be delivered wirelessly in less than one minute. Kindle titles already account for more than 10% of unit sales for books that are available in both digital and print formats. We’ve ramped up manufacturing capacity over the past 10 months and Kindles are in stock and available for immediate shipment. Kindle sales since launch have significantly exceeded our expectations. We will not introduce the new version of the Kindle until next year at the earliest. 
EGM revenue grew 51% to $950 million, representing 41% of North America revenues, up from 35%. 
North American gross profit grew 28% to $586 million and gross margin decreased 24 basis points to 25.5%, driven by lower prices for our customers, including free shipping offers in Amazon Prime, and changes in product mix, partially offset by higher other revenue. 
North America segment operating income increased 12% to $88 million, a 3.8% operating margin. 
In the international segment, revenue grew 33% to $1.96 billion. Revenue growth was 28%, adjusting for the $80 million year-over-year favorable FX impact during the quarter. 
Media revenue grew 24% to $1.25 billion, or 18% excluding FX, and EGM grew 54% to $690 million, or 48% excluding FX. EGM now represents 35% of international revenues, up from 30%. 
International gross profit grew 37% to $413 million, or grew 32% excluding FX, while gross margin increased 53 basis points to 21.1%, driven by increases in 3P, product sales, and improvements in vendor pricing, partially offset by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix. 
International segment operating income increased 46% to $143 million, a 7.3% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from FX, international segment operating income increased 39%. 
CSOI grew 31% to $231 million, or 5.4% of revenue, unchanged year over year. Excluding the $5 million favorable impact from FX, CSOI grew 28%. 
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 26% to $154 million, or 3.6% of net sales. 
Our income tax expense was $59 million in Q3, or a 33% rate for the quarter. We estimate our effective tax rate in 2008 will be approximately 28% and that cash taxes paid will be less than $75 million. However, there is potential for significant volatility due to several factors, including variability in accurately predicting the amount and mix of taxable income by jurisdiction and business acquisitions or investments. We are endeavoring to optimize our global taxes on a cash paid basis, not for tax expense on a financial reporting basis. 
GAAP net income was $118 million, or $0.27 per diluted share compared with $80 million and $0.19 per diluted share. 
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $416 million to $2.32 billion year over year. Our cash and marketable securities primarily consists of cash, government agency securities, triple A rated money market funds, and other investment grade securities. Such amounts are recorded at fair value. 
Inventory increased 36% to $1.32 billion and inventory turns were 12.4, unchanged from the prior year, even as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels across product categories and geographies, and introduced new product categories. 
Accounts payable increased 34% to $2.24 billion and accounts payable days increased to 63 from 62 in the prior year. 
Our investment in net fixed assets increased $240 million from a year ago to $731 million. Our Q3 2008 capital expenditures were $102 million. During the quarter, approximately $132 million in principal amount of our 4.75 convertible subordinated notes converted into 1.7 million shares of common stock and we redeemed for cash the remaining total of $266 million in principal amount of the notes. 
I will conclude my portion of today’s call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. We experienced slower rates of growth towards the end of the third quarter, coinciding with disruptions in the global financial markets. While guidance takes into account these growth rates, our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by factors, including the high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It is not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
As we describe in our more detail in our public filings, issues such as marking our Euro denominated debt to market quarterly, intra-company balances and foreign currencies that settle amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material affect on guidance. 
Our guidance assumes that we don’t conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that FX rates remain approximately where they have been recently. 
For Q4, we expect net sales of between $6 billion and $7 billion, a growth of between 6% and 23%. This guidance anticipates greater than 500 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange. 
GAAP operating income to be between $145 million and $305 million, or between 46% decline and 13% growth. This includes approximately $85 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. 
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $230 million and $390 million, or between 30% decline and 19% growth. 
For the calendar year 2008, we expect net sales of between $18.46 billion and $19.46 billion, a growth of between 24% and 31%. This guidance anticipates approximately 100 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. 
GAAP operating income to be between $716 million and $876 million, or between 9% growth and 34% growth. These amounts include the impact of the $53 million non-cash gain recognized in the second quarter of 2008 on the sale of the company’s European DVD rental assets. This includes approximately $300 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. 
We anticipate 2008 consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $964 million and $1.124 billion, or between 13% growth and 32% growth. 
We anticipate our free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to our operating profit growth rate over time, with some variability, including from changes in working capital and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. 
We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection, and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. 
Thanks and with that, Rob, let’s move to questions. 
Rob Eldridge
Great, thanks, Tom. Let’s move on to the Q&A portion of the call with Jeff and Tom. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?
Question-and-Answer Session

Operator
(Operator Instructions) We’ll go first to James Mitchell with Goldman Sachs.
James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs
Thank you very much for taking my question. It looked like your third quarter margin was better than your guidance, despite the new fulfillment centers, whereas for the fourth quarter, you are guiding for margins to be flat to down year-on-year. Is that a delta going into the fourth quarter primarily because you anticipate cutting prices to sustain sales growth, or is there anything else that is going into the margin evolution?
Thomas J. Szkutak
Well, the guidance that we’ve given, we gave a relatively wide range of guidance that we believe to be appropriately conservative and prudent certainly in this environment, and so it depends on really where you look at the range. You know, you see also a fairly sizable range on the operating margins as well on the bottom but it reflects again both the wide range and also the fact that our -- implicit in the assumptions that we gave for Q4, certainly a sizable change from currency as well, which is impact both the top and the bottom. 
Operator
We’ll go next to Doug Anmuth with Barclays Capital.
Doug Anmuth - Barclays Capital
Can you tell us what you are seeing in terms of early discounting from your competitors as we go towards the holidays? And what level of discounting does the midpoint of your CSOI guidance imply relative to last holiday season? Thank you. 
Thomas J. Szkutak
You know, we operate in a very competitive environment. That’s not something that’s new. We have competitors offline, you know, as you go to your home or office, you drive by or walk by those every day. We have certainly a number of online competitors as well, so we have -- we are very used to operating in a very competitive environment and we’ve been very successful at making sure that we have great prices for customers in this environment and that’s not something that is new. That is something that we have been dealing with for many years, and so it is certainly hard to predict what will happen over the course of any given quarter but what we think will happen is reflected in the guidance that we have given today. 
Operator
We’ll go next to Scott Devitt with Stifel Nicolaus.
Scott Devitt - Stifel Nicolaus

Two questions, if I could -- first in terms of the gross and operating margin by region, the domestic margin continues to go down and international go up and your third party units have been sustained at about 31% of total. So I’m just wondering if the margin impact is driven by the mix shift, where the U.S. business first party’s growing faster than third and third party faster than first international. 
And then secondly, could you give either a number or the impact that you had implied in fourth quarter guidance for currency when you gave guidance on the third quarter call for the implied fourth quarter guidance? 
Thomas J. Szkutak
Your questions on margins to start with, those were operating margins or -- 
Scott Devitt - Stifel Nicolaus
Well, both but I guess maybe just looking at gross margin, because -- 
Thomas J. Szkutak
You were cutting out, so operating?
Scott Devitt - Stifel Nicolaus
It would be gross margin. 
Thomas J. Szkutak
Okay. You know, certainly you are seeing -- just think about it from an opportunity standpoint. We have more room to certainly -- or more opportunity certainly in our international segment as you look at our gross margins. That’s something that we’ve been talking about for quite some time. You know, there’s a number of factors there. Certainly we had a lot more newer categories over the past few years then in North America, although we are adding categories in both segments and selection dramatically in both segments. 
So you have a number of factors but certainly we are earlier in third party and international, as well as the category mix in terms of where we are from a geography standpoint and our ability to get better prices with supplies has improved, so those are factors that are certainly impacting our international segment. 
In terms of the exchange guidance, we obviously didn’t give [inaudible] implied, we didn’t give guidance for Q4 last time. We gave guidance for Q3 and the total year but I think this will be helpful. 
Basically if you take the top end of the range, the $20.1 billion that we gave last time for revenue, right now we are talking just under 19.5, 19.463, so that’s a little over $600 million. We said that last time that the total year would be more than 400 basis points of favorable impact from exchange. Now we are saying approximately 100 basis points. In dollar terms, that’s approximately $500 million and so -- and the bulk of that more than $400 million is in Q4, from a change from last time, if that’s helpful. The remainder is in Q3. If you’ll remember, we said approximately 450 basis points for Q3 for exchange. That came in approximately 240 roughly, so that’s the delta, if that helps.

We’ll go next to Mark Mahaney with Citigroup.
 
Mark Mahaney - Citigroup
A couple of quick questions -- that was a very significant increase in headcounts this quarter, more than we’ve seen in the past. Was there something new about where those people are being deployed?
Secondly, you made a comment about seeing some disruptions at the end of the third quarter from some of the -- some of the economic dislocations. Did you see that continue into the December quarter? 
And then the final question has to do at the very high end of your range, your guidance range in Q4, if you adjust for FX implies very little deceleration on a much tougher organic revenue comp. So I guess the question is are you seeing something that -- what would allow you to actually do something like 28% organic revenue growth? Are there new categories, new international launches that could allow you to get to the high-end of the range in a really troubling market with a tough comp? Thanks. 
Thomas J. Szkutak
I’m sorry, could you just repeat the first part of the question, Mark?
Mark Mahaney - Citigroup
A lot of new employees, 2100 new employees added in the quarter. That’s a lot more than we’ve seen in the past. Any new place for deployment of those employees?
Thomas J. Szkutak
The vast majority of those employees, a very high percentage of those, are in operations and customer service as we get ready for Q4. In some of my opening remarks, you also heard me talk about we opened three new fulfillment centers and certainly that’s part of that increase, so again a very high percentage of that is again ops and CS related. 
In terms of the guidance, you mentioned the upper end. You know, we gave a pretty wide range of guidance. We think that that’s prudent during this -- you know, when the environment is uncertain and it’s -- and we have limited visibility as all companies have in this environment, so we think that that’s appropriate. But again, certainly the upper end of guidance, if you look at our Q3, we saw very solid growth, 31% on a dollar basis, 28% excluding exchange. Keep in mind that we are overlapping Harry Potter 7 from last year. The impact that we mentioned last year was approximately 290 basis points, so if you back that out it rounds to 31% growth excluding Harry Potter and foreign exchange rates. 
And you know, we think we are relatively well-positioned. We’ve been working very hard for years on making sure that we have a great experience with customers. We are trying to make Q4 even better than last year. We think we are well-positioned to do that. We have added a lot of selection and we have worked very hard at pricing. We have not only our free shipping offers around the world but certainly Prime has grown a lot since last Q4, so we are very optimistic from a customer experience standpoint and we will have to see where that ends up from a revenue perspective and that’s why we are giving the wide range that we have given today. 
Mark Mahaney - Citigroup
Thank you, Tom.

(Operator Instructions) We’ll go next to Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch
Thank you. In September, can you talk about the fundamentals -- you did see some softness. Was it customers, units? I imagine also ASPs on the currency but any detail on that. 
And then secondly, some nice metrics on the Kindle. As books go more digital and you hopefully can capitalize on the Kindle, does that help Amazon's long-term profitability or hurt it? How do you look at that over a long-term basis? 
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of what we have seen, you know, I talked about currency. Currency moved a lot, as part of the disruption in the financial markets towards the end of the quarter, through the quarter and towards the end of the quarter and obviously much more recently as well. And in terms of -- we certainly saw some slowness of growth in areas as you would expect with the disruptions in the financial markets. 
You know, one data point certainly we saw a deceleration of growth in purchase items over $1,000, and so that’s really one item that we saw. But again, what we’ve seen is factored into the guidance that we have given and as I mentioned, because of our model and because we have worked very hard at not only having low prices and affording low prices but knowing where we are relative to others, we think that that positions us very well in this environment. It positions us well in up environments, you know, customers want great values in good environments but they want especially good prices in this environment, you know, the macro environment that we are under today. 
So again, hard to tell, which is why the range that we’ve given for guidance, where we will end up but we think we are positioned very well. 
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch
And then on the Kindle? How do you see that affecting your long-term profitability in the book segment?
Jeffrey P. Bezos
 
Well, one thing that I think you could imagine happening over the long-term there is that the prices of books will be cheaper, so most of the books that we are offering on Kindle today are $9.99, even if they are $20 or $25 in print form. And so you can see that -- I think that probably the best way to answer your question is we would hope to sell many more units and make less money per unit but all in, have a very strong business. 
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch
Thanks, Jeff. 
Operator
We’ll go next to Jeetil Patel with Deutsche Bank.
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank
A couple of questions -- first of all, Jeff, can you characterize what you are seeing in this downturn or kind of issues in the marketplace or spending habits compares to what you saw maybe Q3, early Q4 back in 2000 when the bubble burst, just as a basis of comparison, how would you characterize it?
Second, your operating margins, consolidated segment operating margins are down sequentially in Q4 when typically you get the effects or economies of scale advantage on your side. I guess I’m just trying to figure out, understandable that your FX is going against -- the FX is going against you but it seems like you should be seeing your costs come down a bit, at least from an international standpoint. Is there something else going on in the number, your plan to kind of keep spending up as it relates to marketing or just overhead and fulfillment that’s going to be the drain from a margin standpoint as you look at Q4 relative to Q3? Thanks. 
Jeffrey P. Bezos
 
On the first part of your question, relative to 2001, it’s a very difficult question to answer in large part because Amazon has changed so much in that intervening time period. We have so many more product categories now than we did then. The scale of the business is very different, the operating efficiency of the business is very different. We have spent a lot of time and hard work reducing defects at the root so that we can have lower operating costs and pass on lower prices to customers. 
I love our position today in the marketplace because we have been spending so much time making sure we are the low-cost provide and that is a -- you know, something that is likely to be appealing to people in this kind of economy. So not only low cost but also -- low cost on part prices but matching that with free shipping. So it’s difficult to make that comparison. If you go back in time, we were able to find back then certain segments of our business which were impacted, they were very technology related, like computer books and investing in business books and so on. Our business is now so much more diversified across product categories, although as Tom mentioned we have seen deceleration in items, for example, of above $1,000. 
So I guess I would leave it at that -- very difficult to make crisp comparisons relative to that time period. 
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank
What about customer behavior wise?
Jeffrey P. Bezos
 
And in terms of your operating margin question in terms of looking at it sequentially, as you see from the guidance, the implied operating margins would have at the higher end being sequentially up and on the lower end, down. And certainly when you plan for the seasonal quarter you plan for a peak. We are getting ready certainly for what we hope to be a strong quarter. We think we are well-positioned for that and having facilities and associated structure to support that, and so that is what we are trying to do, trying to make sure that we support it. So if we are at the lower end of guidance, we’ll have certainly some of the costs but not the revenue to support that. But again, we think we are well-positioned for Q4.

We’ll go next to Brian Pitz with Banc of America Securities. 
Brian Pitz - Banc of America
Thanks. We’ve seen third-party data suggesting that your share increase in the large TV market has continued to do very well. We are wondering if you expect the move to digital broadcasting by February to accelerate TV and related sales in Q4 and Q1. And then separately, would you provide any additional color on the growth in advertising related revenue to your business? Thanks. 
Jeffrey P. Bezos
 
You know, it’s really hard to say on the TV side. What I would say though is like the comment we made on across the business, we are going to make sure that we have great prices and that is something that we have been doing. And we do have great selection in that area that you are referring to in terms of the large TVs, so we are certainly a -- we should be in the customers’ consideration set, given the service that we provide and the selection and the prices. So I think that’s -- in terms of what will happen related to next year is difficult to say. 
Brian Pitz - Banc of America
And then just on advertising, any comments?
Jeffrey P. Bezos
 
I would say historically, our primary means of driving demand has been to focus on what we consider to be the  primary customer experience drivers -- low prices, free shipping, selection, speedy delivery, and we are going to continue. We think that’s likely to continue to be the best way to drive demand in our business. 
Brian Pitz - Banc of America
Great, thanks.

We’ll go next to Jeffrey Lindsay of Sanford Bernstein.
Jeffrey Lindsay - Sanford C. Bernstein
Would you be able to give us some insights as to your plans for the payments business and how fast do you see that moving ahead? Do you think it is going to be a meaningful contributor to growth or margins going forward? And if so, what time scale?
And then also, could you just give us an indication -- when you make electronic sales of media, are they completely cannibalistic to your traditional media sales or are they additive? Thank you. 
Jeffrey P. Bezos
 
So far what we have seen with the Kindle book units is that they are additive to physical book units. So when somebody buys a Kindle and the period after, you know sort of the post purchase period post buying a Kindle, they buy 1.6 times as many Kindle books as they bought physical books prior to buying a Kindle, and they continue to buy the same number of physical books. So that’s what we have seen so far and it’s a very -- obviously a very positive outcome. We hope that continues.

We’ll go next to Imran Khan from J.P. Morgan.
Imran Khan - J.P. Morgan
Thank you for taking my questions. One key question is if this recession lasts longer than many of us would like it to, a lot of companies are talking about cost containment. As you look out over the next 18 to 24 months, how are you thinking about managing your cost over the next 18 to 24 months? Do you think you will continue to invest in the business or do you think if there is a recession, you will contain some costs?
Jeffrey P. Bezos
 
Our thinking is that we are going to continue to invest in the business but we are going to be especially prudent in how we make those investments. We just think that’s sensible in the context of this macro environment. 
And let me answer the payments question from the prior caller who I forgot to answer, but the -- basically we have a couple of services today, external payment services. One call the flexible payment service, checkout by Amazon, simple pay. Those are the three primary ones. And these things are new offerings. The flexible payment service is designed for software developers to be able to design and build their own payment services, or to deeply integrate payments into whatever application they happen to be building and it has a sophisticated and a very well thought through set of APIs that enable great flexibility. 
Checkout by Amazon and Simple Pay are for merchants on third-party websites to be able to incorporate Amazon payments into their websites so that their customers can use their Amazon credentials when checking out. These are new seeds that we’ve planted and the question was what kind of time line might those businesses become meaningful, and that’s very difficult to say. We would keep working at those businesses and hope that over time, they would become meaningful. 
Thomas J. Szkutak
And just to add on to Jeff’s previous answer related to the next 18 to 24 months, and you were -- from a program perspective, keep in mind that we have been operating in an environment of challenging prices, a very competitive environment for some time. We have also been operating in an environment where we have been offering free shipping, for example, while fuel prices have been going up dramatically. These are things that are not new to us and so in addition to the programs and being prudent, we are going to continue to work on defect reduction, which will help us from a cost structure standpoint, continue to work on other things to make our overall cost structure improved over time. 
Imran Khan - J.P. Morgan
Can I ask one more question? I was going to ask, you know, you talked about the weakness in the overall business. Could you give us maybe more color into that -- what kind of trends are you seeing in the U.K. market?
Thomas J. Szkutak
I don’t have a lot to add to the U.K. but again on the total business, we are actually very pleased with what we saw in Q3. You know, in a -- we think in a relatively challenging environment, we think 31% growth on a dollar basis, 28% excluding exchange and 31% excluding exchange and Harry Potter is relatively strong. And we think that we are well-positioned for customers and the environment that we are in during Q4 and we are getting ready right now for that seasonal time. 
Imran Khan - J.P. Morgan
Great. Thank you.

Our final question will come from James Mitchell with Goldman Sachs.
James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs
I apologize for taking two questions but I guess my question was just once again, you have dramatically broadened the revenue range you are guiding to for the fourth quarter this year versus a much narrower range, for example, in the fourth quarter last year and I fully understand that the world is a different place today, unfortunately, from what it was then. But does the broader revenue range purely reflect greater uncertainty about constant currency spending by consumers, or are you effectively building in some headwind or tail room for further FX moves, given how volatile the currencies have been the last few weeks?
Thomas J. Szkutak
It reflects a broad range of items and as I mentioned earlier, we have -- all companies have limited visibility we think right now and we are no different, and so we are putting together what we believe to be appropriately conservative guidance. It is a wider range than we have given before, both in dollar terms and percentage terms. We think that is prudent in this environment and again, we are going to focus on what we do best, which is satisfying customers and we think we are well-positioned to do that, so that’s what we plan on doing. 
James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs
Could I ask a super-quick follow-on question? It looks like you’ve cast the super saver delivery charge in the U.K. from 15 pounds to 5 pounds. Do you see yourself stimulating growth globally through lower shipping costs this Christmas, and is that part of what is going into your margin consideration?
Jeffrey P. Bezos
 
We reduced the Super Saver delivery threshold from 15 pounds to 5 pounds, so you now in the U.K. only have to order 5 pounds or more of items to get the Super Saver delivery. And basically we did that because from a cost structure point of view, we were in a position to do it. So you should think of that as an example of us doing the kinds of things you have seen us do over the last 10 years, which is try to figure out how to lower prices and then to lower prices. 
James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs
Great. Thank you very much.

Good day, everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com second quarter 2008 financial results teleconference. (Operator Instructions) For opening remarks I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Rob Eldridge; please go ahead. 
Rob Eldridge
Hello and welcome to our Q2 2008 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Thomas Szkutak, our CFO. Jeffrey Bezos, our Founder and CEO, and Tom will both be available for Q&A. 
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management’s views as of today, July 23, 2008 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. 
Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today’s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
As you listen to today’s call we encourage you to have our press release in front of you which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our Investor Relations website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. 
Finally unless otherwise stated all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2007. 
Now with that I’ll turn the call over to Thomas. 
Thomas Szkutak
Thanks, Rob. I’ll begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased 16% to $816 million. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 446 million shares compared with 435 million. Return on invested capital was 29%, down from 39%. Worldwide revenue grew 41% to $4.06 billion, or 35% excluding the $182 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in FX. 
Media revenue increased to $2.41 billion, up 31%, or 25% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $1.53 billion, up 58% or 52% excluding foreign exchange rates. Worldwide EGM increased to 38% of worldwide sales, up from 34%. 
Worldwide unit growth was 32%. Active customer accounts exceeded $81 million, up 18%. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than $1.4 million, up 18%. Seller units were 29% of total units, unchanged from the prior year. Worldwide gross profit was $967 million, up 38%. 
Now I’ll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content and G&A combined was $722 million, or 17.8% of sales, an improvement of 83 basis points year-over-year. Tech and content was $218 million, or 5.4% of revenue compared with 6.1%. 
Now I’ll talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. 
In the North America segment revenue grew 35% to $2.17 billion. Media revenue grew 25% to $1.15 billion. EGM revenue grew 52% to $920 million representing 42% of North America revenues, up from 38%. We saw another quarter of strong sales in electronics, toys and baby, consumables, and soft goods, which includes jewelry, apparel, shoes, and sporting goods. 
North America gross profit grew 29% to $559 million and gross margin decreased 129 basis points to 25.8% driven by changes in product mix and lower prices for our customers including free shipping offers at Amazon Prime. North America segment operating income increased 17% to $96 million, a 4.4% operating margin. 
In the international segment revenue grew 47% to $1.89 billion. Revenue growth was 34% adjusted for the $179 million year-over-year favorable impact from foreign exchange rates during the quarter. Media revenue grew 38% to $1.26 billion, or 25% excluding FX, and EGM revenue grew 68% to $611 million, or 52% excluding FX. EGM now represents 32% of international revenues, up from 28%. 
International gross profit grew 52% to $408 million, or grew 38% excluding foreign exchange rates, while gross margin increased 66 basis points to 21.5% driven by increases in [three p] product sales, improvements in vendor pricing and higher other revenue partially offset by lower prices to our customers and changes in product mix. International segment operating income increased 80% to $149 million, a 7.9% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange rates, international segment operating income increased 56%. 
Consolidated segment operating income grew 49% to $245 million, or 6% of revenue, up 31 basis points. Excluding the $17 million favorable impact from FX, CSOI grew 38%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 86% to $217 million, or 5.3% of net sales. 
Included in the second quarter 2008 GAAP operating income is a $53 million non-cash gain recognized on the sale of our European DVD rental assets. 
Our income tax expense was $46 million in Q2 or a 22% rate for the quarter. We estimate that our effective tax rate in 2008 will be approximately 28% and that cash taxes paid will be less than $75 million. However there is potential for significant volatility due to several factors including variability in accurately predicting the amount and mix of taxable income by jurisdiction and the business acquisitions or investments. We are endeavoring to optimize our global taxes on a cash paid basis, not for tax expense on a financial reporting basis. 
GAAP net income was $158 million, or $0.37 per diluted share compared with $78 million and $0.19 per diluted share. 
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $789 million to $2.63 billion year-over-year. Inventory increased 51% to $1.11 billion and inventory turns improved to 13, up from 12.9 in the prior year even as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels across product categories and geographies and introduced new product categories. 
Accounts payable increased 52% to $1.96 billion and accounts payable days increased to 58 from 54 in the prior year. 
Our investment in net fixed assets increased $208 million from a year ago to $651 million. On a trailing 12 month basis capital expenditures increased $78 million, up 40% year-over-year. Our Q2 2008 capital expenditures were $69 million.
During the quarter approximately $473 million in principal amount of our four-and-three-quarter convertible subordinated notes converted into 6.1 million shares of common stock and we redeemed $27 million from principal amount of the notes. 
I’ll conclude my portion of today’s call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we’ve seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. However there is a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It’s not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as marking our euro denominated debt to market quarterly, intra-company balances and foreign currencies that settle amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material affect on guidance. Our guidance assumes that we don’t conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently. 
For Q3 we expect net sales of between $4.2 billion and $4.425 billion, a growth of between 29% and 36%. This guidance anticipates approximately 450 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be between $115 million and $160 million, or between 6% decline and 31% growth. This includes approximately $80 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. 
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $195 million and $240 million, or between 10% growth and 36% growth. For calendar year 2008, we expect net sales of between $19.35 billion and $20.1 billion, a growth between 30% and 35%. This guidance anticipates greater than 400 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. 
Our GAAP operating income to be between $745 million and $920 million, or between 14% growth and 40% growth. This includes approximately $295 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. 
We anticipate 2008 consolidated segment operating income which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $1.040 billion and $1.215 billion, or between 22% growth and 43% growth. Our goal continues to be operating leverage in 2008, with CSOI growing faster than revenue on a percentage basis. 
We anticipate our free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to our operating profit growth rate over time, with some variability including from changes in working capital and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. We expect capital expenditures including capitalized software development costs to be approximately $325 million. 
We will continue to strive for year-over-year annual growth of free cash flow and free cash flow per share while investing in our long-term opportunities. We are confident that if we continue to improve customer experience and execute efficiently our value proposition as well as our free cash flow will expand. 
Thanks and with that let’s move to questions. 
Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney – Citigroup
Mark Mahaney – Citigroup
I wanted to ask about some of the digital media offerings, are there any data points, it’s a highly competitive space, music, video and now e-readers online, particularly the first two, what are the data points that you look at to judge how well you’re doing in that segment? Anything you can share with us and then any comment at all on the kindle and what kind of—how many units you’ve sold or any kind of demand metrics there?
Jeffrey Bezos
We don’t really breakout those digital figures. What I can tell you on kindle is that we’re not releasing the number of units of kindle that we’ve sold, the number of devices, what we have said is that we are, if you look at the universe of titles where we saw the kindle version, so those 140,000 different titles, the percentage of all-in units that in kindle unit form versus their physical book equivalent for that same universe is low double-digits at this point, which we’re very excited about. 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post – Merrill Lynch
Justin Post – Merrill Lynch
It looks like for several quarters now third party units were growing faster then your own units, it looks like it was kind of flat this quarter, are there any changes there? And as you look forward it looks like margins might be slightly lower operating income margins going forward, is that trajectory affecting your margin outlook as you look out to the back half?
Thomas Szkutak
To answer your first question third party units [or] the percentage of total units was 29% which is flat with last year. Keep in mind that our unit growth did accelerate in total so our unit growth was 32%. Also keep in mind or another data point is our third party units did grow faster then our retail units this quarter. So again, we’re still seeing very, very good growth there. A couple of things to think about the active seller accounts if you will, are up 18% year-over-year that compares to a year ago where they’re up 11%. We’ve had several quarters where we’ve seen accelerated growth of active seller accounts. So again we think that the business looks good. It’s really not impacting the guidance as we think about it. We’re very positive about both our retail business and our third party business. Ultimately the customer will decide what units they buy and we’re trying to make the experience better for customers and for sellers. 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of David Joseph - Morgan Stanley
David Joseph - Morgan Stanley
On that point of unit growth, so it seemed like it accelerated while gross margin actually declined year-over-year, so it seems that Amazon might be getting a little bit aggressive on pricing. I’m wondering if you might be able to provide a little bit more color on that and then just really a math question, excluding the sale of an asset for $45 million operating margin ex dot com according to our math would have come in line with our estimate of about 6.0%, is that correct?
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of pricing we’ve been pretty consistent. We’re trying to make sure we have very competitive pricing across many different categories and many different geographies and so we’ve spent a lot of time trying to make sure that that is the case and we’re always looking for ways to improve that to make sure we have the most, the best information as we do that. So that, in terms of a process standpoint, nothing has really changed there.
In terms of your question on the gain the gain was, the $53 million gain was not included in our guidance, it’s included in our GAAP operating income. It’s not included in our CSOI so if you look at our CSOI of $245 million, it’s not included in that number. So again, the range we gave for CSOI for Q2 was $200 million to $240 million; we came in at $245 million. The $245 million does not include the gain.

Your next question comes from the line of Jeetil Patel – Deutsche Bank
Jeetil Patel – Deutsche Bank
It seems like the flywheel is working internationally, if you look at third party and Prime, it looks like your kind of getting the similar lift that you got in the US as you had the Prime service ramp up. I guess if you could frame for us where international stands in terms of the ramp phase relative to going back in the North American market where timeframe revolution, where international looks today with third party and Prime versus domestically. And then second is there a way for you to leverage your customer buying relationships with consumers in your technology platform to basically go after other retailing opportunities. I guess I’m trying to allude to Universal Wish List and how that fits in and maybe even a Universal payment service from an affiliate standpoint how that fits into the grand scheme of things.
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of the first part of the question regarding third party and Prime its difficult to give a timeframe but I would say on both its certainly earlier for both, so both in terms of our third party as well as Prime in terms of penetration. And that’s really because we’ve been at it longer in North America. We like the progress that we’re making in both accounts in North America and international but its earlier as you’d expect.
Could you just repeat the second part of your question? 
Jeetil Patel – Deutsche Bank
I’m just trying to understand how your customer buying relationships with over 80 million customers and your technology that you’ve been building out for years now, just how does an idea like Universal Wish List, which I think is available on the site or payments fit into that. How do you take your existing assets and how do those fit into that?
Jeffrey Bezos
In the case of Universal Wish List we have a very large number of folks using the Amazon Wish List and we have for a number of years and so that’s a—basically a thriving feature and the idea behind Universal Wish List is that, its really just a customer service that as people go about their business on the web, if they would like to add something to their wish list from another vendor on another website we make it very easy for them to do that. So then they have still one place to point their friends and relatives to, to see their Universal Wish List.

Your next question comes from the line of James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs
James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs
Could you talk a little bit about your third quarter operating income guidance, I think in 2007 your operating income ticked up a little quarter-on-quarter from 2Q to 3Q and for this year you’re guiding for it to tick down a little, I wondered if that was due to just general corporate conservatism or whether there was any specific driver?
Thomas Szkutak
The only thing I’d call out is and we have announced a number of capacity increases and fulfillment and certainly with the large growth that we’ve seen, you’re seeing—you saw leverage in Q1 and Q2 on our fulfillment expense as a percentage of revenue. With the added capacity it’s a little bit lumpy in Q3 but we’re adding additional capacity to serve Q4. It is typical that we do it in Q3, we also do it in other quarters but it’s just a little bit lumpy in Q3 and certainly reflected in the guidance that we’ve given for Q3.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Pitz – Banc of America Securities
Brian Pitz – Banc of America Securities
First a question on taxes, would you comment on any changes in demand from New York State customers given the recent collection of sales taxes there and then a separate question on gross margins, a gap remains between North America and international gross margins, can you talk about the key leverage points that will help to close the gap there?
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of New York, its really too early to comment there but I just want to remind everyone that we really collect either sales tax or value-added tax on approximately 50% of our business today and we collect at a number of states in the US, we collect in a number of the geographies outside of the US and so we have very good businesses in those geographies. In terms of your gross margin question, you’re absolutely right; we do have a delta between our North America and international business. A couple of the dynamics there, one of them which we talked about a little bit earlier, certainly our third party penetration is higher in North America then it is in international, and so that’s an opportunity for us. Certainly as we get the scale we’ve launched many, many new categories in international over the past 18 months and as those categories get more and more to scale, there’s opportunities on the margin side there. And so those are certainly the key ones in terms of differences.

Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Lindsay - Sanford C. Bernstein
Jeffrey Lindsay - Sanford C. Bernstein
What is the impact on your delivery and fulfillment charges particularly with regard to Prime, of increased transportation costs, is this really a 2009 phenomenon for you or is there a possible increase in delivery cost coming through the pipeline? And then could you just give us a comment on how you’re seeing any impact from consumer confidence on sales, product mix, sales frequency, smaller ticket items, are you seeing any difference now that consumer confidence is significantly lower?
Jeffrey Bezos
On the fuel prices we suspect that higher fuel prices may be a relative advantage for us both in terms of relative to physical world stores because of the expense of driving to a store, even just driving 10  miles these days is a few dollars worth of gasoline and consumers we suspect are beginning to take that into account and think about that and try to do trip consolidation and so certainly our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime become very high, a clearly of even more value to customers under that set of circumstances. 
And then relative to other online retailers because of our scale we have a distributed fulfillment center network that places products closer to customers that allows us to do fast transportation to customers, fast deliveries to customers but usually using ground transportation instead of air transportation and ground transportation is much more fuel efficient then air transportation. So probably this is a relative advantage for Amazon and its our job to insulate customers since we offer free shipping and Amazon Prime offers fast free shipping, the burden is upon us to make sure that we can do that in a way that is economical for us so that customers can continue to enjoy those free shipping offers and we have clearly no intention of changing those. We’ll keep them in place. 
Jeffrey Lindsay - Sanford C. Bernstein
Do you think it will impact your margins negatively going forward?
Thomas Szkutak
This is something that we’ve been dealing with for quite some time, as part of our overall cost structure. We started in the US some of the free shipping offers back in 2002 I believe. Oil prices were around $22.00 a barrel back in 2002. They’ve continued to grow and certainly it is more costly but it’s not something that’s really new to us. Its part of our overall thinking as we look at our costs. 
Jeffrey Lindsay - Sanford C. Bernstein
Are you seeing any change in consumer buying habits because of the lower consumer confidence?
Thomas Szkutak
We’re probably not the best bell weather for the economy and certainly one indication of that is just looking at our overall growth rates that you see for Q2. We have growth rates of 35% excluding the impact of the exchange that accelerated from last year where we saw a little bit under 33% excluding exchange and also an acceleration from Q1. So I don’t think I can really help.

Scott Devitt – Stifel Nicolaus
As it relates to the guidance and the change for the guidance last quarter you gave full year GAAP Op In guidance $740 to $940 and the GAAP operating income this quarter was I believe $57 million above expectations including the $53 million gain so I’m trying to get my hands around the updated guidance which is mostly unchanged from the prior GAAP operating income guidance and whether this new guidance includes or excludes the $53 million gain. 
Thomas Szkutak
Yes, the GAAP, the guidance excludes the $53 million gain.

Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers
Doug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers
On CapEx it looks like you raised your outlook by about $25 million so CapEx is now expected to be up about 46% year-over-year, can you talk about why the increase there and then can you detail the contribution from audible during the quarter?
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of the CapEx the increase, we spent CapEx in a number of different areas, certainly a big portion of it is fulfillment related also infrastructure related and then a few other smaller areas and so those are really the drivers for the CapEx growth, not only the increase from $300 to $325 but also the increase year-over-year. So really it relates back to the growth of the business which is causing that increase. 
Doug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers
And the audible contribution?
Thomas Szkutak
We’re not breaking out the audible piece in our results for Q2.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Weinstein – Pacific Crest Securities
Steve Weinstein – Pacific Crest Securities
If we want to back out the $53 million gain for the sale of the DVD business what would the offsetting tax impact be for that?
Thomas Szkutak
I can’t talk to the tax piece, I guess the best way to say it is the estimate for the year is 28% and you see a first half effective tax rate of 26% and that gain is reflected in the first half results in the 26% effective tax rate. Again our estimate for the year is 28%.
Operator
Your final question comes from the line of Imran Khan – JP Morgan
Imran Khan – JP Morgan
One of the biggest value propositions for your biggest consumer business in price discount and free shipping and things like that, as 30% of your business is now coming the sellers business how do you ensure the quality, the security and the safety that the consumer gets from your main business. The free cash flow growth rate was 16% versus 51% and I can understand that can fluctuate quarter-over-quarter and how should we think about the full year free cash flow growth rate?
Jeffrey Bezos
For your first question the first way we do that is because we have an astonishingly good group of sellers who take their customer experience and the customer service that they provide on Amazon very, very seriously, and we give them lots of metrics and tools to help them manage that experience. So that’s sort of the first answer to your question is the sellers do a very good job. Some better then others and we try to make it very clear both to the sellers and to the consumers the quality of that particular seller.
The second thing is that we are more and more having sellers take advantage of fulfillment by Amazon which is a program that lets sellers put their inventory in our fulfillment centers. This is a very big advantage for sellers because it increases their sales. When sellers move into fulfillment by Amazon they end up selling more. The second reason it’s a big advantage is it’s a big advantage for the consumer because now those third party items are eligible for super saver shipping, they’re eligible for Amazon Prime, a third party item can be married together and put in a box with an Amazon retail item so that the outbound transportation is more efficient. 
So there are a lot of advantages to fulfillment by Amazon and that’s another kind of a second part to the answer for how that third party business can have a very high level of customer experience for our consumers. Your question is a very good one, its one we think about a lot and we take very seriously. 
Thomas Szkutak
In terms of the second part of your question we’re not giving guidance on annual free cash flow but just wanted to comment for a second on the Q2 growth, Q2 of last year if you go back to actually Q1 of last year we had free cash flow growth of 4%, Q2 on a trailing 12 months last year was a growth of 87% and the sequential growth was 34%. That was a difficult compare and a little bit of an anomaly compared to the last several years. If you look back over the last several year period you’ll see that our sequential growth that we had this quarter from Q1 to Q2 was very consistent with what we’ve seen other then that. 
And if you look at the underlying pieces and metrics that support free cash flow you’ll see that our consolidated segment operating income over the past 12 months was up 56%, our AP days were up four days, our inventory turns were essentially flat 13 versus 12.9, and our CapEx was up 40% which was just slightly under our trailing 12 month revenue growth. So those are the underlying pieces that I think are most significant.

Good day, everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com first quarter 2008 financial results teleconference. (Operator Instructions) For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Rob Eldridge. Please go ahead, sir. 
Rob Eldridge
Hello and welcome to our Q1 2008 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. Jeff Bezos, our Founder and CEO, and Tom will both be available for Q&A. 
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management’s views as of today, April 23, 2008 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. 
Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today’s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our 2007 annual report on Form 10-K. 
As you listen to today’s call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. 
During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. 
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2007. 
Now I’ll turn the call over to Tom. 
Thomas J. Szkutak
Thanks, Rob. I’ll begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased 51% to $788 million. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 435 million shares compared with 430 million. 
Return on invested capital was 32%, up from 30%. Worldwide revenue grew 37% to $4.13 billion, or 31% excluding the $185 million of favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. 
Media revenue increased to $2.54 billion, up 28%, or 21% excluding FX. 
EGM revenue increased to $1.48 billion, up 56% or 50% excluding FX. Worldwide EGM increased to 36% of worldwide sales, up from 31%. 
Worldwide unit growth was 31%. Active customer accounts exceeded $79 million, up 19%. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than $1.3 million, up 17%. Seller units were 30% of total units versus 29%. Worldwide gross profit was $956 million, up 33%. 
Now I’ll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $698 million, or 16.9% of sales, an improvement of 103 basis points year over year. Tech and content was $203 million, or 4.9% of revenue compared with 5.5%. 
Now I’ll talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments for stock-based compensation or other operating expense line items. 
In the North America segment, revenue grew 31% to $2.13 billion. Media revenue grew 22% to $1.2 billion. EGM revenue grew 46% to $826 million, representing 39% of North America revenues, up from 35%. 
We saw another quarter of strong sales in electronics, toys and baby, consumables, and soft goods, which includes jewelry, apparel, shoes, and sporting goods. 
North America gross profit grew 29% to $569 million, and gross margin decreased 33 basis points to 26.7%, driven by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix. 
North America segment operating income increased 52% to $130 million, a 6.1% operating margin. 
In the international segment, revenue grew 44% to $2.01 billion. Revenue growth was 31%, adjusting for the $179 million year-over-year favorable FX impact during the quarter. 
Media revenue grew 34% to $1.34 billion, or 22% excluding FX, and EGM revenue grew 71% to $655 million, or 56% excluding FX. EGM now represents 33% of international revenues, up from 27%. 
International gross profit grew 38% to $387 million, or grew 26% excluding FX, while gross margin decreased 81 basis points to 19.3%, driven by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix, partially offset by increases in product sales by our sellers. 
International segment operating income increased 36% to $128 million, a 6.4% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from FX, international segment operating income increased 19%. 
CSOI grew 44% to $258 million, or 6.2% of revenue, up 29 basis points. Excluding the $14 million favorable impact from FX, CSOI grew 36%. 
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 36% to $198 million, or 4.8% of net sales. 
Our income tax was $62 million in Q1, or a 30% rate for the quarter. We estimate our effective tax rate in 2008 will be approximately 30% and that cash taxes paid will be less than $75 million. However, there is potential for significant volatility due to several factors, including variability in accurately predicting the amount and mix of taxable income by jurisdiction and business acquisitions or investments. 
We are endeavoring to optimize our global taxes on a cash paid basis, not for tax expense on a financial reporting basis. 
GAAP net income was $143 million, or $0.34 per diluted share compared with $111 million and $0.26 per diluted share. 
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $830 million to $2.4 billion year over year. Inventory increased 43% to $1.08 billion and inventory turns improved to 13.1, up from 12.9 in the prior year, even as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels across product categories and geographies, and introduced new product categories. 
Our investment in net fixed assets increased $152 million from a year ago to $594 million. Our Q1 2008 capital expenditures were $61 million. 
I will conclude my portion of today’s call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. However, there is a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It is not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
As we describe in our more detail in our public filings, issues such as marking our Euro denominated debt to market quarterly, intra-company balances and foreign currencies that settle amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have material affect on guidance. 
Our guidance assumes that we don’t conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that FX rates remain approximately where they have been recently. 
For Q2, we expect net sales of between $3.875 billion and $4.075 billion, a growth of between 34% and 41%. This guidance anticipates approximately 700 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. 
GAAP operating income to be between $120 million and $160 million, or between 3% growth and 38% growth. This includes approximately $80 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. 
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $200 million and $240 million, or between 21% growth and 46% growth. 
For the calendar year 2008, we expect net sales of between $19.1 billion and $20 billion, a growth between 29% and 35%. This guidance anticipates greater than 400 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. 
GAAP operating income to be between $740 million and $940 million, or between 13% growth and 43% growth. This includes approximately $285 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. 
We anticipate 2008 consolidated segment operating income which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $1.025 billion and $1.225 billion, or between 21% growth and 44% growth. Our goal continues to be operating leverage in 2008, with CSOI growing faster than revenue on a percentage basis. 
We anticipate our free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to our operating profit growth rate over time, with some variability, including from changes in working capital and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. 
We expect capital expenditures, including capitalized software development costs, to be approximately $300 million. 
We will continue to strive for year-over-year annual growth of free cash flow and free cash flow per share while investing in our long-term opportunities. We are confident that if we continue to improve customer experience and execute efficiently, our value proposition as well as our free cash flow will expand. 
Thanks and with that, Rob, let’s move to questions. 
Rob Eldridge
Thanks, Tom. Let’s move on to the Q&A portion of the call with Jeff and Tom. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?
Question-and-Answer Session

Operator
(Operator Instructions) We’ll take our first question from Jeetil Patel with Deutsche Bank Securities. 
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank
Thanks. A couple of questions; first of all, philosophically do you think your customers have a greater propensity to buy or show greater loyalty to your retail business and the third party, and I guess does that influence what the lifetime value of a customer is that is buying across let’s say retail or prime versus the third party business? 
And then second, now that you’ve rolled out internationally third party and prime, are you getting the type of incremental leverage from selection and reduced friction on the e-commerce side that you saw in the U.S. I guess over the last year and now you are seeing from an acceleration standpoint?
Jeffrey P. Bezos
I’ll take the first one. I think what our customers are focused on is whether they are getting excellent service in every one of their transactions and certainly for Amazon Prime members, we’ve raised the bar and offered the ability for customers to get products very, very quickly, very low cycle times, from the time they place the order until we are shipping it out our dock door and then it gets to the customer in two days for free. 
And what we are working to do with fulfillment by Amazon is make it possible for third party sellers to stow their inventory in our fulfillment centers so that we can offer the same level of service to our customers for those third party items that we do for the Amazon owned inventory. 
And we are seeing a lot of traction there. We are seeing a lot of happy sellers with fulfillment by Amazon and it is certainly great for customers, in part because they can get one box instead of two. So if they order something from Amazon and at the same time they order something from a third party seller, if we have that item in inventory we get to marry those two items together, ship them in one box. It’s a better customer experience. It saves transportation costs, transportation fuel, and it just works out better. There’s enough system wide cost savings that we can offer fulfillment by Amazon to the third party sellers at a very attractive price. 
But the driver of that program is, as with most things we do, starting with figuring out how we are going to make that customer experience great. We have this Amazon Prime customer experience. We want that to work for third-party sales and for third-party sellers. 
Rob Eldridge
Could you repeat the second part of the question --
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank
Yeah, I mean, if you look internationally, you’ve done -- you’ve rolled out third-party and prime in some of the major regions over the past year. Are you starting to see that incremental leverage of both selection from your third-party side as well as the reduced friction from prime helping to drive or accelerate growth as you’ve been seeing in the U.S.? 
Thomas J. Szkutak
Well, certainly with the third party, you know, we’ve had third party sellers in international for quite some time but we have launched some new features over the past few years with merchants at being more prominent in international. But we are very pleased with our third party sellers in international. It is certainly growing nicely, as well as the total is growing nicely. 
In terms of prime, we are very, very happy with what we are seeing but it is still very, very early and with a few countries just being launched a few months ago, and Japan about nine months ago, so we love what we see so far but it’s very early. 
Operator
We’ll take our next question from Imran Khan with J.P. Morgan.
Imran Khan - J.P. Morgan
Thank you for taking my questions. Two questions; first, international operating income growth rate excluding foreign currency decelerate pretty significantly. I was trying to understand how should we think about international gross profit and segment operating income growth rate?
And second question, in the U.S., can you give us some sense of, you know, if the U.S. economy slows and -- or continues to slow and if you see more price discounting from the other retailers, what kind of pricing you expect -- do you continue to maintain your price leadership and if so, how should we think about the gross profit dollar growth? Thank you. 
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of the international operating margins, what you are seeing is, if you take a look at it, it is really our gross margins were down year over year and what you are seeing is certainly lower prices in international was a piece of it. Also, if you just look at the mix of business, we had very, very strong growth in EGM, electronics and general merchandise. That was up 76% year over year -- excuse me, 71% year over year. Adjusted for FX it was up 56%, which is the strongest growth we’ve seen in quite some time in international. 
And if you think about it, if you look at a lot of the category launches that we’ve had, we’ve had approximately 16 category launches last year, so again a lot of these newer categories are starting and we are making sure that we have great prices right away, but we certainly don’t have the scale to buy yet in those particular categories. So you are seeing part of that. 
And then also offsetting some of those impacts of mix and pricing is certainly third parties growing at a faster rate, as well as COGS reduction. 
So that’s really what is happening in international and we think certainly adding a lot of new categories in that opportunity both for customers and investors over a long time is a good thing and it is something that we will continue to drive. 
In terms of the second part, our pricing strategy is very simple. We are going to make sure we have great low prices for customers. It is hard, certainly hard to predict what will happen over the course of the year but we think we have reflected what we do think is going to happen in the guidance that we’ve given today. But we are going to make sure that we have great prices and great selection and on top of that, this wasn’t part of your question but you know, we think that in this type of environment externally, customers want great value and so that is both in down times and up times, and we think that that’s good, and so we are going to concentrate and make sure that we have the right processes in place to make sure we have the right prices for customers. 
Imran Khan - J.P. Morgan
Thank you.

We’ll go next to Heath Terry with Credit Suisse. 
Heath Terry - Credit Suisse
Thank you. I was wondering if you could give us an update on the third party business in Europe, particularly with your ability to attract the larger third party partners, like Martin Spencer and of course, Target in the U.S. You mentioned that third party is 31% of overall business. That number has been pretty stable for a while, despite the launch into Europe. Can you give us an idea of what kind of impact Europe is having and if there is some kind of offset in the U.S. that is holding that number at 30%?
Thomas J. Szkutak
Sure. In terms of our -- we haven’t broken out separately the two segments but the third party business is doing very well in both segments, and so I can’t help you much with the international piece, but just a few data points on our total business, which includes international. 
You mentioned our third party units were actually 30%, which is up from last year, Q1 of last year. Also, our active seller accounts, which includes this globally, we had 8% growth last year Q1. We have 17% growth this quarter, so we are seeing nice active seller growth, and again that’s a global number. And we’ve had several quarters of sequential growth, including growing from Q4. 
So we are seeing a lot of positives from our third party business and as Jeff mentioned a few minutes ago, some of the things we’ve done with Fulfilled by Amazon is also very promising, again to try to make that experience better for both customers and sellers. 
Heath Terry - Credit Suisse
Great. Thank you. 
Operator
We’ll go next to Scott Devitt with Stifel Nicolaus. 
 
Scott Devitt - Stifel Nicolaus
Thank you. Could you talk a little bit about your digital initiatives in your international markets in terms of timing? I understood that you have certain plans within Europe in 2008 and I was wondering if you could add some clarity around that. 
And then separately, just a bigger picture item, your long-term ambitions with payments, the Amazon payment site is live, you’ve launched flexible payments and also done an investment in bill me later, so I would be interested to understand what your longer term plans are there. Thanks. 
Thomas J. Szkutak
Sure. What we did say for international MP3, it will be sometime this year and so we don’t have anything more to add to that. 
In terms of the second part of your question, could you repeat it? It was Scott, right, that had the question?
Scott Devitt - Stifel Nicolaus
The second part is just around your third party payment initiatives with the Amazon payment site that allows the bank account transfers, as well as balances and the flexible payment system, which allows developers to integrate into e-commerce sites and your bill me later investment. I’m trying to understand what your ambitions are with each of those platforms. 
Thomas J. Szkutak
You know, certainly beyond what we have announced, we think these are very interesting initiatives. It is still very early in all of them and we think that we can offer a very good customer experience, which will be for both developers and customers ultimately and we will have to -- you’ll have to stay tuned to see more on those. 
Scott Devitt - Stifel Nicolaus
Thanks. 
Operator
We’ll take our next question from David Joseph with Morgan Stanley.
David Joseph - Morgan Stanley
Thank you. As you’ve increased your revenue guidance for 2008, you’ve also kept your operating income the same. In other words, your guidance for margin came down a little bit. Our sense is that it is a little bit more of the same, you know, lower pricing in international, stronger EGM mix, but also are there -- were there increased expectations for spending as well?
Also, in terms of the economy, it sounds like you are really not -- you are not seeing anything in terms of an impact to consumer spending. I’m just wondering if we can be a little bit even more granular -- if you saw anything during the quarter or even in April related to units per -- related to conversion or even units sold per customer or lower ticket sizes, maybe softness in certain categories that you may have observed that could be related to the economy. Thank you. 
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of the first part of your question about the increase in revenue and operating income, or CSOI, being the same as what it was before, I wouldn’t read much into it. It’s largely unchanged from 90 days ago and -- but in terms of what we are seeing externally, you know we don’t have a lot of data points on the economy. We have certainly a lot of data points on how our business is doing and as you can see from our results in Q1, revenue growth as well as operating margin -- we had strong revenue growth as well as good operating improvements year over year with operating margins up approximately 30 basis points. 
So that’s what we have seen in Q1 and what we think will happen throughout the year has been reflected in the guidance that we gave you today. 
David Joseph - Morgan Stanley
Thank you.

We’ll take our next question from Jeffrey Lindsay with Sanford Bernstein.
Jeffrey Lindsay - Sanford C. Bernstein
We wanted to ask and see if we can get an update if at all possible on sales taxes. Will Amazon be able to cope with collecting sales taxes if obliged to do so by the states, especially New York? 
And then also, if you could, could you give us any update that you can on sales of fresh groceries and wine sales. Is this still a novelty or do you expect to get any traction here?
Thomas J. Szkutak
It would be early to comment on any state activity as it relates to sales taxes, but certainly we do collect sales tax or value-added tax in the states or countries that require us to do so, and we do that activity and approaching 50% of our total business. We do collect some type of sales tax or value-added tax. And we have great businesses in those states and countries that we do do that. 
And the reason why we do is because we are focused on the things that matter to customers, which is making sure that we do have great prices, that we are continuing to expand selections, making sure that we have more and more products in stock and available for immediate shipment. And those are the things that matter to customers. And so that’s what we are going. 
In terms of some of your other questions, in terms of groceries, we have really two things that we do. We have a consumable business today, which is a dry goods business that we are very pleased with. It’s still very early but we think we like what we see so far. The other part is we do have small pilot going on related to fresh groceries. It’s in the Seattle area here locally where we are testing groceries. But beyond that, again it’s just a test that we are doing and we will see how that works out. 
Operator
We’ll take our next question from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. 
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch
A few things -- Jeff, I saw your interview on the Kindle and I could sense the company’s excitement there. Any media sales, either through the Kindle or some of the stuff you are going in music of video, affecting results, either revenues or margins at all at this point?
A second question -- we saw the other revenues really tick up. I think they are going close to 40%. Is that anything to do with web services?
And finally, Tom, could you just remind us what your currency guidance was back in January? I believe it was 400 basis points for the year. At this point, I just want to remind us where it was when you got it in January. Thanks. 
Thomas J. Szkutak
It was 200 basis points in January and now it is 400. 
In terms of digital, we are extremely happy with what we are able to offer customers but certainly we have a considerable base of revenue today, so it is very, very early but we are very pleased with the traction in each of the initiatives that we have out there and apologies for not breaking it out any more detailed than that. 
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch
And then on the other, what drove the growth year over year?
Thomas J. Szkutak
You know, other is a combination of a number of things, including some of our Amazon enterprise services, certainly web services would be a part of that as well, and so again there’s a number of things that are included in that. 
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch
Thank you. 
Operator
We’ll take our next question from Mark Mahaney with Citigroup.
Mark Mahaney - Citigroup
Thank you. Two or three questions, please. The ROIC trend, that 32% clearly up on a year-over-year basis but since it’s a trailing four or five quarters calculation, is there any particular reason why it would have lagged down from the 50% levels or materially higher for the last couple of quarters?
And then secondly, just in terms of the overall revenue mix or product mix, are you seeing any trend, material trend towards purchases of staple items, consumer staple items on your site away from maybe more traditional media entertainment, consumer discretionary items? Thank you. 
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of the first part of your question related to ROIC, what you are seeing is certainly versus last quarter, free cash flow is very strong but wasn’t as strong as it was on a trailing 12-month basis ended 2007, which is certainly a key driver. And a lot of that is just really seasonality associated with our business as it relates to our operating cycle, which you can see. 
In terms of -- can you repeat the second part of your question related to consumables?
Mark Mahaney - Citigroup
Are you seeing amongst the Amazon customer base a shift towards or an increasing of the basket or the bundle as people check out that includes more consumer staple items -- you know, the simple things, the toothpastes, the hair brushes, things like that? Is there something in there that indicates that the increasing wallet share is coming not just from cross-selling media consumer electronics but actually cross-selling consumer staples?
Thomas J. Szkutak
Yeah, there’s not really a lot I can comment on that. Again, what we are seeing though is if you look at our results, you are seeing very broad strong growth across the key sales breakouts that we have, and that’s not just globally. You are seeing it in the individual segments. You are seeing strong media growth as well as EGM in both segments, and so you should be thinking about it that it’s very broad. 
Mark Mahaney - Citigroup
And then one last question; it has to do with any recessionary impact? I know you’ve been kind of asked about this before but just to be clear, is your position that you are not seeing any impact from the recessionary environment in the U.S., either in terms of demand for certain categories, demand for certain price points, or that you are? And if you are, how are you seeing that impact?
Thomas J. Szkutak
Well, what we are seeing is -- you know, you could see at a -- based on the results that we’ve just published in Q1, globally our revenue increased 37%. You see that in both segments excluding the impact of exchange rates, both grew faster than 30%, which is -- which we think is very strong. It was very broad, as I had mentioned. So it’s difficult to say. We don’t have a lot of data points around the economy, so it is difficult to say what is going on there. We are seeing what we see within our business, which is some pretty good strength across categories. 
And again, we think it’s driven by a lot of the things that we talked about earlier. It’s just making sure, continuing to have great low prices, increasing our selection, making sure that we also have in-stock levels where we want them to be. We’ve been improving that a lot over the past few years, and so those are the things that are driving the growth. 
Mark Mahaney - Citigroup
Thanks for the detail, Tom. Thank you.
Operator
We’ll take our next question from Doug Anmuth with Lehman Brothers. 
Doug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers
Thank you for taking my questions. First, media sales have been strong for some time but it looks like there has been a more material deceleration in 1Q in the U.S. Is there anything in particular that you would attribute that too? And then secondly, can you just confirm -- is Audible now a factor into the guidance? Was it factored in three months ago and how much are you expecting from Audible in ’08? Thank you. 
Thomas J. Szkutak
It is factored into our guidance. It was not factored into our guidance 90 days ago and we are not breaking out the detail of what that is for 2008. 
But in terms of our overall growth in media, you know, we are actually pleased with it. I mean, North America is a -- you know, it’s a 20% growth -- excuse me, it was 22% growth, 21% ex FX. If you go back to Q1 last year, it was 21%. So we are still seeing strong growth in international. We also had 22% growth ex exchange. So again, it’s -- we are still very pleased with the growth rates we are seeing there. 
Doug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers
And Tom, can you also just provide some color on the increase in stock-based comp for the year?
Thomas J. Szkutak
Sure. The pieces, we did increase both stock-based compensation and intangibles. Keep in mind that we did have the acquisition of Audible, and so there is a piece of that that’s amortization of intangibles, which is Audible related, and there’s a piece that is stock related. 
Doug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers
Thank you. 
Thomas J. Szkutak
Essentially it’s related to forfeitures on the stock-based comp side, is the largest piece. 
Doug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers
Thank you. 
Operator
We’ll take our next question from Aaron Kessler with Piper Jaffray. 
Aaron Kessler - Piper Jaffray
Just a couple of questions; first, going back to the economy, any sense -- are people changing maybe their average order sizes or any impact you are seeing on larger ticket items? And also, in terms of seasonality throughout the quarter, can you comment at all on how that may have changed? It seems like it got a little slower in March than it was in January and February, so just maybe any commentary on seasonality throughout the quarter. Thank you. 
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of the economy, I’m not sure I can add a lot more to it. We saw what we thought was strong growth in Q1. We thought it was pretty broad-based across categories and we feel good about it. Certainly 31% growth is not the growth that we saw in Q4, 31% ex exchange. It was 37% in Q4. But we are certainly overlapping some pretty good growth rates back in Q1 of last year and despite that, we actually -- if you compare our growth rate in Q1 on a dollar basis or ex exchange, we had an acceleration from Q1 of last year. 
And you could argue that the economic environment at least what I am reading as well as I am sure what you are reading, looks tougher. And so not as strong as Q4 but certainly stronger than we saw in Q1 last year in acceleration. Again, it’s across categories so we feel good and it’s broad-based. 
Aaron Kessler - Piper Jaffray
Just a quick follow-up; revenues seem to be growing much faster than unit growth, where they used to grow closer to in-line. Is that just due to the shift to the electronics and other category or is there another reason for that?
Thomas J. Szkutak
Could you repeat the question again?
Aaron Kessler - Piper Jaffray
Revenues seem to be growing faster than unit growth over the last few quarters, where they used to grow more in-line. So is that just a shift really to the electronics and other category from more BMV? 
Thomas J. Szkutak
I would look -- I would actually make sure you are taking out the impact of exchange when you look at it, because certain exchange is impacting us quite a bit. Again, our growth rate for units this quarter was 31%. Our revenue ex exchange was 31% and again, 37% on a dollar basis. 
Aaron Kessler - Piper Jaffray
Thank you. 
Operator
We’ll take our next question from James Mitchell with Goldman Sachs.
James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs
Thank you very much for taking a couple of questions. First, is it reasonable to assume afar from the jump in unearned revenue that that would to some extent reflect sales of Kindles and Prime payments?
Thomas J. Szkutak
You are breaking up a little bit. Could you repeat the question again, please?
James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs
I’m sorry. If I look at the jump in unearned revenue on the unearned revenue inflows on the cash flow statement, would that reflect sales of Kindle and Prime payments increasing?
Thomas J. Szkutak
It has a number of things that would be included in that, but certainly those elements would be included in there, yes. 
James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs
Okay, and then if I look at the general and admin costs, they seem very well-controlled in the latest quarter. Should we expect that trend to broadly continue going forward? And if it does tick down from roughly 2% to roughly 1% of revenue -- 
Thomas J. Szkutak
You know, we -- it’s been a relatively small percentage of revenue over some time and we are not giving guidance on any particular line items. I’m not sure I can help you much with that one. Apologies. 
James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs
Okay, and then just finally for me on the gross margin trends, if you look internally at gross margin trends within categories, can you provide any color on whether the recent flattening in gross margins year-on-year is due more to priced reductions within categories or to category mix shift from higher gross margin to lower gross margin categories?
Thomas J. Szkutak
The way the dynamics, I guess, of thinking about gross margins, the way I would describe it would be this -- we’re not breaking out individual categories but certainly we are trying to be -- make sure we are as competitive as possible, and that’s on each item, and each of the categories that we have globally. And offsetting that, we certainly are continuing to try to make sure we get good COGS reductions from suppliers. 
You should assume that when we launch new categories that generally, those are lower gross margins. So in other words, we are trying to price our products day one competitive, but we don’t have the buying ability to -- or the scale to buy at certain prices from vendors because we don’t have the volume. But certainly that changes over time. 
And then as these individual categories get more traction, usually there’s a better third party representation of those categories. So I don’t know if that’s helpful. It doesn’t quite answer your question but I think directionally hopefully it does. 
James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs
Thank you. 
Operator
We’ll go next to Brian Pitz with Banc of America Securities. 
Brian Pitz - Banc of America
Thank you. In terms of your guidance, are you factoring in or do you expect any impact from the U.S. economic stimulus plan rebate? And just separately, any comments on why the Kindle remains supply constrained? Thanks. 
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of our guidance, we factored in certainly all things that we can think of that will impact our business, you know, leading up to the call. And so we look at recent trends. We have our categories, provide forecasts of our business globally. We have a number of different models, so all of those things that we try to take into account when we give guidance. 
Jeffrey P. Bezos 
I can comment on the Kindle. The team here has worked incredibly hard since launch to increase the supply chain, to increase manufacturing capacity, and they have done a very good job at that. And just as of a couple of days, Kindle is where we have always wanted it to be, which is in stock. So we are very excited about that. We have worked hard to get Kindle detail page to say Availability: In Stock. 
Brian Pitz - Banc of America
Great. Thanks.

Our final question will come from Steve Weinstein with Pacific Crest. 
Steve Weinstein - Pacific Crest Securities
Great. Thank you very much. This may have been asked a lot of ways but I’ll [ask one more] directly; if I look at your guidance for the full year, if I take into account the changing currency assumptions, the acquisition of Audible, and the upside of the Q1, it looks like you are guiding down revenue for the next three quarters by about 3%. And so I’m wondering if that reflects any change you are seeing in the demand environment or if that reflects tactical changes that Amazon has planned for the rest of the year?
Thomas J. Szkutak
I wouldn’t read too much into it. We have certainly raised our guidance. If you look at the bottom end of the range of our guidance for revenue, it reflects certainly some changes in currency, in the acquisition that you mentioned. And I wouldn’t read too much into it. We still -- the most recent performance that we have is Q1 and we thought we had very strong performance, both on the revenue growth and operating profit standpoint and we feel good about the business. But based on the -- you know, our best forecast for the year, we think the guidance is appropriate. 
Steve Weinstein - Pacific Crest Securities

Good day, everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com fourth quarter 2007 financial results teleconference. (Operator Instructions) For opening remarks, I’ll turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Rob Eldridge. Please go ahead, sir. 
Rob Eldridge 
Hello and welcome to our Q407 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom  Szkutak, our CFO. Jeff Bezos, our founder and CEO, and Tom will both be available for Q&A. 
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management’s views as of today, January 30, 2008 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. 
Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today’s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our 2006 annual report on Form 10-K. 
As you listen to today’s call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. 
During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. 
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2006. 
Now I’ll turn the call over to Tom. 
Thomas J. Szkutak
Thanks, Rob. This was another successful year for Amazon.com. Let me start by reviewing 2007 financial results. 
Free cash flow grew 143% to $1.18 billion. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 435 million shares compared with 436 million shares. 
Return on invested capital was 55%, up from 28%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities over five quarter ends. 
Revenue grew 39% to $14.84 billion, or 35% excluding the $399 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. This was our fastest annual growth rate since 2000. 
North America revenue grew 38% to $8.1 billion and international grew 39% to $6.74 billion. 31% year over year, excluding the year-over-year changes in FX. Additionally, EGM revenue surpassed $3 billion in North America and $2 billion in international for the first time. 
Consolidated segment operating income, or CSOI, grew 70% to $849 million, or 64% excluding $29 million of favorable year over year impact from foreign exchange and operating margin increased 105 basis points to 5.7%. 
GAAP operating income grew 69% to $655 million, or 4.4% of net sales. 
Now I’ll discuss the fourth quarter. Worldwide revenue grew 42% to $5.67 billion, or 37% excluding the $195 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. 
Media revenue increased to $3.33 billion, up 33% or 28% excluding FX. EGM revenue increased to $2.21 billion, up 58% or 54% excluding FX. Worldwide EGM increased to 39% of worldwide sales, up from 35%. Worldwide unit growth was 33%. 
Active customer accounts exceeded 76 million, up 19%. Worldwide active seller accounts were approximately 1.3 million, up 15%. Seller units were 26% of total units versus 25%. 
Worldwide gross profit was $1.17 billion, up 38%. Gross margin decreased 70 basis points to 20.6%, primarily due to lowering prices for customers and change in product mix, partially offset by increases in our seller business. 
Now I’ll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment marketing, tech and content and G&A combined was $842 million, or 14.8% of sales, an improvement of 75 basis points year over year. Tech and content was $190 million, or 3.4% of revenue compared with 4.1%. 
Now I’ll talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. 
In the North America segment, revenue grew 40% to $3.08 billion, outpacing last year’s Q4 growth of 31%. Media revenue grew 31% to $1.64 billion, where we saw increases in all categories. 
EGM revenue grew 53% to $1.34 billion, representing 43% of North America revenues, up from 40%. We saw another quarter of strong sales in electronics, toys and baby, soft goods, which includes jewelry, apparel, shoes, and sporting goods. 
North America gross profit grew 31% to $698 million, and gross margin decreased 143 basis points to 22.6%, driven by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix. 
North America segment operating income increased 25% to $153 million, a 5% operating margin. 
In the international segment, revenue grew 46% to $2.59 billion. Revenue growth was 35% adjusting for the $188 million year-over-year favorable FX impact during the quarter. 
Media revenue grew 36% to $1.69 billion, or 26% excluding FX, and EGM revenue grew 68% to $877 million, or 55% excluding FX. This was the fastest growth rate for international EGM in more than two years. EGM now represents 34% of international revenues, up from 29%. 
International gross profit grew 48% to $472 million, or grew 37% excluding foreign exchange rates, while gross margin increased 32 basis points to 18.2%, reflecting an increase in sales of products by sellers, partially offset by lower end prices to customers, including free shipping and changes in product mix. 
International segment operating income increased 65% to $175 million, a 6.8% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange rates, international operating income increased 49%. CSOI grew 44% to $328 million, or 5.8% of revenue, up six basis points. 
The year-ago quarter included an $8 million insurance recovery benefit in G&A. Excluding this benefit, CSOI for the quarter would have grown 49% and been up 26 basis points. 
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation and other operating expense. 
GAAP operating income grew 38% to $271 million, or 4.8% of net sales. 
Our income tax expense was $74 million in Q4, or a 26% rate for the quarter, which includes a $4 million benefit adjusted to reflect our annual effective tax rate of 28%. In 2007, we paid $24 million in cash taxes. The majority of our tax expense is non-cash because we have current tax benefits and NOLs related to excess stock-based compensation. 
We expect our effective tax rate in 2008 to be approximately 30% and we estimate cash taxes paid to be less than $75 million. However, there is potential for significant volatility due to several factors, including variability in accurately predicting the amount and mix of taxable income by jurisdiction and business acquisitions or investments. 
We are endeavoring to optimize our global taxes on a cash paid basis, not for tax expense on a financial reporting basis.
GAAP net income was $207 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, compared with $98 million and $0.23 per diluted share. 
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $1.2 billion to $3.31 billion. In Q107, we repurchases $248 million of our common stock, or 6 million shares. 
Inventory increased 27% to $1.2 billion and inventory turns were flat at 12.7, even as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels across product categories and geographies, and introduced new product categories. 
Our investment in net fixed assets increased $86 million from a year ago to $543 million. Our 2007 capital expenditures were $224 million. 
I’ll conclude my portion of today’s call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we’ve seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. 
However, there is a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It is not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as marking our Euro-denominated debt to market quarterly, inter-company balances and foreign currencies that settle amongst subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. 
Our guidance assumes that we don’t record any additional intangibles, any further revisions to stock-based compensation, or our restructuring related estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they’ve been recently. 
For Q1, we expect net sales of between $3.95 billion and $4.15 billion, a growth of between 31% and 38%. This guidance anticipates approximately 500 basis points of positive impact of foreign exchange. 
GAAP operating income to be between $155 million and $200 million, or between 7% growth and 38% growth. This includes approximately $55 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. 
We anticipate consolidated segment income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $210 million and $255 million, or between 17% growth and 42% growth. 
For calendar 2008, we expect net sales of between $18.75 billion and $19.75 billion, a growth of between 26% and 33%. This guidance anticipates greater than 200 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. 
GAAP operating income to be between $785 million and $985 million, or between 20% growth and 50% growth. This includes approximately $240 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate 2008 consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $1.025 billion and $1.225 billion, or between 21% growth and 44% growth. 
We intend to continue to get operating leverage during 2008 with CSOI growing faster than revenue on a percentage basis.
We anticipate our free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to our operating profit growth rate over time, with some variability, including some changes in working capital and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. 
We expect capital expenditures, including capitalized software development costs, to be approximately $300 million. 
We will continue to strive for year-over-year annual growth in free cash flow and free cash flow per share while investing in our long-term opportunities. We are confident that if we continue to improve customer experience and execute efficiently, our value proposition as well as our free cash flow will expand. 
Thanks, and with that, Rob, let’s move to questions. 
Rob Eldridge 
Great. Thanks, Tom. Let’s move on to the Q&A portion of the call with Jeff and Tom. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?
Question-and-Answer Session

Operator
(Operator Instructions)  We’ll go first to Brian Pitz with Banc of America. 
Brian Pitz - Banc of America
I think the question on everyone’s mind is how should we begin to conceptualize the 20 basis points of margin expansion that’s at the midpoint of your guidance for 2008, despite a really significant year-over-year revenue increase? It would seem as if you should be able to drive somewhat better margins, given this type of growth. What’s driving this -- is it prime, higher overall cost of shipping? Any additional color would be really helpful. Thanks. 
Thomas J. Szkutak
Sure. We’ve given a -- in terms of the guidance that we’ve given for the total year, you have a range certainly in terms of implied operating margins. If you take the low end of the guidance from a CSOI perspective and the high end, it’s a range of 5.5% to 6.2%, and that compares to 5.7% in 2007, so again it’s a range. 
But certainly as you think about our business in 2008, you know, we are going to do more of the same that we did in 2007. We are going to make sure that we focus on the customer experience, which includes making sure that we have great prices across all of our categories and geographies, and you saw that reflected in our Q4 results. We are going to continue to make sure that we have increased selection, have great in-stock levels, so all of those things are included in the guidance that we’ve given. 
And we are going obviously still continue to invest appropriately, which is reflected in the guidance. 
The other aspect that you see, because you see an effect that’s essentially flat operating margins in Q4 and certainly one of the bigger drivers of that is the gross margin year-over-year decline. And with the great growth rate that we saw in Q4, when that happens, good things happen to us and what I mean by that, there’s an opportunity to go to and work with our supplier base, our vendors, to get even better prices. So that’s something that is certainly an opportunity for us and with the broad breadth of growth that we had across categories in all of our geographies, it’s clearly an opportunity for us. 
Brian Pitz - Banc of America
Great, thanks. 
Operator
We’ll take our next question from Heath Terry with Credit Suisse. 
Heath Terry - Credit Suisse
Thank you. Just to follow-up on what Brian was asking, how does this affect and to what extent does it affect the long-term margin guidance that you’ve given of being able to get to 10% margins in the business?
And as you continue to take the incremental profit dollar that you are getting and file them into top line to drive growth, at what point do you allow some of that margin, or how do you think about timing, the allowance of some of that margin to actually flow to the bottom line? Or is this going to be an ongoing process and we see 6% forever?
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of our expectation, nothing has changed. What we’ve said in the past is we think that double-digit operating margins are possible but what we are really focused on is driving free cash flow and free cash flow per share, as you can see that evidence in our 2007 results, total year as well as Q4. 
And so again, nothing has changed. We’ve also said that we think double-digits is possible but if a high-single-digit operating margin is the right thing to drive free cash flow, that’s what we’ll do. 
So if you look at our Q4 results, and take a look at it, you saw very strong growth, you saw operating margins that were flat year over year but still strong operating profit growth, and then free cash flow was more than doubled year over year. 
So again, we’re focused on driving free cash flow per share. It’s certainly our intention to improve operating leverage during 2008 and over time, we think that we can improve our operating margins as well. 
Heath Terry - Credit Suisse
Great. Thank you.

We’ll take our next question from Scott Devitt with Stifel Nicolaus. 
Scott Devitt - Stifel Nicolaus
Thank you. Just on this same subject, but a little bit more detailed -- the international gross margin in the quarter on a year-over-year basis was actually up, and so the decline was in the domestic margins, so there were a lot of moving parts in your gross margin numbers related to these volume price trade-offs that you talk about but also the product mix in the direct business and then the benefit from third-party sales. 
So I was just wondering if you could talk about whether third-party mix is becoming a less relevant driver of gross margin in the domestic business and so possibly pricing decisions and the mix shift toward EGM and the direct business is maybe what’s pressuring the domestic gross margin? Thank you. 
Thomas J. Szkutak
Our seller business globally is very strong. We are continuing to try to work on that experience for sellers to make it even better. Certainly our goal is to have sellers increase their sales on our platform and so we continue to do a number of different things to make it easier for them to sell, including FBA. 
And so again, we are pleased with our seller business and -- I don’t know if that answers your question. Did you have a -- was there a second part?
Scott Devitt - Stifel Nicolaus
The second part is I’m just wondering how much the mix shift towards EGM, which I believe is lower margin than the historical BMV direct business, if that’s driving the domestic margins down a bit, the mix shift. 
Thomas J. Szkutak
I would probably describe the margin structure more like this -- we have, and this is globally, we’ve entered into a lot of new categories over the past few years and when we enter those new categories, we’re pricing very competitively day one, making sure we upgrade prices for customers. And it takes us a while to get the scale in those individual categories in those geographies, so when that happens, certainly you should expect that very often times when we have a newer category, that those are lower gross margins and then, as we get the scale and those individual categories, good things happen. We get more traffic, which helps our third party business. It also helps us get better prices with our suppliers. 
And so that’s one of the reasons why we are excited about what we have seen throughout the course of 2007 and in Q4, is that we’ve gotten great growth and now the opportunity that we have in front of us is how do we work better with, even more closely with suppliers to get better prices. And that’s something that’s not an immediate thing. It’s just something that evolves over time as we continue to grow, so it’s a good opportunity for us. 
Operator
We’ll take our next question from Mark Mahaney with Citigroup. 
Mark Mahaney - Citigroup
Thank you. Two questions -- first, a top line question; are you seeing any signs of consumer softness in spending? You organically showed revenue growth acceleration. It seemed to fly in the face of what most in-store retailers are seeing, obviously there’s secular growth on the Internet but are you seeing anything perhaps in the March quarter that indicates softness, or maybe a mix shift to lower priced products?
And then secondly, a quick question for you, Jeff; last quarter you said that you didn’t think R&D cycles going forward would have the same step function impact on margins that they had between ’04 and ’06. Is any of the ’08 guidance, is there an implication in there that there’s another major R&D cycle coming? Thank you. 
Thomas J. Szkutak
Sure. In terms of the economic piece, as you can see from our results, our business is fine, so we really can’t add much in terms of the economic piece. 
Jeffrey P. Bezos
And then to your second question, I think what you are referring to is that we’ve said over the last year or so that we expect to grow into the fixed expense that we very deliberately built in 2005 and the first part of 2006. And our intention at this point is to continue to demonstrate to ourselves this business model. So as Tom said, we intend to continue to get operating leverage during 2008 with CSOI growing faster than revenue on a percentage basis. 
Thomas J. Szkutak
And along with that, as it relates to technology and content, we certainly would expect the technology and content growth to be somewhat less than revenue growth for 2008. 

Jeffrey P. Bezos 
And we believe we can do that, with respect to the step function part of your question, we believe we can do that while continuing to make investments in our digital businesses and Amazon Kindle, and new category expansion, continue to invest in China as we are doing, fulfillment by Amazon in our seller business. We have our Amazon web services business is another area of investment for us. 
So when we look at -- that’s what we mean by not necessarily having to take the same kind of step function increase that you saw in 2005 and the first part of 2006. 
Operator
We’ll take our next question from David Joseph with Morgan Stanley.
David Joseph - Morgan Stanley
Thank you for taking my question. It seems that you saw active customers accelerate again and active revenue per customer accelerate as well as units accelerate yet again 33% year over year, and our guess, our ongoing assumption is that a lot of this is coming through Amazon Prime, not only because that’s where you have free shipping but that’s also where one-click shopping is merchandised pretty effectively. 
I’m just wondering if you can give us a little bit of color in terms of where this incremental growth is coming from, where the acquisition, where the activity is coming from. Is it really coming through Amazon Prime mainly or is there something else that we might be missing here?
Also, in terms of the Kindle, can you give us an idea of what we can be expecting from that in 2008? Not necessarily -- I mean, if you can provide any kind of information in terms of units or revenue growth but also what can we expect in terms of the margin? Should we expect some pressure to Amazon’s margins from the Kindle? Thank you. 
Thomas J. Szkutak
The growth that we are seeing is broad-based. It’s coming from different geographies, different categories, different service offerings. So it’s not any one particular thing. Certainly Amazon Prime is a component of it. It continues to be a successful program. 
One of the reasons that fulfillment by Amazon is an important program for our seller customers is that it drives -- the number one thing that sellers want is sales and fulfillment by Amazon drives sales for sellers, so when a seller switches to fulfillment by Amazon, their sales increase. 
And one of the reasons for that is that those items, those third-party items immediately become eligible for Amazon Prime, so Prime members can use their Amazon Prime memberships to buy third-party items as soon as that seller joins fulfillment by Amazon. And we shipped half a million items in the fourth quarter on behalf of third-party sellers through fulfillment by Amazon, so we are very excited about that investment. 
David Joseph - Morgan Stanley
Can you give us a little color on the Kindle?
Jeffrey P. Bezos 
Yeah, Kindle is, in terms of demand, is outpacing our expectations, which is certainly something that we are very grateful for. It’s also on the manufacturing side causing us to scramble. We’re working very hard to increase the number of units that we can build and supply per week, so that we can get back -- our goal is to get into a situation as quickly as we can where when you order a Kindle, we ship it immediately. That’s the standard we want to hold ourselves to and we are working very hard to get there. We are super-excited by the very strong demand. 
David Joseph - Morgan Stanley
Thank you. 
Operator
We’ll take our next question from Jeetil Patel with Deutsche Bank. 
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank
Great. A couple of questions, guys; user and unit growth accelerated again. Can you just talk about how much of this improvement is being driven by I guess price elasticity that’s utilizing on your retail business versus newer services such as third party out there, or initiatives such as Prime?
And the second question on Kindle, it looks like there is a lot of internal components from a build standpoint. It seems to be quite rich from a feature set standpoint. Are there capabilities that have yet to be turned on beyond just the e-book reader and browser functionality inside the Kindle at this point?
Jeffrey P. Bezos 
Well, the Kindle has a few experimental features that are -- some of which are visible on the Kindle. It has something call a Now-Now, where you can type in any question and using the Mechanical Turk in the background, which is one of our web services, that question gets answered and the answer to the question gets displayed on the Kindle. 
There is an experimental web browser on the Kindle, which is actually, for a mobile device, a pretty good web browser, and of course is has the Whisper Net EVDO connectivity, which gives you broadband wireless access to that web browser. 
So there are a number of experimental features and we’ve put those on there and made them accessible to customers so that these early Kindle users can tell us what they think of those features, whether we should continue to invest in them, continue to work on them and make them part of the product. 
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of the first part of your question related to the growth in units, as I had mentioned, the third party or the seller percentage grew year over year, so seller units were growing at a faster rate. And that goes back to some of the comments Jeff just made a minute ago about what we are doing to improve the seller experience. 
And then on the retail side, it’s a lot of the things that we’ve been talking about. It’s -- again, the focus areas are value proposition, making sure we have great prices for customers, selection, convenience, and in-stock levels. 
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank
Do you think it’s actually the retail business and your pricing that’s helping to accelerate the unit growth and user growth? Or do you think it is more on the third party selection side?
Thomas J. Szkutak
Well again, both are very strong and certainly pricing is a key, but there’s a lot of other key factors, including Prime, where customers are getting an increased share of wallet, and a number of different factors. The fact that some customers come to our website now, more is in stock than it was 12 months ago or 24 months ago. So when that happens, certainly there’s a benefit from doing that, as well as a lot of the other things that we talked about. 
So it’s selection -- 
Jeffrey P. Bezos 
It’s selection expansion. 
Thomas J. Szkutak
Selection expansion, exactly. So it’s very -- it’s a lot of the things that we’ve been talking about really over the past several years but we have continued to be focused on them and it’s showing up in our top line. 
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank
If I may ask just a quick follow-up, I guess the longer term theme at Amazon has been that you would use price as a way to drive growth in the business and the idea was that you could always lower price because of the cost advantages that you have and the efficiencies that  you are getting from economies of scale. 
Are you at a point now vis-à-vis retail that you can drive prices lower and it’s helping to accelerate the growth and you can always use that lever to control the growth of your overall business as a whole? Or do you think it’s still going to take maybe a couple more years to have that type of capability relative to I guess the retail formula, which is prices will tend to go higher in general because of the inflationary aspect of retail and real estate?
Jeffrey P. Bezos 
I’m not sure if this directly answers your question or not -- I think it does but one of the things that’s clearly the case and we’ve observed it over a number of years now is that in certain categories, we are seeing less elasticity from price reductions and that’s something that you would expect to see happen because there’s -- price elasticity curves are not linear. There’s a kind of an elbow in the curve right around where competitive prices are, so you see a lot of elasticity as you lower prices to meet competitive pricing and you don’t see very much elasticity if you go below competitive pricing. 
So our focus has always been to be extremely competitive and to get really operationally great at that, so that our pricing is very, very sharp and we are always giving customers the best possible deal. 
And at the same time, because we have the scale to have a very efficient cost structure, to be able to do that in a sustainable way that’s healthy for the business. And you can have a very nice fly wheel there where the scale of the company increases, which allows us to be more efficient, to make better use of both our fixed costs and to do more to drive down variable costs, including as Tom mentioned in some of our newer categories where we haven’t been operating as long, we’re still getting to know the vendors in those categories, getting to know our suppliers, figuring out how to work most efficiently with them and we’ll continue to do that. 
So there are big opportunities and for us, the way we look at this is lowering prices is easy -- being able to afford to lower prices is what’s difficult and we’ve been working on that for many, many years now and we expect to continue to work on it for our entire corporate existence. 
And we know of lots of opportunities to improve our fixed costs, to improve our variable costs, and to improve our COGS through working together with our supplier base. And those opportunities exist in even our -- even the categories that we’ve been doing business in the longest. We still have opportunities in there. 
In our newer categories, we have a lot of low-hanging fruit. There’s more obvious pieces just because they are newer and we haven’t done as much in those areas. 
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank
Crystal clear. Thanks.

We’ll go next to Robert Peck with Bear Stearns. 
Robert Peck - Bear Stearns
Just a quick question, two parts, on guidance going forward -- eBay made some announcements the other day regarding changes to its platform, which is hoping to sort of bring back some of the third party sellers. Is your current guidance right now accounting for any sort of impact by eBay or do you think there will be any impact by eBay? And then I’ve got one follow-up. 
Thomas J. Szkutak
We have a longstanding practice of not talking about any specific company but as it relates to our business, we have been and continue to be in a very competitive environment. And that’s both online and offline, and that’s not anything new. It’s something that we’ve been operating in for quite some time and the way we address that is we focus on the customer, and we have a number of different customers. We have certainly our direct customer that we are always trying to make sure we improve that experience. We have our sellers, which we view as partners and customers and we’re trying to improve that experience as well, and Jeff gave some great examples of that, as well as our developers. 
And so we are kind of heads down, focused on improving customer experience and that’s what we have been doing and that’s what we plan on doing going forward?
Robert Peck - Bear Stearns
If you started to see an impact, would you think about reducing your take rate for third-party sellers?
Thomas J. Szkutak
I would just say that this is such an intensely competitive environment and it has been from the very beginning, and we have lots of competitors. So it’s -- for us, the way we think about our seller business, the business you are asking about, is we think of our sellers as a customer set. We try to figure out what they want and we try to figure out how to give it to them. 
We know that the number one thing that sellers want is sales. We also know that these -- the market that we operate in, and we are very grateful for this fact, is a very, very large one and in our view, and we’ve always said this, and I don’t think it’s going to change, is that there’s room for lots of winners. 
We have a strategy that we are very, very focused on. We’re not changing it. We like our strategy and we are just going to stay heads down. One of the great examples I can give you for trying to drive sales for sellers is the combination of fulfillment by Amazon and Amazon Prime. 
I talked about this just a couple of minutes ago but it’s a very good combination for sellers and as sellers continue to sign up for fulfillment by Amazon and as our buyer customers continue to sign up for Amazon Prime, that combination is going to be very good for our buyer customers and it’s going to be very good for our seller customers as well, and we love that. 
Robert Peck - Bear Stearns
Just a quick follow-up on guidance here. Could you talk a little bit about your Borders relationship and if your guidance in 2008 accounts for any change there?
Thomas J. Szkutak
Sure. The relationship that we have is reflected in the guidance for 2008. 
Operator
We’ll take our next question from Imran Khan with J.P. Morgan.
Imran Khan - J.P. Morgan
Thank you for taking my questions. Two questions, number one; I was trying to get a better sense about what kind of adoption you are seeing for prime in the international market -- is it similar to U.S., better than U.S. or weaker than U.S.? Any color would be very helpful. 
Secondly, international gross profit margin is still substantially lower than the U.S. gross profit margins. How should we think about that difference to narrow over time?
Thomas J. Szkutak
Sure. In terms of international prime, you know, it’s -- we are very excited with what we are seeing in each of the countries. It’s very early but we like what we see and we are going to continue to look at all the associated metrics for that program, but we are very pleased to be able to offer it to customers and we like what we see so far. 
In terms of the gross margins, you are right that our gross margins in international are less than North America. Keep in mind that certainly our international segment has a number of different countries and again, there’s nothing really structurally different between the two segments, if you will, and so there’s really opportunities to improve those margins over time. 
What we have said in the past is certainly our seller business, if you will, we are pleased with globally but we have certainly a bigger penetration in our North America segment than we do in international, so that’s an opportunity for us. It’s an opportunity in both segments, if you will, but certainly we’re pleased with what we see there. 
Again, if you think about also in international, if you look back we’ve launched many new categories over the past year, the past few years and again it goes back to some of my comments at the start of the call. As those categories get larger and we get more traffic to those categories, it helps the third party business. It also helps from an opportunity to work closely with suppliers to get better, to work better with them to improve those prices as well. 
So again, that’s the -- that’s certainly what we are working on and that’s what you are seeing in our results. 
Imran Khan - J.P. Morgan
If I may ask a follow-up question about the category expansion, I think you talked about, as you continue to grow faster than the broader market, you will have better power with the seller suppliers in terms of improving your gross profit margins. As you continue to expand your category and some of the categories are lower margins than your core media business, do you think you can still maintain the kind of margins that you had in 2007 or 2006?
Jeffrey P. Bezos 
We have a wide range of categories. When we enter a new category, we’re focused on first, is it something that we think we can serve customers well in, something that we can add a lot of value to customers, and also do we think we can generate a lot of free cash flow. 
We certainly do look at a lot of different characteristics of those categories before entering them, but there certainly are categories, an example would be you know, the diamonds within the jewelry category. That’s something where you know it’s possible to have lower gross margins but have very high contribution profit per unit, for example. 
So first we are optimizing for, from an investor standpoint, for free cash flow and free cash flow per share, and the way we do that is by improving the customer experience. So again, it’s a -- we’ve have a mix of different categories, some of which will have higher gross margins and lower gross margins, but our goal is again to maximize free cash flow per share over the long term. 
Imran Khan - J.P. Morgan
Thank you.

We’ll go next to Jennifer Watson with Goldman Sachs. 
Jennifer Watson - Goldman Sachs
Thank you. Can you give us some details on the order frequency of Prime users since the introduction of the service, and if incremental prime members are ordering as frequently as the early adopters?
Thomas J. Szkutak
There’s not a lot of data I can share with you except that certainly Prime customers are buying more and we are getting an increased share of wallet. They are buying in more categories, so there’s a lot of cross shopping that is going on and that’s something that we saw early on when we started Prime and it’s something we continue to see with existing and new customers. 
Jennifer Watson - Goldman Sachs
Great, and can you give any sort of indication on renewal rates of prime memberships?
Thomas J. Szkutak
Other than it’s very good. We’re not disclosing numbers but the renewal rates are very good, very strong. 
Jennifer Watson - Goldman Sachs
Thank you. 
Operator
We’ll take our next question from Doug Anmuth with Lehman Brothers. 
Doug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers
Thank you. I have two questions. First, can you tell us what is driving your projected 34% increase in CapEx spending in 2008 and how should we think about your free cash flow growth specifically this year?
And then secondly, it looks like you added 1,200 employees during the fourth quarter. What’s the delta there versus the 600 that you added in 4Q06 in terms of the composition of employees? Thank you. 
Thomas J. Szkutak
Sure. In terms of the -- I’ll take the employee one first. You know, we did increase our employee base. The largest portion of that was certainly in our operations and fulfillment area, with the growth that we experienced throughout 2007, as well as what you were seeing in Q4. We certainly improved, increased our staffing level to support that. 
In terms of CapEx, I think you should probably take a look at it versus the incremental revenue that you are seeing and again, it’s in support of our overall business as we grow, so that’s what we are looking at. 
Doug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers
Any commentary on what you could grow free cash flow in ’08?
Thomas J. Szkutak
We have traditionally not given guidance on free cash flow but again, over time, we certainly see that operating profit as well as some adjustments for working capital tracks pretty nicely. But again, we’re not giving specific guidance for 2008 free cash flow. 
Doug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers
Okay, great. Thank you. 
Operator
We’ll go next to Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch
A couple of questions about your outlook, which I think most people are wondering about. First, it looks like revenue is higher than a lot of people were thinking, but maybe margins lower. Do you anticipate any changes in the mix between third party units and your own units? And then secondly, does your outlook give you room to accelerate either new category launches internationally next year, or new countries or fulfillment centers? What kind of flexibility have you built in there?
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of the guidance that we have for 2008 reflects our best view of what’s going to happen in 2008 and as we talked about earlier, we are still investing, going to continue to invest in the business, as Jeff highlighted a number of key areas. But as part of that, we expect it to be appropriate growth in terms of technology and content. 
And in terms of some of the other things that you mentioned, you should expect that we’re going to expand capacity as we have over the past few years to fulfill the demand for the range of guidance that we’ve given. You should also expect us to launch new categories as well during 2008. 
So those are things that we are going to continue to focus on. In addition to launching new categories, you should expect us to increase selection on our existing categories in each of our geographies. 
So those are things that we’ll continue to work on to make that experience better for customers. 
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch
And how about that first part, third part ratio? Do you expect that to change much next year?
Thomas J. Szkutak
We’re not giving guidance on what the mix will look like and ultimately, and this is both from 2008 and really any year,  we view that nothing has changed and we’ve said this consistently. Ultimately the customer will decide where the mix ends up and that’s both in the current year and long-term. 
What we are focused on is making sure that the experience is great for our various customer sets and we do that. We think we have nice opportunities to grow both our seller business as well as our retail business, along with our other customer set as well. 
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch
Last question -- the other U.S. revenues were up $30 million year over year. It looks like some nice growth there -- is that a positive lever for margin, gross margins? And what’s really driving that growth?
Thomas J. Szkutak
We haven’t split up the margins of other but certainly we’ve got a number of things going into other that are Amazon Enterprise Solutions business, as we’ve talked about in the past. We’ve launched a number of new merchants, which is certainly helpful. Web services as well, so again, it’s a number of different components of that.
We also have various marketing arrangements. Sometimes it’s higher or lower, depending upon the period. So again, there’s a number of different things that are going into that line item. 
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch
Thank you.
Operator
And our final question today will come from Aaron Kessler with Piper Jaffray.
Aaron Kessler - Piper Jaffray
A couple of questions; first, the marketing costs were up slightly on a year-over-year basis as a percent of revenues. I just want to see if there is anything specific to that, and then one follow-up question. 
Thomas J. Szkutak
The marketing has been, over the past several years, actually in a pretty tight band as a percentage of revenue and it continues to try to make sure that we make that spend more efficient, so there is nothing -- I don’t think there’s anything unusual with it. 
Aaron Kessler - Piper Jaffray
Great, and then in terms of -- maybe a question for Jeff; in terms of your expectation for the digital media business, obviously a lot of traditional media in terms of books, music, movies is going more toward a download basis and you are clearly getting prepared for that day when you see more of that shift happening. Any sense for when you really start to see more of that shift happen and what you think the impact will be on your business? I guess how much can you offset the lower traditional media sales with your increased digital sales would be the question?
Jeffrey P. Bezos 
Long term, we are very optimistic about that because when media are physical products, it makes a lot of sense for a large majority of those sales to happen in the physical world. But as media becomes digital and downloaded and sent around wirelessly, et cetera, et cetera, it doesn’t make so much sense to buy those in the physical world. 
And so our relative advantage relative to where the bulk of the sales are today, the bulk of the sales today are of course in the physical world, so our relative advantage over time should improve relative to the physical world. 
So we’re very -- in sort of the long term, very excited about it. 
Aaron Kessler - Piper Jaffray
Great. Thank you. 
Rob Eldridge

Good day, everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com third quarter2007 financial results teleconference. (Operator Instructions)  For opening remarks, I will be turning thecall over to the Director of Investor Relations, Ms. Kim Nelson. Please goahead.
Kim Nelson
Hello and welcome to our Q3 2007 financial resultsconference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. Jeff Bezos, ourfounder and CEO, and Tom will both be available for Q&A.
The following discussion and responses to your questionsreflect management's views as of today October 23, 2007 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actualresults may differ materially. Additional information about factors that couldpotentially impact our financial results is included in today's press releaseand our filings with the SEC, including our 2006 annual report on Form 10-K.
As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have ourpress release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well asmetrics and commentary on the quarter. 
During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financialmeasures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and ourfilings with the SEC -- each of which is posted on our IR website -- you willfind additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, includingreconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons on thiscall will be against our results for the comparable period of 2006.
Now I will turn the call over to Tom.
Tom Szkutak
Thanks, Kim. I'll begin with comments on our financialresults. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased 118% to $800 million, whilethe combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding wasunchanged from a year ago at $435 million. Worldwide revenue grew 41% to $3.26billion, or 38% excluding the $75 million favorable impact from foreignexchange. Q3 2007 revenue benefited by approximately 290 basis points ofyear-over-year growth from Harry Potter VII sales, plus attachments. 
Media revenue increased to $2.09 billion, up 36%, or 32%excluding FX. EGM revenue increased to $1.08 billion, up 54% or 51% excludingFX. EGM accounted for 33% of worldwide sales in Q3 2007, up from 30% for thesame period last year. Our worldwide unit growth was 32%, and active customeraccounts exceeded 72 million, up 17% year over year. 
Worldwide gross profit was $762 million, up 39%. Grossmargin decreased 45 basis points to 23.4%, primarily due to lowering prices andchange in product mix partially offset by increases in our third-partybusiness. Worldwide active seller accounts were over 1.2 million, and third partyunits were 32% of total units versus 30% in the prior year. 
Amazon Prime memberships more than doubled year over year.
Now I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock-basedcompensation. Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content and G&A combined was$585 million, or 18% of sales, an improvement of 273 basis points year overyear. Fulfillment was $285 million or 8.7% of net sales, down 31 basis pointsyear over year. During the quarter, we opened new fulfillment centers in Phoenix, Arizona and Saran, France.
Technology and content was $181 million, or 5.6% of netsales, an improvement of 122 basis points year over year, as we continue togrow into our new level of spending. Marketing was $72 million or 2.2% of netsales, an improvement of 51 basis points year over year. In recent years, ourmarketing spend has been between 2.2% to 2.7% of net sales.
Now I'll talk about our segment results, and consistent withprior periods, we do not allocate the segments or stock-based compensation orother operating expense line items. 
In the North America segment, revenuegrew 42% to $1.79 billion. This is the highest growth rate in seven years.Media revenue grew 38% to $1.08 billion. EGM revenue grew 54% to $631 million,representing 35% of North American revenues, up from 33%. We saw anotherquarter of strong sales in electronics, toys and baby, and soft goods whichincludes jewelry, apparel, shoes and sporting goods. North American gross profitgrew 34% to $460 million, and gross margin decreased 159 basis points to 25.7%,primarily due to lower prices and changes in product mix. North Americansegment operating income increased 263% to $79 million, a 4.4% operatingmargin. 
In the international segment, revenue was $1.47 billion, up40% or 33% adjusted for the $72 million favorable foreign exchange impact. Mediarevenue grew 33% to $1.01 billion or 27% excluding FX. EGM revenue grew 54% to$448 million or 45% excluding foreign exchange. International gross profit grew47% to $302 million, or 39% excluding FX, while gross margin increased 88 basispoints to 20.5%, reflecting the increase in third party mix, partially offsetby lower prices and changes in product mix. International segment operatingincome increased 94% to $98 million or 6.6% operating margin. Excluding the $5million favorable impact from FX, international operating income increased 81%.
CSOI grew 145% to $177 million or 5.4% of net sales, up 228basis points year over year. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includesstock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operatingincome grew 207% to $123 million or 3.8% of net sales.
Our provision for income taxes was $44 million in Q3 or a35% rate for the quarter, which includes an $8 million year-to-date adjustmentto reflect our current estimate of our annual effective tax rate of 29%, whichincorporates our strong North America growth. 
As a reminder, there is potential for significant volatilityof our effective tax rate due to several factors, including variability inaccurately predicting the amount and mix of taxable income by jurisdiction. In2007, we anticipate cash paid for income taxes will be approximately $25million, compared to $15 million in 2006, as we continue to benefit from NOLsinside the United States.NOL utilization is impacted by many factors, including our excess stock-basedcompensation deductions.
GAAP net income was $80 million or $0.19 per diluted share,compared with $19 million and $0.05 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securitieswere $1.91 billion, an increase of $690 million year over year. Inventoryincreased 32% to $970 million, and inventory turns decreased from 13.2 a year ago to 12.4 as we expandedselection, improved in-stock levels across product categories and geographiesand introduced new product categories. 
Our investment in net fixed assets, which includes netcapitalized software development costs, increased $42 million from a year agoto $491 million. Our return on invested capital was 42%. ROIC is TTM-free cashflow divided by average total assets minus average current liabilities.
I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance.Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to-dateand what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions.However, there is a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange ratefluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's notpossible to accurately predict demand and therefore, our actual results coulddiffer materially from our guidance.
As we described in more detail in our public filings, issuessuch as marking our euro-denominated debt to market quarterly, intra-companybalances in foreign currencies that settle amongst our subsidiaries,unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax ratecan all have a material effect on guidance. 
Our guidance assumes that we don't record any additional intangibleassets or any further revisions to stock-based compensation or ourrestructuring-related estimates, and that FX rates remain approximately wherethey have been recently.
For Q4 we expect net sales of between $5.1 billion and $5.45billion, or growth of between 28% and 37%. This guidance anticipates greaterthan 300 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. 
GAAP operating income to be between $221 million and $291million, or grow between 12% and 48%. This includes $54 million primarily forstock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. 
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, whichexcludes stock-based compensation and other operating expenses, to be between$275 million and $345 million, or grow between 20% and 51%.
For calendar year 2007 we expect net sales of between$14.263 billion and $14.613 billion, or growth of between 33% and 36%. Thisguidance anticipates greater than 300 basis points of positive impact from foreignexchange rates. 
GAAP operating income to be between $605 million and $675million, or growth of between 56% and 74%. This includes $191 million primarilyfor stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. 
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, whichexcludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between$796 million and $866 million, or grow between 59% and 73%.
We anticipate our 2007 free cash flow growth rate to trendsimilar to our operating profit growth rate year over year, with somevariability from changes to working capital. We expect capital expenditures,including capitalized software development costs, to be approximately $250million. 
We will continue to strive for year-over-year annual growthof free cash flow and free cash flow per share, while investing in ourlong-term opportunities. We are confident that if we continue to improvecustomer experience and execute efficiently, our value proposition, as well asour free cash flow, will expand.
Thanks. With that, let's move to questions.
Kim Nelson
Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion ofthe call with Jeff and Tom. Operator, will you please remind our listeners howto initiate a question?
Question-and-AnswerSession
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes fromJeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank.
Jeetil Patel  - Deutsche Bank
Looking at the -- call it almost 11 million -- new activecustomers you've had in the past year, can you discuss their purchase frequencyor if they are buying from you just as voraciously as the previous set ofactive customers? What's driving the accelerated growth across the board?
Second, can you talk about the broader impact of lowerconsumer spending you're seeing in your business? Are you seeing any effect, ordo you think that perhaps the online side is a little bit more immune to it,given that it seems to be more about pricing as a big driver of why folks buyonline, in addition to convenience and other factors?
Tom Szkutak
Jeetil, I'll take the second half of the question first. Interms of the impact of consumer spending, I think what you're seeing for us,and we're certainly not a bellwether for the economy, but what you're seeing iscustomers reacting and responding to just a very good customer experience:continued focus on lower prices, increased selection and certainly, speed ofdelivery with Prime being a factor. We think that plays well, as reflected inour guidance for Q4 as we enter into the holiday season. The customer is reallygoing to get a great customer experience again in Q4, as they did in Q3.
The first part of your question, we haven't broken out anyparticular details on active customers beyond what we mentioned earlier in thecomments. So I really can't help you much with that one.
Jeetil Patel  - Deutsche Bank
Do you think it's more driven by selection that you'reseeing the accelerated growth, or do you think it's actually more just thecustomer/consumer reaction? Thanks.
Tom Szkutak
 Again, as Imentioned, it's a combination of increased selection. We've increased selectionin the categories we're in, going much deeper. We've added new categories overtime, as you've seen. We continue to get even sharper on pricing, and those arethings that we have a constant focus on. We also want to make sure thatinventory is there, so that we can get it to customers very fast, which you cansee reflected in our turns. So all of those things we spend a lot of time on,and that certainly impacts the customer experience. That is reflected in thegrowth rates that you've seen in Q3.
Operator
Your next question comes from Anthony Noto - Goldman Sachs.
Anthony Noto  - Goldman Sachs
Tom, after an extended period of investment, you have nowgone to a period of obviously being able to grow into your expenses and drivevery high incremental margins. I was wondering as you look into 2008, would youcharacterize that as another year of growing into your expenses and drivingcontinued margin expansion? Or is it a year in which you may have more balancedinvestment versus improved profitability?
I have a follow-up question for Jeff on the consumer as itrelates to online behavior. Thanks.
Tom Szkutak
Unfortunately, we're not giving guidance on 2008 today.Consistent with what we've done over the last couple of years, we'll be givingguidance on our next call after our Q4 earnings. But as it relates totechnology and content spending, roughly 15 or 18 months ago, we certainlytalked about the fact that we had spent the previous two to two-and-a-halfyears increasing our investment in a number of key areas. We said in the secondhalf of last year that would start to slow down. You saw that most prominentlyin Q4 of last year, and that continued in the first three quarters of thisyear, as we have grown into this level of investment. I think certainly thatyou've seen that to date. 
I think one of the things you should keep in mind which is alittle different than where we were back in 2004 when we started this increasein investment, is our base is bigger. We can afford to invest with this higherbase that we have, more so than we did in 2004. So again, we will be sharingguidance for 2008 on our next call, but hopefully that helps.
Jeff Bezos
I'll just add to that by saying that the bigger base mightallow us to make investments over time, with less of a step function changethan you've seen in the past.
Anthony Noto  - Goldman Sachs
 I was also wonderingif you could comment, if you think about Amazon's value proposition for theconsumer today versus maybe three years ago, that value proposition has alwaysoffered increased selection, better prices and greater convenience. 
What do you think has changed at Amazon vis-à-vis the “on land”experience that has resulted in a meaningful widening of that gap?
Jeff Bezos
I think it is really just the continuation of those thingsthat you mentioned. Year in and year out, we have been adding categories andadding very significant selection and depth inside categories. It sometimessurprises people to learn that we continue to do that, even in the categorieswe have been involved in the longest, such as books. But we do continue todeepen our categories there.
We've gotten better at managing inventory, so we're moreoften in-stock, which allows us to deliver products to customers much faster.We've also just incrementally over time gotten more efficient, better at defectreduction so we can do things accurately for customers at low cost. That hasallowed us to continuously lower prices.
I think it's the combination of those things: gettingproducts to customers quickly, having the broad selection and the deepselection, and having very attractive price points in combination with freeshipping. That package of things, we have been very, very consistent on for along time. I don't think there any changes there. I just think that every year,we get a little bit better.
Operator
Your next question comes from David Joseph - Morgan Stanley.
 David Joseph - Morgan Stanley
 I have one questionrelated to gross margin. It looks like it came down by about 44 basis pointsyear over year, and we did notice that your shipping loss was up nearly about40%, but it looks like your third party sellers were actually accelerated.  I'm wondering if there was a one-time impactthere from Harry Potter. Maybe you can also talk a little bit about thecontribution from third party sales.
As an additional comment on that, our question would befulfillment and G&A. G&A actually declined on an absolute basis; fulfillmentdeclined on a percentage basis of revenue. Fulfillment might be scale, but canyou tell us a little bit about if  we'remissing anything on fulfillment, but also what might have lead to decline inG&A? Thank you.
Tom Szkutak
In terms of gross margins, yes, Harry Potter is having aneffect. It was slightly less than a contribution profit breakeven event for us.You should assume that's a lower gross margin than our average, so it isbringing it down. 
In terms of our overall expense, as you look at our directsegment operating expenses, there are certainly a number of different impacts butkeep in mind, as I was mentioning a few questions ago, in the first threequarters of last year our direct segment operating expenses in total whichincludes tech and content, fulfillment, G&A and marketing, were growing ata rate that was faster than revenue, and Q3 is no exception to that. So we'regetting leverage on each of those line items.
 David Joseph - Morgan Stanley
With the impact to gross margin on Harry Potter, should weexpect that to normalize over the next couple of quarters?
Tom Szkutak
Again, we're not giving guidance on those individual lineitems, but certainly what we expect is reflected in our Q4 guidance, but it didhave an impact on our Q3 results.
Operator
Your next question comes from Victor Anthony - Bear Stearns.
Victor Anthony  - Bear Stearns
I wonder if you could give us an update on yourinternational expansion plans beyond the six international locations that youhave right now? I am curious as to what geographies look attractive. And, anysort of timeframe?
The second question is really on the internationalelectronics and other general merchandise category. It looks like there was asignificant acceleration in revenues on that line, and I was curious as to whatis driving that particular acceleration.
The final question is really on your guidance for 4Q. Itlooks the pro forma operating margin at the midpoint is really calling for amodest improvement on a year-over-year basis, compared to the sizable jump inthis particular third quarter that you just reported. I'm wondering if there'sanything of note in that particular quarter in the guidance? Thanks.
Tom Szkutak
 As it relates to theinternational expansion, we certainly will add new geographies over time, butwe certainly think there's a lot of improvement in terms of additionalselection that we can add in the geographies that we're in. We really like thegeographies that we're in. 
In terms of categories today, we're most penetrated in the U.S.right now, and each of the individual geographies outside of the U.S.don't have the same depth that we do in our Amazon.com website. So that'sclearly a focus for us as we add new categories, selection within thoseexisting categories as well as new categories.
You mentioned the EGM growth in international beingaccelerated this quarter. What's driving that is some of the things that we'vebeen talking about which is really just fundamentals. We have been addingselection. We continue to try to improve the customer experience, making surethat our prices are sharp in all of the geographies and categories that we'rein and continue to work on reducing those overall customer-facing defects. Sothose are the things that are really helping our international EGM growth.
In terms of guidance, the implied guidance for CSOItranslates into a range of 5.4% on the low side to 6.3% on the high side foroperating margins, with the midpoint being at 5.9%, which is up from 5.7% lastyear. Two things to keep in mind. One is, as you look at last year's results,through the first three quarters the growth rate for those individual quarters,excluding foreign exchange, were anywhere from 23% to 25%. In Q4, it jumped to30% and we've had sizable growth since then. So again, we're overlapping that30% growth rate.
The second piece is, as I was mentioning about our directsegment operating expenses growing at a faster rate for the first threequarters of last year, it was growing at a faster rate than revenue. In Q4, ourdirect segment operating expenses were actually growing at a slower rate thanrevenue and we are overlapping that as well. So those two factors, must certainlybe taken into account as we look at our guidance for Q4.

Your next question comes from Mark Mahaney - Citi.
Mark Mahaney  - Citi
 I wanted to ask aboutthe progress or status of some of the digital media offerings. It looks likeUnbox is coming up through a couple of iterations, nice healthy improvement inthe product and in the user interface. You've had the music service out. Canyou quantify at all or give any qualitative comments about what kind oftraction you're seeing for those segments? 
Maybe just to stress out the negative, are you seeing anysigns that is cannibalizing existing sales of CDs or of DVDs? Thanks a lot.
Jeff Bezos
I would just say that we're very happy with the earlyresults that we're seeing. We're getting terrific feedback from customers.Everybody loves the DRM free format, so selling MP3s is very successful for us.We have a lot of initiatives that we continue to work on. One of the thingswith our MP3 store is the way we look at it, the onus is on us to continue toconvince music labels that this is a good way to sell their music. So wecontinue to work on that, but we're very happy with the way that it's going. 
Our approach on this is you get out there and you getstarted, and you try to figure out what customers want and try to figure outhow to give it to them, and then just repeat that consistently over a number ofyears. So you can count on us to keep working on those things. We're thrilledwith the early results from customers.
Mark Mahaney  - Citi
 No evidence that it'shad any impact on the physical CD or DVDs sales?
Jeff Bezos
 We haven't seen anyevidence of that. I think it's way too early to know whether you would see anyof that.
Operator
Your next question comes from Brian Pitz - Bank of America.
 Brian Pitz - Bank of America
 First, any commentaryon the performance or traction of some of your newer, higher-margin categoriessuch as handbags, shoes or even auto parts? Then maybe some thoughts on newareas for expansion?
A follow-on to the digital media question, you're offeringthis digital locker to store digital books and video downloads. Is it possiblefor you to add essentially similar features for music downloads as well, downthe road? Thanks.
Jeff Bezos
 Well, with respect toyour last question first, that's exactly the kind of thing that we try tosolicit feedback on from customers and see if it would be helpful and if it is,then work together with our industry partners to try and figure out how to makethat happen.
As far as some of the new categories go, we like the resultswe see. When we launch a new category, we always go through a period where wehave to have significant inventory upfront relative to the early sales, sothat's one of the factors that contributes in our corporate-wide inventoryturns. But those are very good investments and what we see is over time, we getvery good at managing these new categories.
What we're initially trying to do when we launch a newcategory is make sure that the customer experience is good, even from thebeginning. So we forward-invest in the customer experience in a new category tomake sure that it's going to be acceptable to customers. We try to get betterat it, and then we hone the economics in those new categories over time.
Operator
Your next question comes from Scott Devitt - StifelNicolaus.
Scott Devitt  - Stifel Nicolaus
The question relates to Merchants@ internationally. Ibelieve the marketplace has been open in the international market for a fewyears now, so I'm trying to get a better understanding of how significantMerchants@ can be internationally, over time. 
I was wondering if you could just talk about the mixdomestically between Amazon Marketplace for third party units and Merchants@,just to better understand the dynamics? Thank you.
Tom Szkutak
If you take a look at our international third party business,as I mentioned in the opening remarks, our total worldwide third party units asa percentage of total units is 32%. We haven't broken out the details betweenNorth America and international, but certainly the North America is morepenetrated than international is. But we see nice progress in international interms of improving as a percentage of third party units. So we are very pleasedwith how that part of the business is going, and that's certainly one of thedrivers that you see reflected in our gross margins on international.
In terms of how big it can be, it's a difficult question toanswer. What we do is two things. We're very focused on trying to improve ouroverall customer experience, which includes third parties. We're focused onimproving the retail side of our business, meaning product that we selldirectly, and so we are continuously trying to add selection, add newcategories, improve in-stocks, as Jeff mentioned, to drive the retail business.
Then we're also focused on how do we improve the sellerexperience, so it makes it easier for sellers to sell?
So ultimately where that will end up in terms of balancewill be up to the customer to decide on what that ultimate mix will be. But ourgoal is certainly to improve the experience, keep on improving the experiencefor both sellers and customers. We think with that, the customers can decidewhere that ends up.
Jeff Bezos
One category to highlight, perhaps -- especially as we gointo the holiday season here -- is the toy category. This is going to be, byfar, our best customer experience in the toy category in the company's history.And it is not only Amazon retail toys, but there is also now a very strongnetwork of third party toy sellers in the toy category. The combination ofthose is providing an outstanding customer experience. That will be part of ourrecord holiday, and we're really excited about it.
Scott Devitt  - Stifel Nicolaus
Thank you very much. Are you able to give any informationdomestically related to Amazon Marketplace versus Merchants@ which maybe couldgive better color as to the international dynamics?
Tom Szkutak
I apologize. We really can't help you with that.
Operator
Your next question comes from Justin Post - Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post  - Merrill Lynch
 I have a couple ofinterrelated questions to gross margin. I've got your third party units upnorth of 40%. It really looks like you are taking share there. Can you quantifyat all the impact on gross margins? Do you expect that to really help nextyear?
Then if you look at the U.S.,if you back out the Harry Potter revenues, everybody is going to have their ownassumptions, but it looks like gross margins were still down in the U.S.,ex-that. Is that just because of the new categories, or was that more pricing-related?Could you really get into what drove that, and is that part of your 4Qguidance?
Tom Szkutak
 In terms of the North America piece, certainly Harry Potter is having a negative impacton gross margins. Also, mix of business is impacting gross margins as well. Interms of the other part of your question, the first part, can you just repeatthat again?
Justin Post  - Merrill Lynch
We have your third party units outstripping your regularunit growth; we have it at over 40%. What kind of impact is that having ongross margins, and do you think that could be a positive driver as we look outto next year?
Tom Szkutak
Well in terms of impact, certainly our third party businessin general helps our gross margins, and certainly other factors to think aboutwhen you look at our gross margins are we continue to lower prices forcustomers, we continue to try to make sure we get great prices from suppliersand also mix of business. Those are the key factors that are impacting grossmargins. In terms of 2008 again, we will be giving our guidance for 2008 afterthe Q4 call.
Justin Post  - Merrill Lynch
Last question. As you look out to the holidays, any specificproducts that you're excited about or want to mention that we should be lookingfor on Amazon?
Jeff Bezos
There are probably a bunch, but the one that I wouldhighlight is Amazon Prime. I mean, especially during the holiday season, wehave been very successful signing up Amazon Prime members, but there are stilla lot of people out there that would benefit from being Amazon Prime members.The people who are members love it; that's certainly, for the holiday season, avery good product.

Your next question comes from Imran Khan – JP Morgan.
 Imran Khan - JP Morgan
I understand that your gross profit margin in internationalis 20.5%. Obviously, third party is significantly lower in the internationalmarket. I am trying to get a better sense of how quickly you can narrow the gapbetween U.S.and international gross profit margins?
Jeff, you talked about putting customers first to drive thegrowth and increase shareholder value. As your third party business becomes abigger and bigger part of your business and your third party sellers numbergrows, how do you ensure customer satisfaction? Thank you.
Jeff Bezos
I'll take that second one first. It's a very good question,and it's something we spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about andfocusing on. We've done a lot over time to maintain that customer experience.It starts with making sure that we have a good method of evaluating third-partysellers and making sure that they are sincere and want to do a great job forcustomers. We have a big team of people that do that.
The other thing is we have started something calledFulfillment by Amazon, which is getting a lot of early traction, growingrapidly. It allows third-party sellers to effectively let us do the fulfillmentfor them so they can, using Fulfillment by Amazon, send products directly toour fulfillment centers and then we do the packing and shipping directly tocustomers.
That has a lot of systemwide efficiencies in it for thethird party seller and for us, because for one thing, if a customer orders twoitems they may order an item from us and they might order an item from thethird party seller. If the third party seller is using Fulfillment by Amazon,then we can marry those two items together in a single box, which saves asignificant amount of money in transportation costs. We're able to pass some ofthat savings on to the third party sellers who use Fulfillment by Amazon.
At the same time, from a customer experience point of view,if we are the ones fulfilling that third party unit, the customers get all ofthe benefits that they are accustomed to when they buy an Amazon retail unit.So for example, they get gift wrap, they get Free Super Saver Shipping. If theyare Amazon Prime members, they get two-day shipping for free on that third partyunit. So it basically levels the playing field for third party sellers andallows them to give the consumer all of the same benefits that Amazon retail isproviding. That's an example of the kind of program that we tried to put inplace. We're seeing very good reception from our seller community in taking usup on that offer.
Tom Szkutak
 In terms of the firstpart of your question, it's difficult to predict the answer to your question asit relates to gross margins. I can tell you how we think about it, though. Someof the inputs are as we enter new categories we're trying to make sure that wehave a great customer experience. 
We start with adding selection. We continue to work on theinput to customer experience, making it convenient for customers, making surethat the pricing is right. Over time, what happens is you'll get scale in thatparticular category. When you do that, good things happen. You have more thirdparties that are attracted to those detail pages to sell their products on. Wealso get better savings from vendors as we buy more from vendors.
So as you think about those countries that we are in today,as we improve the scale of those by again, adding new selection, adding newcategories, those are the things that will help us with our core part of ourretail business as well as third parties and getting better savings fromvendors. 
So the combination are certainly the things that will helpus improve over time in international.
 Imran Khan - JP Morgan
Jeff, in terms of Amazon Prime, you have had that for awhile. Could you talk a little bit about the learnings you have had from AmazonPrime? How does that help you to improve your fulfillment and inventorymanagement efficiency? Do you think as we continue to have Amazon Prime andmore customer takes, you can actually have better selections and better stockavailability and can enhance your fulfillment? Thank you.
Jeff Bezos
 Well, one of theopportunities over time is, what Amazon Prime does as it continues to grow isit increases our express shipping volume. We have more volume now being shippedtwo-day rather than standard because for $79 a year, Amazon Prime members getunlimited free two-day shipping with no hurdle. So you can right now our FreeSuper Saver Shipping offer is available to everyone, but it's a slower class ofservice and it has a $25 minimum order threshold in order to qualify for SuperSaver Shipping. So Amazon Prime members have no threshold, and they get two-dayshipping for free. It's a very big change in the customer experience for anAmazon Prime member, and one that we know they love.
Our opportunity over time on the cost structure side is alarge one when we have sufficient scale to take advantage of it, because theopportunity is to modify the fulfillment center network so that it's optimizedfor faster delivery. You can imagine that a network optimized for two-daydelivery would look a bit different from a network optimized for standarddelivery. Those kinds of opportunities are available to us in the future as wecontinue to scale.

Your next question comes from Doug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers.
Doug Anmuth  - Lehman Brothers
I wanted to follow up on Prime. What have the early returnsof Prime been in Japan?Second, can you give us some color on the large amount of hiring that you didduring 3Q? I think you added 1,400 people to your headcount. Was that mostlybased in fulfillment centers, or was there another part of the business?
Jeff Bezos
The answer to the second part of your question is yes, themajority of that was fulfillment center related as we get ready for the holidayseason. Those are largely variable personnel as we grow our business in Q4.
In terms of the Prime question as it relates to Japan it'svery, very early. From what we see so far we're very pleased. Customers lovethe offering that we have. They are very excited about it, so it's still very,very early but we're getting very good feedback from customers.

Your next question comes from Jeffrey Lindsay - SanfordBernstein.
Jeffrey Lindsay  - Sanford Bernstein
We had a couple of things we wanted to ask about. Weunderstand from the press that there's some dispute about the patentexclusivity of 1-Click. Could you give us some guidance on how significant theloss of 1-Click patent exclusivity could be for Amazon? 
Second, could you also give us some guidance on what thepotential impact could be from loss of the Borders book business in 2008? Finally,could you just give us an indication of how well you're doing in freshgroceries? Thank you.
Jeff Bezos
 In terms of 1-Click,we have a longstanding practice of not talking about such matters outside ofour public filings. You should refer to our public filings.
In terms of the other parts of your question, the grocerypiece, we have a category, dry goods/grocery that we're very pleased with theperformance to-date. It's a great way for customers to buy a number ofdifferent dry goods, an assortment of dry goods items, generally in bulk. So weare very excited about what we see there so far. But again, it's still veryearly.

Your next question comes from Shawn Milne - Oppenheimer.
Shawn Milne  - Oppenheimer
Tom, I just have a couple of housekeeping questions. Interms of your revenue growth guidance in the fourth quarter, are you assumingany material follow-on impact from Harry Potter? 
I just wanted to follow up on the fulfillment question. Itdid dip below as a percent of sales a little bit from what we were looking for.Are you seeing any impact already from what Jeff was talking about in terms ofscale with the fulfillment network? Or is it just the Harry Potter impact onfulfillment costs in the third quarter? Thanks.
Jeff Bezos
In terms of the impact of Q4 as it relates to Harry PotterVII, there certainly will be sales that will happen related to Harry PotterVII, but it won't be as sizable as what you're seeing in Q3, or at least we'renot anticipating that. In quarters where we've had sales such as that, that hasbeen the biggest impact. In terms of fulfillment, what you're seeing is justleveraging our overall fulfillment center infrastructure. I don't have anyother comments beyond that.

On FPS, the Flexible Payment Service, I'm curious what kindof traction you are seeing for that service early on? What kinds of retailersare you seeing adopt the service? Thank you.
Jeff Bezos
For anybody else on the call who may not know this, FPSstands for Flexible Payment Service. It is one of our infrastructure web services,with the Elastic Compute Cloud, the Simple Storage Service, and the Simple QueueService. These services are all developer-facing services, so they are a set ofAPIs that software developers can use to build web scale applications.
Obviously if you're building web scale applications, in manycases you have to be able to charge people for things. The Flexible PaymentService is the first payment service specifically designed from the ground upfor developers, and it has a lot of features that make it very flexible andeasy to use for developers to incorporate payments into their own applications.
So that set of services that we're offering to developers isgrowing very, very rapidly and has gotten an unusual amount of traction. We arevery, very gratified to see this early uptake in the development community.It's happening at the very small scale with small software developers;one-person and two-person shops. It's also happening at the middle scale withventure capital-funded startups; and then at the large scale, with enterprisecustomers all the way from the small up to the big. So it's a very exciting andnew product offering. 
These infrastructure services are things that we needed tobuild for ourselves in order to run the web scale application called Amazon.While we were in the process of building these things, we decided to build themin an external way so we could charge for them and turn them into a new profitcenter. 
We're very excited about this.

Tom Szkutak
Thanks, Kim. I'll begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased 87% to $700 million, while the combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding decreased 2% to $435 million. 
Worldwide revenue grew 35% to $2.89 billion, or 33% excluding the $46 million favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. Media revenue increased to $1.83 billion, up 27% or 25% excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM revenue increased to $970 million, up 55% or 53% excluding FX. EGM continued to increase its share of our worldwide sales mix, representing 34% of sales in Q2 of 2007, up from 29% for the same period last year. 
Our worldwide unit growth was 25%, and active customer accounts exceeded 69 million, up 16% year over year. Worldwide gross profit was $701 million, up 38%. Gross margin increased 49 basis points to 24.3%, primarily due to the wind down and termination last year of our contract with TRU, which negatively impacted worldwide gross margins in Q2 2006 by approximately 90 basis points and North America gross margin by approximately 170 basis points. This was offset partially by product mix. 
Worldwide active seller accounts were over 1.1 million, and third-party units, representing Marketplace and Merchants@ units sold on Amazon sites, were 30% of total units versus 29% in the prior year. 
Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content and G&A combined was $536 million or 18.6% of sales, an improvement of 148 basis points year over year. Fulfillment was $248 million or 8.6% of net sales, up 8 basis points year over year. In the quarter, we announced plans for a new fulfillment center in Phoenix, and we opened up a fulfillment center in Guangzhou, China. 
Technology and content was $176 million or 6.1% of net sales, an improvement of 99 basis points year over year as we continue to grow into our new level of spending. In 2007, technology and content will increase in absolute dollars, but we expect the growth rate of our spending in T&C to be significantly less than it was in 2006. 
Now I'll talk about our segment results. Consistent with prior periods, we cannot allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line items. In the North America segment, revenue grew 38% to $1.6 billion. This is the highest growth rate in more than six years. Media revenue grew 26% to $923 million. EGM revenue grew 66% to $606 million, representing 38% of North America revenues, up from 32%. 
We saw another quarter of strong sales in electronics; and revenue from soft goods -- which includes jewelry, apparel, shoes and sporting goods -- doubled year over year. North America gross profit grew 40% to $434 million, and gross margin increased 34 basis points. North America segment operating income increased 233% to $82 million, a 5.1% operating margin. 
In the International segment, revenue was $1.28 billion, up 31% year over year or 26% adjusted for the $45 million favorable foreign exchange impact. Media revenue grew 27% to $910 million or 23% excluding FX. In EGM, revenue grew 40% to $364 million or 34% excluding FX. 
International gross profit grew 34% to $267 million or grew 29% excluding FX, while gross margin increased 48 basis points to 20.8%, which reflects increased third-party mix offset partially by lower prices, product mix and free shipping offers. 
International segment operating income increased 50% to $83 million, a 6.4% operating margin. Excluding the $3 million favorable impact from foreign exchange rates, International operating income increased 42%. Consolidated segment operating income grew 106% to $165 million or 5.7% of net sales, up 198 basis points year over year. 
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 149% to $116 million or 4% of net sales. 
Our provision for income taxes was $33 million in Q2 or a 30% rate for the quarter, which includes a $4 million year-to-date adjustment to reflect our current estimate of our annual effective tax rate of 26%, which incorporates our strong North America growth. As a reminder, there's potential for significant volatility of our effective tax rate, due to several factors including variability in accurately predicting the amount and mix of tax flow income by jurisdiction. 
In 2007, we anticipate cash paid for income taxes will be approximately $25 million, compared to $15 million in 2006, as we continue to benefit from NOLs in the United States. NOL utilization is impacted by many factors, including our excess stock-based compensation deductions. 
GAAP net income was $78 million or $0.19 per diluted share, compared with $22 million and $0.05 per diluted share. 
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities were $1.66 billion, an increase of $245 million year over year. Inventory increased 41% to $735 million, and inventory turns decreased from 14.3 a year ago to 12.9 as we expanded selection and improved in-stock levels across product categories and geographies and introduced new product categories. 
Our investment in fixed assets, which includes net capitalized software development costs, increased $38 million from a year ago to $443 million. Our return on invested capital was 39%. ROIC is free cash flow divided by average total assets minus average current liabilities. 
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. However, there is a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as marking our euro-denominated debt to market quarterly, intercompany balances in foreign currencies that settle amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material impact on guidance. Our guidance assumes that we don't record any additional intangible assets or any further revisions to stock-based compensation or our restructuring-related estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently. 
For Q3, we expect net sales of between $3 billion and $3.175 billion or growth of between 30% and 38%. This guidance anticipates greater than 200 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. 
GAAP operating income to be between $75 million and $110 million or grow between 88% and 175%. This includes approximately $50 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. 
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $125 million and $160 million, or grow between 73% and 122%. 
For the calendar year 2007, we expect net sales of between $13.8 billion and $14.3 billion or growth of between 29% and 34%. This guidance anticipates greater than 200 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. 
GAAP operating income to be between $540 million and $640 million or growth of between 39% and 65%. This includes approximately $185 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. 
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $725 million and $825 million or grow between 45% and 65%. 
We anticipate our 2007 free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to our operating profit growth rate year over year, with some variability from changes in working capital. We expect capital expenditures, including capitalized software development costs, to be approximately $250 million. We will continue to strive for year-over-year annual growth in free cash flow and free cash flow per share while investing in our long-term opportunities. We're confident that if we continue to improve customer experience and execute efficiently, our value proposition as well as our free cash flow will expand. 
With that, I'd like to open it up for questions. 
Kim Nelson
Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call with Jeff and Tom. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question? 
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Mary Meeker - Morgan Stanley. 
Dave Joseph - Morgan Stanley
Dave and Mary here, and we just have really one question. It seems like you saw a pretty strong improvement in gross margin. I know that there was a one-time impact there, but it also seems that there might be third-party sales at work there which continue to be strong, or so it seems. 
I guess our question is twofold. One is, why do you think you're seeing such strong traction in third-party sales right now? How important is this to the improvement of Amazon's gross margins going forward? In other words, how sustainable do you think this is? 
Tom Szkutak
Sure. As it relates to third parties, as we have been mentioning really over the past few years, we have been investing in improving what we call seller platforms, and that's surrounding everything that makes it easier for sellers to sell, which includes third parties as well as ourselves. So I think what you are seeing is certainly an improvement in third-party sales, third-party units were 30% for the quarter as a percentage of total units, which is up from 29%. Certainly, some of that is the launch of Merchants@ International, which we have mentioned on previous calls. Certainly, that's what you're seeing there. 
In terms of the importance of it overall, I'll talk about it in terms of our free cash flow rather than our gross margins. We think that this model of having us as a seller as well as third-party is very important for customers, and also works for us financially as well. So what the customer sees is they get additional selection that they might not ordinarily get from us by having third parties. They also get the benefit of seeing where there's overlap, seeing competing sellers on our detail pages which they can select from. 
So we think the combination of these factors is great for customers and great for shareholders and so we think it should be a meaningful part of our business as we move forward. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Anthony Noto - Goldman Sachs. 
 Anthony Noto - Goldman Sachs
You mentioned the third-party business being launched internationally but it looks like the bulk of your acceleration in revenue is from your North American business growing 38% year over year in the first quarter, while International decelerated. So I want to focus in on that. 
When we look at the domestic business's acceleration and we drill down, it looks like it accelerated in both media and EGM; EGM being the biggest factor, up 66% versus 51% in the first quarter. My question is very specifically, what drove the most incremental dollars in North American EGM to drive that 66% year-over-year growth, which category? 
Tom Szkutak
We're not providing details on the specific categories that make up EGM, but in terms of what's driving it is customers are responding to what they believe is an excellent value proposition which includes low prices, fast delivery and increased selection. As part of that, fast delivery, Prime is certainly a factor. Prime is a more meaningful part of our overall units during Q2 than it has been previously, so we have more subscribers, as well as they are buying more. So that is certainly a key driver. 
One other thing to keep in mind is in addition to those key factors, as you look at year over year specifically for North America, keep in mind that last year Q2 we had the impact of the wind down and determination of TRU, which infected our revenue by approximately $20 million, which we disclosed last year during Q2. So keep that in mind as you look at our overall growth results in EGM as well. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank Securities. 
 Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank Securities
Good quarter, guys. A couple of questions. As you look at your growth in newer categories, non-media-related, can you talk about, what is the growth a result of? Is it actually more the consumer experience and what Amazon has continued to present to the consumer? Or do you think it is more the seller economics from a third-party standpoint? 
Second, as you look at the penetration of third party, it looks like about 50% to 55% of U.S. units and maybe around 5% to 10% in the UK, given the strength domestically. Can you talk about how do you grow or expand the third-party business internationally? What are the critical success factors for you to get to a 50/55 split internationally as you see in the U.S.? 
Jeff Bezos
In terms of the overall numbers, we have not actually provided any numbers by segment. So the numbers that you are quoting, we haven't provided what the third-party units are by segment. Overall, it's 30% as a percentage of total. What we have said though is that our North America is higher than International, so there's clearly an opportunity there. 
But in terms of how we drive it, it's consistent with what we've said in the past. We are continuously focused on how to make the experience better for customers as well as sellers. So you're talking about some of the new categories as part of your question. What we're finding is, when you launch a new category you need traffic to those detail pages. As you get more meaningful traffic to those detail pages, it becomes more attractive for third-party sellers to participate. So that's the best way for us to help our third-party business; it is the same as it is to help our retail business, which is to make that customer experience great. When we do that, it attracts customers and traffic to our detail pages, which is good for sellers, which ultimately is good for customers, having these offers, as well as investors. So that's how they intertwine. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Mark Mahaney - Citigroup. 
 Mark Mahaney – Citigroup
Jeff, could you provide an update on some of the music and/or video offerings, how Amazon [caller dropped] 
Jeff Bezos
Speakerphone, perhaps? If you could pick up. 
Tom Szkutak
We just can't hear your question. 
Jeff Bezos
Yes, if you could repeat the question? 
 Mark Mahaney – Citigroup
Sorry, I apologize. An update on some of the digital media offerings, video and what kind of traction you are seeing in that? Thank you. 
Jeff Bezos
On some of the digital media offerings, could you discuss the traction that you are seeing? Is that the question? Sorry, you are breaking up a little bit. 
 Mark Mahaney – Citigroup
Yes. We are having a power outage. 
Jeff Bezos
It's too early for us to discuss any of the traction we're seeing . As you know, we have Amazon Unbox, which has downloadable videos, and have made arrangements with TiVo so that we can offer customers those videos directly to their TiVo Series 2 and Series 3 Internet-connected boxes. Then we have announced but not yet launched an MP3 DRM-free music offering that we're very excited about, but you'll have to wait and stay tuned for that. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Brian Pitz - Banc of America. 
 Brian Pitz - Banc of America
Can you provide some additional color on the impact of Harry Potter attachments in the quarter? Can you also give us any sense for advertising on the site, the potential impact there? Because we have been seen more and more advertisements throughout. Thanks. 
Jeff Bezos
In terms of the impact of Harry Potter 7, you're relating to Q2? Is that your question? 
 Brian Pitz - Banc of America
Yes. 
Jeff Bezos
In terms of Harry Potter 7, all of the shipments of the book are happening during Q3 but the associated attachments, our normal practice is to ship those products as they become available. So the impact on Q2 was less than 100 basis points globally. There's certainly also some traffic in addition to that, which is difficult to quantify what the incremental impact of that is. But in terms of the attachments themselves, it's less than 100 basis points. 
 Brian Pitz - Banc of America
Any color on advertising, any impact there? Or not really material yet? 
Jeff Bezos
Could you be more specific with your question? 
 Brian Pitz - Banc of America
Is advertising becoming a more material line item, would you say, going forward? Because we have been seeing a lot more advertisements throughout the site. 
Jeff Bezos
We haven't broken it out. Certainly, we're testing a number of things and seeing how they work. But that's the way we are thinking about it. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Robert Peck - Bear Stearns. 
 Robert Peck - Bear Stearns
Tom, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about free cash flow here. One of the great things about Amazon historically is you have managed your share count very well. It looks like this quarter you issued about 5.8 million shares, compared to last year for the full year you did around 9 million to 10 million, of which you bought back about 6 million or so. 
How do we think about the use of the free cash flow in 2007 and 2008, as we think about the increase of your shares, having almost doubled over the last three or four months? To buyback those 10 million shares would cost you north of $750 million. So how should we think about the allocation of the free cash flow going forward? 
Tom Szkutak
In terms of just one correction, maybe I might have misheard what you said. In terms of the share repurchase, you mentioned 6 million or 7 million. We actually purchased 14.5 million shares, which is $500 million over the past year. Maybe I just misheard the way you said it. 
 Robert Peck - Bear Stearns
I meant calendar year. 
Tom Szkutak
Calendar year, okay. In terms of looking forward, what we have said, certainly, is we have Board authorization to purchase up to $500 million worth of shares over the next two years. We also have an authorization to retire up to $500 million of debt. But what you should expect to see is, similar to what we have done in the past, we're going to think about it very thoughtfully in making sure that we do what is right for shareholders. 
We have been very mindful; certainly, we have retired debt that we think is appropriate. We talked about the 14.5 million shares that we repurchased over the past three or four years. We've also retired some convertible debt that avoided potential dilution of just under 10 million shares. 
So those are some of the examples of things that we've done in the past. But going forward, certainly, we will certainly be very mindful and do the right thing from a treasury and corporate finance perspective as we think about those decisions. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Doug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers. 
 Doug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers
Typically, in the past, when EGM has spiked as a percentage of your sales, it's negatively impacted gross margins a little bit. But here, EGM came in at 34% and you still posted some good gross margin upside. So can you talk more specifically about the drivers within gross margins and also whether the mix within EGM during the quarter was any different than it has been in the past? Thank you. 
Tom Szkutak
Sure. In terms of the gross margins, keep in mind gross margins for the quarter were up 50 basis points year over year. Keep in mind what I mentioned earlier relating to the wind down and termination of TRU, the impact that had on both revenue as well as gross profit and operating profit being a similar amount in terms of that termination. 
Now, that being said, those categories, meaning toys, baby and videogames, you should assume that as we launch those, those are like other categories that we launch, that when we launch new categories we are pricing our products very competitively and that they are lower gross margins to start with. So it's not a full impact of that 20 that you are seeing year over year. So those are some of the dynamics related to that. 
But in terms of other, we continue to have great low prices for customers. Offsetting that, we continue to be diligent on the COGS side, trying to get additional COGS out. Also what you're seeing, to make up the balance is specifically around third party, third party being 30% of total units, up from 29%. That's certainly overlapping where some of the toys was certainly third-party business last year, Q3. So that's taking into account that. So that would have been higher if that wasn't in there, if that makes sense. So those are some of the key drivers. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Justin Post - Merrill Lynch. 
 Justin Post - Merrill Lynch 
A couple things on the operating expense line. It looks like tech expense reaccelerated a bit. It was up $15 million sequentially. Any new initiatives on the tech side that you're excited about? 
Then on the marketing side, it looks like it was up 22% year over year, below revenue growth. Are you seeing some deflation in marketing costs, or could that have been just some Harry Potter traffic benefits that you got in the quarter? 
Tom Szkutak
I'll take the marketing one first. Marketing was 2.2% of revenue. If you look back, really, over the past two to three years, the range has been fairly tight; it has been anywhere from 2.2% to 2.7%. Certainly, this past quarter was at the lower end of that range. But there's nothing really unusual about that. I wouldn't expect it to, over time, to stay at the lower end of that range as you're thinking about it. 
In terms of technology and content, as we have said, we're going to continue to grow technology and content dollars. They were up about 16% year over year. Certainly, you're seeing some very positive leverage in the quarter due to that, because last year, Q2 was up 63%. 
So that's the delta that you are seeing, but we continue to invest in digital and web services, improving seller platforms, this category expansion that's included in those numbers as well, and other customer experience things that we are working on. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Aaron Kessler - Piper Jaffray. 
 Aaron Kessler - Piper Jaffray
First, on the web services, you're getting increasing traction there; maybe where you're seeing the best traction, and what do you see as the biggest opportunity, starting with Amazon web services? 
On the gross margin, domestic right now is about 6% ahead of international. Any reason we should think that international can't get similar to domestic longer term, assuming that you can get to a similar level of third-party sales? Thank you. 
Jeff Bezos
I'll take the web services one, and Tom can take the gross margins one. We are seeing very good early traction in our web services initiatives. It's one of the areas that we have been investing in over the last couple of years. It's very encouraging to see that traction. We've got a lot of great customers, and the team that's doing that is creating a lot of value for those customers. They are making it much easier for those customers to do business. 
This customer set is developers. A lot of them are start-up companies. If you are a start-up company building a web scale application, there's a lot of work that has to go into that. A lot of that work is not differentiating. So it's things like picking the right operating systems, getting your data centers set up and entering into contracts, et cetera, et cetera. There are a lot of decisions to be made and it's kind of a price of admission. It has to be done well, but it doesn't actually move the ball forward in terms of creating your differentiated product or service. 
So what Amazon Web Services does is make it easy for people, for developers, start-up companies and bigger companies; we're seeing a wide range of adoption from individuals, start-up companies of a single person to venture capital-funded start-up companies, all the way to very large corporations using these services. 
So we're very optimistic about the long-term potential. It's still very early, but we're working very hard on this, and we think it's, in the long-term, a very important business. We are very, very glad and we feel very lucky to have this new set of customers to work with, these developers. 
Tom Szkutak
In terms of the other part of your question related to gross margins, keep in mind that each of the countries that we operate in have their own local competitors. In any given quarter or time period you could have competitive dynamics which would make our gross margins on any particular category either higher or lower. But that being said, if you step back for a moment, from a structural standpoint, we don't think that there's a lot of differences of why or reasons why that they couldn't be similar over time. 
So the biggest thing that we need to do is we have a lot more selection today, as we have more categories in our U.S. web site. We have been expanding our international categories, as you have noticed over the past several years. But inclusive of the last couple quarters, you should expect to see an additional selection being added and new categories over the next 12 months in international. 
We talked about the third-party piece being more meaningful in North America versus international and some of the dynamics around that. So again, as we improve the customer experience, we think that that will be helpful to our international web sites, to bring those closer. As we get more meaningful in terms of size, in terms of negotiating better deals with suppliers, in terms of just higher rebates, just because of the sheer volume that we purchase, we think will get better. 
So all those things are helpful as we continue to grow, and we will have the ability to make those closer and closer over time. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Scott Devitt - Stifel Nicolaus. 
 Scott Devitt - Stifel Nicolaus
Thank you. The question relates to the U.S. business. There doesn't seem to have been a significant change in new users or new customers to the site, but the revenue growth rate acceleration is certainly meaningful. So I'm trying to see if you can give some detail, in terms of frequency changes in terms of purchasing patterns of the customer set, within Prime versus your other customers. 
I ask because the Media category, which is one of the more mature categories of the business, has accelerated now by 1,100 basis points if you go back to September of 2006. It seems as if that category benefits most from frequency increases of the Prime customer. Thanks. 
Tom Szkutak
We haven't disclosed any of the frequency patterns between Prime and non-Prime customers. But certainly, to get back to the drivers of what's helping our North America growth, the value proposition, low prices and fast delivery which includes, certainly, Prime is a big deal for us. It's certainly having an impact on our overall growth rate and becoming more meaningful as part of our overall units. It's impacting both media categories as well as EGM. 
In terms of frequency, we like what we see across the board, but particularly we like what we are seeing in Prime as it relates to frequency, because that's really what the program is designed to do, and that's what we are seeing. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Imran Khan – JP Morgan. 
 Imran Khan – JP Morgan
Obviously, your U.S. growth rate is pretty strong. I was wondering, how should we think about the international business? What are you doing to reaccelerate that business from this level? Not that the growth rate is bad, but reaccelerate to get to the U.S. level. 
Secondly I think, Tom, you touched a little bit about improving gross profit margin in the International market. There's a 700 basis points difference between U.S. versus International. Could you comment on that, how quickly we can see that gap narrow? 
Tom Szkutak
In terms of what are we doing with international, it was some of the things that I mentioned earlier, where we have been launching new categories, increasing selection and focused on improving the overall customer experience. Some of the things that we have done for Amazon.com, our U.S. website, we're also doing in international. 
One example of that is we launched Prime in Japan recently, so that's certainly something that we've found certainly meaningful for our U.S. website and are hopeful for Japan as well. So that's just another example. But there are many things that we're working on to try to improve the overall customer experience, which includes increased selection. 
Another one is certainly when we launched Merchants@ International. We showed the revenue growth. We had, actually, very solid unit growth in International, and one of the reasons why was because of launching Merchants@ International. So giving customers more additional selection that they didn't have before, on top of our growing retail selection has been helpful. So those are the things that we're working on to try to maximize our growth in International.

Your next question comes from Shawn Milne - Oppenheimer. 
 Shawn Milne - Oppenheimer 
Thank you and a good quarter. A lot has been talked about or asked about your third-party business. If we actually strip out the Toys 'R' Us units or what we estimate as the Toys 'R' Us units last year, we were estimating -- this is the third quarter in a row -- of 50% third-party unit growth. 
You talked about some of the structural changes you made to Seller Central. Do you think there has also been an uptick here on how you structured the actual buying experience or enabling sellers to get access to the Buy Box on Amazon on how that has impacted the third-party business? We've heard pretty big upticks in unit volume from sellers that have been able to get inside that box. If you can talk about that. 
Secondly, your incremental margin in the quarter was 11%. That's the highest I've seen in six or seven years. Tom, can you discuss a little bit, are we very quickly going to reach double-digit operating margins or are there other big investments? If you can talk about some of the other areas you are going to invest in in the next 12 to 18 months? Thanks. 
Tom Szkutak 
Well, in terms of seller experience, there's a number of things that we're working on with seller experience. I'm not sure really, what you're referring to as it relates to the Buy Box in terms of changes. But there's a number of things we're working on to improve the seller experience. You mentioned some of them in Seller Central. 
Another one which improves the customer experience and we think the seller experience is Fulfilled by Amazon or FBA. That's something that's very, very early for us. But again, it allows customers to buy from third-party merchants with us as the fulfiller. So that's something that we think is worth noting, even though it's still very early. So it's a way to improve the seller experience so the seller can focus on all of the other aspect associated with running their business, but not have to worry about the fulfillment side. So we think that that's clearly important. Again, a number of other seller experience initiatives as well. 
In terms of the operating margins as we've said in the past, nothing has changed. Our focus is to grow, to provide a great customer experience which we think will translate into maximizing free cash flow per share, and we are very focused on that over time. In terms of the level of operating margins, we've said that we think that double-digit operating margins are possible. That's not a projection, but they are possible. 
But what we're going to do is focus on maximizing free cash flow per share. If it works out to be that that's double-digit operating margins or some high single digits, that's fine. But again, the way to do that is to drive operating profit dollars, continue to work on leveraging our operating cycle as well as our fixed investment. We think those are the things that will help us get there. 
Jeff Bezos
I would just add on Fulfillment by Amazon, that the early sellers who are using that program, we're getting very positive feedback from them. It does accelerate their sales, because the consumers on Amazon, the buying customers, as soon as a seller starts using Fulfillment by Amazon, the buyers get to enjoy Free Super Saver Shipping; they get to enjoy the privileges of Amazon Prime membership on those items. So when a seller switches to Fulfillment by Amazon, a lot of the things that customers associate with items sold directly by Amazon all of a sudden apply from a customer experience point of view to those seller-sold items as well. That's a big deal for Amazon Prime members to be able to buy those items. 
So, as sellers join Fulfillment by Amazon, they can see an acceleration in sales, because of the improved customer experience of having Amazon do the fulfillment: offer free shipping, offer Fulfillment by Amazon, gift wrapping, next-day air shipment, et cetera, et cetera, all the things that we have worked hard over the last dozen years to get good at, those things automatically become something that's easy for sellers to offer their customers as well.

Your next question comes from Jeffrey Lindsay - Sanford Bernstein. 
 Jeffrey Lindsay - Sanford Bernstein 
International growth was good, but not as good as the U.S. I'd like to ask, why was this? Is it a product mix issue? Could we assume that international will eventually catch up with the U.S.? 
Tom Szkutak 
It's some of the things that I mentioned earlier in the call. Clearly, we're seeing what I would consider very solid growth in international today, and North America certainly has accelerated. Again, it's really driven by the value proposition, the pricing as well as fast delivery and fast delivery Prime being the big piece of that. 
Certainly, one way to help do that, which is what we're doing is in this case, launching Prime in Japan as one example of a way to make that happen. Also, we have a bigger selection in our North America business or our U.S. website, and we're expanding selection rapidly in our international websites as well. So that's another way of trying to get an experience that's better and better for customers. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Heath Terry - Credit Suisse. 
 Heath Terry - Credit Suisse 
Thank you. In the past, you've talked about using the margin leverage or the incremental leverage that you had in the business as fuel to lower prices and drive more free cash flow growth through the model. Should we assume that the margin growth that we're seeing here suggests that you guys feel like you have hit the sweet spot as far as lower prices are concerned, and that lower prices from here won't necessarily drive higher free cash flow and that we really should start to expect more margin exchange? 
Tom Szkutak 
No, you shouldn't assume that. You should assume that we're going to continue to make sure it's a very dynamic environment. There are many, many competitors out there in each of the categories that we sell in, on all of our websites around the world. Again, so we're going to continue to make sure that we have great prices for customers, and that's critical to the customer experience that we provide. It's one of the pillars that we have talked frequently about, so ultimately we're trying to make sure that we offer that great value proposition, which includes pricing, and it's the foundation of what we do. Nothing has changed there. 
Kim Nelson
Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

Thomas J. Szkutak
Thanks, Kim. I will begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12 month free cash flow increased 4% to $521 million, while the combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding decreased 2% to $430 million. 
Worldwide revenue grew 32% to $3.02 billion, or 29% excluding the $84 million favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. 
Media revenue increased to $1.99 billion, up 26% or 23% excluding FX. This is the highest growth rate for worldwide media in three years. 
EGM revenue increased to $947 million, up 48% or 44% excluding FX. EGM continued to increase its share of our worldwide sales mix, representing 31% of sales in Q107, up from 28% for the same period last year. 
Our worldwide unit growth was 23% and active customer accounts exceeded 66 million, up 15% year over year. 
Worldwide gross profit was $719 million, up 31%. Gross margin decreased 17 basis points to 23.8%. 
Worldwide active seller accounts were over 1.1 million and third party units representing marketplace and merchants at units sold on Amazon sites with 30% of total units versus 29% in the prior year. 
Now I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content and G&A combined with $540 million, or 17.9% of sales, an improvement of 86 basis points year over year. 
Fulfillment was $253 million, or 8.4% of net sales, up 6 basis points year over year. We continued to increase capacity through efficiencies, as well as adding leased warehouse space to our network. In the quarter, we announced plans for additional warehouses, one in the U.K. and one in France, supporting our international operations. 
Technology and content was $167 million, or 5.5% of net sales, an improvement of 55 basis points year over year as we continue to grow into our new level of spending. In 2007, technology and content will increase in absolute dollars but we expect the growth rate of our spending in T&C to be significantly less than it was in 2006. 
Now I will talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. 
In the North America segment, revenue grew 30% to $1.62 billion. Media revenue grew 21% to $990 million. EGM revenue grew 51% to $564 million, representing 35% of North America revenues, up from 30%. We saw another quarter of strong sales in electronics and revenue from soft goods, which includes jewellery, apparel, shoes and sporting goods, more than doubled year over year. 
Additionally, we are pleased with the early customer response to our grocery subscription service, which offers automated replenishment plus a 15% additional discount. Some of the most popular items for subscription include diapers, nutrition bars and coffee. 
North America gross profit grew 29% to $439 million and gross margin decreased 27 basis points to 27.1% from product mix and lowering prices. North America segment operating income increased 39% to $86 million, a 5.3% operating margin, up 34 basis points year over year. 
In the international segment, revenue grew 35% to $1.39 billion. Revenue growth was 27% adjusting for the $84 million year over year favorable FX impact during the quarter. Media revenue grew 31% to $1 billion, or 24% excluding FX, and EGM revenue grew 44% to $383 million, or 34% excluding FX. 
International gross profit grew 36% to $280 million, or grew 27% excluding FX, while gross margin increased 9 basis points to 20.1%, which reflects increasing third-party mix, offset partially by lowering prices, product mix, and free shipping offers. 
International segment operating income increased 61% to $93 million, or 6.7% operating margin, up 109 basis points year over year. Excluding the $7 million favorable impact from FX, international operating income increased 47%. 
CSOI grew 50% to $179 million, or 6% of net sales, up 69 basis points year over year. 
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 38% to $145 million, or 4.8% of net sales. 
Our income tax expense was $33 million in Q1, reflecting an effective tax rate of 23%. 
We expect our effective tax rate in 2007 to be approximately 23%. However, there is potential for significant volatility of our effective tax rate due to several factors, including variability in accurately predicting the amount and mix of taxable income by jurisdiction. 
In 2007, we anticipate cash paid for income taxes will be approximately $25 million compared to $15 million in 2006, as we continue to benefit from NOLs in the U.S. 
GAAP net income was $111 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, compared with $51 million and $0.12 per diluted share. 
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities were $1.42 billion, an increase of $86 million year over year. During the quarter, we repurchased 6 million shares of our common stock for $248 million, and today we announced authorization from our Board of Directors to repurchase up to $500 million of our common stock over the next 24 months. 
Inventory increased 40% to $754 million, and inventory turns decreased from 14.4 a year ago to 12.9, as we expanded selection and improved in-stock levels across product categories and geographies and introduced new product categories. 
Our investment in net fixed assets, which includes net capitalized software development costs, increased $81 million from a year ago to $442 million. 
Our return on invested capital was 30%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus the average current liabilities. 
I will conclude my portion of today’s call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. However, there is a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It is not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as marketing our Euro-denominated debt to market quarterly, inter-company balances in foreign currencies that settle amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on our guidance. 
Our guidance assumes that we do not record any additional intangible assets or any further revisions to stock-based compensation or our restructuring related estimates, and that FX rates remain approximately where they have been recently. 
For Q2, we expect net sales of between $2.7 billion and $2.85 billion, or growth of between 26% and 33%. This guidance anticipates greater than 200 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. 
GAAP operating income to be between $65 million and $105 million, or grow between 39% and 125%. This includes approximately $45 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. 
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $110 million and $150 million, or grow between 38% and 88%. 
For calendar year 2007, we expect net sales of between $13.4 billion and $14 billion, or growth of between 25% and 31%. This guidance anticipates approximately 200 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. 
GAAP operating income to be between $463 million and $593 million, or growth of between 19% and 52%. This includes approximately $170 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. 
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $630 million and $760 million, or growth between 26% and 52%. 
We anticipate our 2007 free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to our operating profit growth rate year over year, with some variability from changes to working capital, and we expect capital expenditures, including capitalized software development costs, to be approximately $250 million. 
We will continue to strive for year-over-year annual growth of free cash flow and free cash flow per share while investing in our long-term opportunities. We are confident that if we continue to improve customer experience and execute efficiently, our value proposition, as well as our free cash flow, will expand. 
Thanks, and with that, Kim, let’s move to questions. 
Kim Nelson
Thanks, Tom. Let’s move on to the Q&A portion of the call with Jeff and Tom. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question? 
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) 
Our first question today will come from Robert Peck from Bear Stearns. 
Robert Peck - Bear Stearns
Tom, I just wanted to clarify a couple of things. One is, could you give us a little bit of color around the spending of S3, EC2, where you see that spending going over the next couple of quarters, and what capacity are you using to handle the demand there? How does that capacity get adjusted for the 4Q? 
The second question is more on gross margins, where you see gross margins trending over the next couple of quarters, how do you see the impact of any further increased shipping supplements or even the negative shipping stuff you have been testing for Amazon.com? Thanks. 
Thomas J. Szkutak
Could you repeat the gross margin question again? I did not hear the last part of it. 
Robert Peck - Bear Stearns
The gross margin question is just more of how should we think about gross margins going forward to reflect any further increased shipping rebates, shipping supplements, and even implications of things like -- what is your turnover there? 
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of gross margins, certainly the endless rebate that you mentioned was also -- that’s the negative $5 shipping, if you will, is included in the results that you saw in Q1, so that is reflected in Q1 and it is reflected, whatever we might do going forward in each of our categories. Certainly reflected in the guidance that we have given, but what you are seeing in Q1 is certainly a contraction in our gross margins, meaning it was down 17 basis points year over year versus what we saw more recently, where it was down 110 basis points for the year, total year 2006 versus total year 2005, as well as a similar number for Q4. 
What you are seeing really is strength in our third party business, which you saw reflected, particularly in our international gross margins, as well as improvements in COGS. As we move forward, we are certainly still working very hard to get further COGS improvements, and the growth that we have seen in a lot of the categories and the scale that we are getting is helping us do that. 
Jeffrey P. Bezos
I will take the EC2 and S3 question, and just say we are -- we do not break it out. We are seeing very strong demand for those services and expect to continue to roll out new capacity for them. 
Robert Peck - Bear Stearns
Meaning that in the fourth quarter, would you therefore build up more capacity to handle what could be increased demand with that segment? 
Jeffrey P. Bezos
We have been adding new capacity for those services and I continue to expect that to continue indefinitely. 
Operator
Our next question is from Anthony Noto from Goldman Sachs. 
Anthony Noto - Goldman Sachs
Tom, you alluded to the margins internationally, gross margins benefiting from the increased mix of third party. Those margins on an historic basis relative to the U.S. have been quite a bit below. Do you think as that mix continues to improve, you could get your gross margins internationally to where they are domestically, and if not, why? 
And then the second question, can you quantify how much you think you benefit from the pre-orders of Harry Potter during this quarter, in terms of incremental traffic or attachment rates from pre-orders? Thank you. 
Thomas J. Szkutak
Sure. In terms of international, that is certainly one way which our international and North America gross margins will become closer over time, and so certainly it is an opportunity. Even though we saw nice growth in international third party, it is still -- it is a percentage of total units, not as high a percentage as North America, so it is certainly an opportunity for us going forward, and other areas as well. As you would imagine, in our international segment is a make-up of several different countries, and from a buying perspective as we get to scale in each of those categories and each of those countries, it will help us buy better which will also help us improve margins over time. So those are really the key drivers. 
In terms of pre-orders, the effect on Q1 has been small. We are very pleased with the pre-orders that we have today for Harry Potter 7, but in terms of the impact on our overall growth rate in Q1, we think it is a pretty small number. 
Anthony Noto - Goldman Sachs
Thank you. 
Operator
We will take a question from Mark Mahaney from City Investment Research. 
Mark Mahaney - City Investment Research
Great, thanks. I want to just follow-up on the third-party sales growth internationally. Could you give us any more clarity on that? Were there particular categories or stores in which you saw that third-party growth, or particular countries? 
And then, just a real quick question on the tax rate. It seems like it jumps around a lot. Is it reasonable to assume that 23% this year is what it will be like next year, and why the big change or the big bring down in the tax rate guidance? Thank you very much. 
Thomas J. Szkutak
Sure. I will take the tax rate question first. There is a lot of variability in the tax rate. The 23% is our best estimate for 2007. It is also our actual effective tax rate for Q1. We are not giving guidance on our effective tax rate going forward beyond 2007 again because of the variability surrounding it. 
I would like to point out though as well that our cash taxes paid last year were $15 million. We are estimating this year to be approximately $25 million, and so that is related to taxes. 
In terms of your other question was related to third-party, I think the only other color maybe, you were looking for some additional color, is just to keep in mind that we launched merchants at international in the U.K. and Germany in the second-half of last year. We have more recently launched it in Japan, and so that is certainly a driver, one of the drivers. 
But one of the other things that we have talked about frequently related to our international business and launching new categories in general, the more traffic we get to those individual categories, good things happen, and what I mean by good things happen, we are able to have, since we have more traffic we are able to get more third-party selling on our detail pages as well as get better COGS improvements over time. That is some of what you are seeing reflected in our Q1 results. 
Operator
We have a question from Scott Devitt from Stifel Nicolaus. 
Scott Devitt - Stifel Nicolaus
Thank you. First, on the breakdown of revenue, Amazon is the only large Internet company where the domestic sales are growing faster than international sales, so I am wondering if you could just talk to, in the markets that you are in internationally, the capacity for growth rates to actually improve with time. I think you noted the launch of marketplaces in the U.K. and Germany. Are there other drivers that in the intermediate term actually could cause the international growth rate to, on an organic basis, be above the domestic rate? And then I had a follow-up. 
Thomas J. Szkutak
Sure. We are actually very encouraged by the opportunity that we have globally, but certainly we are seeing at this stage a higher growth rate in North America than in international. EGM is certainly a big opportunity for us, both in North America and in international, and as we have talked about on previous calls, we just have a lot more categories today in North America. Over the next 12 months, you will be seeing more categories coming out, specifically in international, and we are going to continue to add not only new categories but add selection within the categories we are in. 
So we still think of it as a big opportunity, but you are right; our North America is outpacing international. Certainly as part of that, North America is certainly being helped by Amazon Prime. We are seeing what we -- certainly customers are liking what they see there and that is certainly being reflected in our overall growth rate in North America. 
Scott Devitt - Stifel Nicolaus
Thanks, and the follow-up is related to Amazon Unboxing Tivo, which seems to be an interesting new product. I was interested in the capacity to increase the content, what you think the constraints are in terms of the content owners actually providing the content so that you had a significant increase in selection in that category and the possibility longer term to possibly have a subscription model around that? Thanks. 
Thomas J. Szkutak
Well, we have been and continue to be in the process of adding selection. We just recently added the NHL, the National Hockey League, and you can expect us to continue to go down that path. It is certainly something that is a core brand attribute for Amazon.com, is Earth’s biggest selection, and there are lots of ways to continue to improve that selection and you can count on us to do it. 
I cannot remember what your -- was there a second part? 
Scott Devitt - Stifel Nicolaus
Subscription model in the movie category; as content increases, the capacity to actually create a subscription model without the same delivery constraints that a competitor may have. 
Thomas J. Szkutak
With regard to that, I will not be able to answer just because it is kind of forward-looking. We will have to wait and see how that develops. 
Scott Devitt - Stifel Nicolaus
Great. Thank you. 
Operator
We will go next to Jeetil Patel from Deutsche Bank Securities. 
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank
Great. Thank you. Good quarter. A couple of questions; first on the web services side, it is certainly a big opportunity. Can you discuss a bit of when does it become a more material component of your business strategy and how you approach customers on the start-up and programming side, and I guess when it becomes a meaningful contributor to the financials? 
Second, just on the digital music side, I would love to get your thoughts as you are in the music category, to how the MP3 standard competes against the iPod iTunes model, and is there an opportunity there as you look forward here, especially with DRM getting out of the industry altogether? Thanks. 
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of the web services, it is very early. We are very pleased with the traction that we are getting to date. It is certainly exciting to see, but it is very, very early. 
Jeffrey P. Bezos
These are the kinds of things -- I think we are really on to something, given the early initial traction. This is new customer stuff for us. We have been working on it for just a couple of years now, and there are already a very large number of developers using these services. We have gotten very positive feedback from them. We keep enhancing the services. The team here at Amazon that is working on these web services is super passionate about this, very, very excited. 
It is going to take -- in terms of your question of when it might affect the overall economics of the company, it is going to be -- inside a company of this, of our current scale, it takes a long time for businesses, new businesses to grow to where they have a meaningful impact on the overall. We have seen that previously with things like international, new product categories, and so on, so it is going to require some patience in order to see that have a financial return but it is certainly just excellent early traction. 
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank
Jeff, do you think that has the potential to be just as significant as the core retailing business that you are sitting in today? 
Jeffrey P. Bezos
The market sizes are potentially very large, and how large it can be, over what kind of time frame, we will have to wait and see. I think it is premature to speculate about that but we are going to keep inventing in that area and working hard to satisfy developer customers. 
Operator
Our next question is from Brian Pitz from Banc of America. 
Brian Pitz - Banc of America
Thank you. Would you give us a sense as to how much of an impact the mix shift to media from electronics this quarter was helpful to margins? 
And then a second unrelated, how much of the strong international results were related to the U.K., given that growth over there, both on the advertising and e-commerce side, has been so strong? Thanks. 
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of your question around mix, we actually saw very strong growth across both media and EGM over the 12-month period, so I would not necessarily consider it a significant shift in terms of mix. There was certainly a little bit of mix shift within the international piece where we had media growing, it was accelerated and EGM was not, but in total aggregate, we did not really see a big mix shift. 
In terms of any specific country, you were asking about the U.K., we are not splitting our results out that way. We reported on the two segments, international and North America, but we certainly saw solid growth in international, with growth of 27% ex exchange. That is right in the range that we have seen over the last several quarters. It has been in the 26% to 29% range, and we saw very strong growth in North America, with Q4 and Q1 being really very strong growth versus what we have seen over the past several years in terms of growth rate being 30% and 31% in the last two quarters. 
So again, seeing very strong growth. 
Brian Pitz - Banc of America
Just a quick follow-up, on Tivo, any new metric you could share with us in terms of the 1.5 million subs that are either buying or renting movies, or any metrics on that front? Thanks. 
Thomas J. Szkutak
No, we do not have any new metrics to share there. 
Operator
We will go next to Justin Post from Merrill Lynch. 
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch
If you take the midpoint of your range of GAAP operating income from last quarter to this quarter, I think it went from 3.2 to 3.8, if our calculations are correct, and it seems like it is on the gross profit side but could you talk about why your margin expectations have increased? Are you seeing less price competition in the media categories? Are there any other things that you want to mention that have improved your optimism on your operating margins? 
Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of the operating margins, we have improved both our top line, our CSOI, and our implied operating margins for the year. The reason for that is over really the last 90 days, we have seen certainly stronger growth, which customers are telling us that they like the selection and the pricing and the convenience that we have, and so certainly we are seeing the impact of that higher growth, particularly in North America. 
We also saw better, as I mentioned earlier, better COGS. Again with our revenue being higher, we are just getting better COGS improvements, and as well as our third-party mix. 
So those are the key things at the gross margin level, and then we were able to, in Q1 we were able to leverage our operating costs with this higher growth rate. If you assume that certainly a portion of our total operating costs is relatively fixed, and so as we increase our revenue like we did, we will be able to leverage that fixed cost infrastructure, which is also helping our operating margins as well. 
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch
Great, thank you. One quick follow-up; do you have a number in front of you, what your NOL is right now at this point? 
Thomas J. Szkutak
It was $1.7 billion at the end of 2006 is what we reported in the K. We have certainly utilized some of that up during Q1, but beyond that I cannot help you with that number.

We will take a question from Douglas Anmuth from Lehman Brothers. 
Douglas Anmuth - Lehman Brothers
Thank you. My question also follows up on your margins, but it is more on the going forward basis. Looking at your outlook, just given the fact that you posted 6% pro forma operating margins in 1Q, and I am trying to figure out what you are thinking over the next nine months of the year, given that the guidance for the full year is 4.7% to 5.4% operating margin, so what specifically could drag down those margins over the next nine months versus where you are now, or -- I am trying to figure out why those numbers are not conservative going forward. Thank you. 
Thomas J. Szkutak
Sure. In terms of the range, as you would expect, we do have some volatility in our sales rates as you look out in each of our individual quarters. In other words, just based on the guidance that we have given for Q2, Q2 is generally a lower sales quarter for us just from a seasonality standpoint. As you look at the operating costs, a portion of being fixed as a percentage of that, it obviously would bring down our operating margins. So that is certainly one factor. 
And then also, there are some mix effects within Q4 being a heavier EGM quarter, but we are -- we increased our CSOI and our income, as well as our implied operating margin for the year based on certainly some of the things that we saw in Q1. Based on the range we have given, we are certainly cautiously optimistic about the rest of the year and the total year. 
Operator
Our next question is from Imran Khan from JP Morgan. 
Imran Khan - JP Morgan
Thank you very much for taking my questions, two questions; first, if I look at your EGM growth rate in the international market, it decelerated 16 percentage points on a year-over-year basis from 50 to 34. I am just trying to understand if there’s anything specific to this quarter. How should we think about the EGM growth rate in the international market, excluding foreign exchange going forward? 
Secondly, clearly Amazon Prime was a big success in the U.S. Are you thinking to roll it out in the international market? Thank you. 
Thomas J. Szkutak
Sure. In terms of our international EGM growth, it was 34%, so it was solid growth for the quarter but it was down from what it has been more recently. What we did see though was a, on a units basis, we saw an acceleration of unit growth in Q1 for international EGM versus what we have seen in recent quarters. Part of that is this mix that we talked about for third party with the launching of merchants in a few of the countries that I mentioned earlier, so we are pleased certainly with the unit growth that we saw. 
In terms of Prime, we are certainly very happy with what we are seeing in North America and we will have to wait and see what that means going forward as it relates to other geographies. 
Operator
Our last question today comes from Jordan Rohan from RBC Capital. 
Jordan Rohan - RBC Capital Markets
Thanks. Over the last quarter or so, both Google and Yahoo!, the major paid search engines, have made changes to their algorithms which should I would think benefit Amazon as a strong brand in the placement and the efficiency of its paid search campaign. While I know paid search is not a huge driver of the operating costs, and specifically the sales and marketing, can you speak to whether this had an impact on your efficiency and how you think about it going forward? 
Thomas J. Szkutak
No, I really do not have any comments related to that at all. 
Jordan Rohan - RBC Capital Markets
Thank you very much. 
Kim Nelson
-- on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available at our investor relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter. 
Thomas J. Szkutak
Thank you. 
Jeffrey P. Bezos

Tom Szkutak
Thanks, Kim. We demonstrated significant sequential improvement in operating leverage, achieving 4% positive leverage in Q4 from negative 11% in Q3. Operating leverage is the change in consolidated segment operating income relative to the change in sales. 
We increased Q4 CSOI by 24% year over year, as we grew gross profit by $183 million but operating costs by only $139 million. This marks a substantial improvement in leverage versus the other three quarters of 2006, as we lapped the higher spending in technology and content and gross profit dollars grew faster than operating expenses, driven by accelerated revenue growth. 
In 2006, free cash flow decreased 8% to $486 million, largely reflective of our negative operating leverage during the first three quarters of the year. Sequentially, trailing 12 month free cash flow increased $119 million compared with Q3, an improvement of 33%. Worldwide revenue grew 34% to $3.99 billion or 30% excluding the $122 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in exchange rates. Worldwide unit growth was 23%, and active customer accounts exceeded 64 million, up 16%. 
Media revenue increased to $2.5 billion, up 25% or 21% excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM revenue increased to $1.4 billion, up 55% or 51% excluding FX. Worldwide EGM increased to 35% of worldwide sales, up from 30%. For the first time, non-media dollar growth exceeded media dollar growth, even though media grew 25% in the quarter. 
Worldwide gross profit increased $183 million or grew 27% to $850 million in Q4. Gross margin decreased 108 basis points to 21.3% from product and third-party mix, lowering prices for customers in Amazon Prime. Worldwide active seller accounts were over 1.1 million, and third-party units representing marketplace and merchants@ units sold on Amazon sites, or 25% of total units versus 28% in the prior year. 
Third-party mix decreased as we transitioned to our new toys, baby and video games stores in the US which are now, like most of our stores, a combination of Amazon retail and third-party sales. Worldwide revenue growth benefited by approximately 160 basis points year over year from sales in these categories and excluding these categories, third-party units as a percentage of total units increased year over year. 
From an OpEx standpoint, we achieved the slowest growth rate in total segment operating expenses in over two years. G&A declined year over year, which reflects a benefit related to insurance recoveries of $8 million. 
Now, I will talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense line items. In the North America segment, revenue grew 31% to $2.21 billion, setting a six-year growth rate record. Media revenue grew 21% to $1.25 billion, fueled by double-digit growth across all categories: books, music, movies, video games and software. EGM revenue grew 51% to $876 million, representing 40% of North America revenues, up from 34%. North America gross profit grew 27% to $532 million, and gross margin decreased 76 basis points to 24.1% from product and third-party mix, lowering prices including free shipping and Amazon Prime. North America segment operating income increased 33% to $122 million, a 5.5% operating margin. 
In the international segment, revenue grew 37% to $1.78 billion. Revenue growth was 28% adjusting for the $121 million year-over-year favorable FX impact during the quarter. Media revenue grew 29% to $1.25 billion or 21% excluding FX. EGM revenue grew 63% to $523 million or 50% excluding FX. This is the first time international EGM has surpassed $0.5 billion in sales in a quarter. EGM now represents 29% of international revenues, up from 25%. 
International gross profit grew 28% to $318 million, or grew 19% excluding FX, while gross margin decreased 135 basis points to 17.9%, which reflects lowering prices, product mix and free shipping offers, offset partially by increased third-party mix. International segment operating income increased $14 million or 15% to $106 million, a 6% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange rates, international operating income increased 6%. 
CSOI grew 24% to $229 million or 5.7% of net sales. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 20% to $197 million or 4.9% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $91 million in Q4, compared to a benefit of $38 million in the prior year that resulted from the determination that certain of our deferred tax assets were realizable. 
Our annual effective tax rate was 50%. Our effective tax rate was higher than the 35% statutory rate, primarily due to taxable income associated with the transfer of certain operating assets in connection with establishing our EU headquarters in Luxembourg. We expect our effective tax rate in 2007 to be approximately 35% or less. 
However, there is potential for significant volatility of our effective tax rate due to several factors, including from variability in accurately predicting the amount and mix of taxable income by jurisdiction. We are endeavoring to optimize our global taxes on a cash paid basis, not for tax expense on a financial reporting basis. In 2006, we paid $15 million in cash taxes and in 2007, we expect cash taxes paid to be approximately $25 million as we continue to benefit from NOLs. 
GAAP net income was $98 million or $0.23 per diluted share, compared with $199 million and $0.47 per diluted share. 
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $19 million to $2.02 billion. In Q1 2006, we repurchased EUR250 million of convertible debt, and in Q3 2006 we repurchased 252 million of our common stock or 8 million shares. Inventory increased 55% to $877 million, and inventory turns decreased from 14 to 13, as we expanded selection and improved in-stock levels across product categories and geographies and introduced new product categories. 
Our investment in net fixed assets, which includes net capitalized software development costs, increased $109 million from a year ago to $457 million. Our 2006 capital expenditures were $216 million, of which half were software development costs. Our return on invested capital was 29%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus average current liabilities. 
I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. However, there is a high-level of uncertainty surrounding fluctuations in the euro, pound, yen, Canadian dollar and yuan exchange rates, as well as the global economy and consumer spending and the impact on both of world events. While we are cautiously optimistic, it is not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
Let me also remind everyone that we mark our euro-denominated debt to market at the end of each quarter, which results in a gain or loss for any movement in the euro between reporting dates. We also have euro exposure related to our interest expense on this euro-denominated debt. We incur a foreign currency gain or loss corresponding with intercompany balances denominated in foreign currencies, which are settled among subsidiaries. Depending on the amount and timing and unfavorable resolution of outstanding legal matters that could materially affect our business, results of operations, financial position or cash flows in a particular period. 
Our effective tax rate is subject to significant variations, based on changes in our corporate structure and business operations; the amount of expenses incurred that are permanently nondeductible for US tax purposes, such as stock-based compensation paid to foreign employees; the tax characterization of income earned; changes in current tax laws; and changes in estimates, including accurately predicting our taxable income in the taxable jurisdictions to which it relates. 
Our guidance assumes that we don't record any additional intangible assets or any further revisions to stock-based compensation or our restructuring-related estimates and that FX rates remain approximately where they have been recently. 
For Q1, we expect net sales of between $2.85 billion and $3 billion, or growth of between 25% and 32%. This guidance anticipates greater than 300 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be between $82 million and $122 million or between a 22% decline and 16% growth. This includes approximately $38 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $120 million and $160 million, or approximately flat to 33% growth. 
For the calendar year 2007, we expect net sales of between $13 billion and $13.7 billion, or growth of between 21% and 28%. This guidance anticipates approximately 100 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be between $355 million and $505 million, or between a 9% decline and 30% growth. This includes approximately $165 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $520 million and $670 million, or between 4% growth and 34% growth. 
We anticipate our 2007 free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to our operating profit growth rate year over year, with some variability from changes in working capital. We expect capital expenditures, including capitalized software development costs, to be approximately $250 million. We will continue to strive for year-over-year annual growth in free cash flow and free cash flow per share, while investing in our long-term opportunities. 
We are confident that if we continue to improve the customer experience and execute efficiently, our value proposition as well as our free cash flow will expand. 
Thanks and with that, Kim, let's move to questions. 
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Justin Post - Merrill Lynch. 
Justin Post – Merrill Lynch
Could you talk a little bit about your gross margin trends embedded in your outlook for next year? Also, can you talk a little bit about this quarter? If we look at year-over-year incremental gross margins as around 18% on a year-over-year basis, why was it down versus your overall gross margin? Can you tell us what the Toys-R-Us impact was this quarter? 
Tom Szkutak
Sure. As you look at our total year guidance for next year, we are not splitting out the individual pieces, giving guidance on the individual line items -- so we're not giving guidance on gross margin, for example. But the way you should think about it is we will certainly have lower prices next year, continued COGS reductions, as well as we think certainly we're going to be adding more third-party sellers. So again, I think those are some of the key dynamics as you look at our gross margins next year. 
Could you repeat the second part of your question, Justin? I couldn't hear that. 
Justin Post – Merrill Lynch
Sure. When we look at the year-over-year incremental gross margin, it seems to be around 18%, based on the numbers you report. But some of that was probably due to Toys-R-Us. So I'm wondering if you could help us understand what the impact was on this year's or last year's gross margin from Toys-R-Us. 
Tom Szkutak
Yes. In terms of the Toys-R-Us impact, I can't help you, but I can say, from a revenue perspective, we certainly had both retail and third parties as it relates to toys, baby and video games; that impacted our total revenue by approximately 160 basis points. But in terms of the margin, we are not disclosing the specific margin related to that part of the business. 
Justin Post – Merrill Lynch
Thanks. Good media sales. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Anthony Noto - Goldman Sachs. 
 Anthony Noto - Goldman Sachs 
A comment on two things. One, your new active customers totaled 2 million in the quarter, which is a decline year over year of about 38%, and last quarter was also a decline of about 13%. So we see an acceleration there. I'm just wondering, do you think that the new active customer growth will continue to decline in 2007? 
Second, I know that 2006 was an investment year. But if I look at 2005 versus your outlook for 2007, it appears at the midpoint that you'll add about $4.9 billion of incremental revenue and only about $31 million of incremental operating income. I just wonder, when do you think the model will show leverage, where an incremental dollar of revenue will really drive incremental operating income and free cash flow? Thank you. 
Tom Szkutak
Sure. If you look at the active customers, it's actually up 16% year over year. What you're seeing is -- certainly we're seeing, with the revenue growth year over year excluding exchange rates, you're seeing a 30% growth. So we're getting more share of wallet from customers. 
If you could just repeat, sorry, the second part of the questions, related to the leverage? That was from 2005 to 2007? 
 Anthony Noto - Goldman Sachs 
Yes. I'm really just trying to understand, I know that 2006 was an investment year, and I think a lot of investors, including us, were hoping for some leverage in 2007. But now it appears that your operating income margins will be down in 2007 at the midpoint versus 2006 after an investment year. So I went back to 2005 and said, what has happened over that time period? It looks like you revenue will grow almost $5 billion, but your operating income would not have increased at all over that time period. 
Tom Szkutak
Right. What you're seeing is we had an increase in our cost base both in 2005 and 2006. Certainly, we spent a lot of time talking about technology and content over the past few calls. You've seen that that growth rate has slowed, and so when you look at 2007, you should expect that our growth from an annual basis will be significantly less than it was in 2006. 
But what certainly has happened from 2006 to 2005 is on top of that, you had gross margins coming down. The primary reason for that, there's certainly a lot of different factors, but certainly lower prices, the mix of categories that we're in; we entered a lot of new categories with new selection, and so that is driving it, as well as we were certainly helped throughout the course of the year by third-party sales. 
So as you think about it going forward, even though you have seen the gross margins come down, a lot of these newer categories are becoming much more meaningful for us and over time, we will be able to get those margins to be very solid within our business. 
Today, as you can imagine, with some of the new categories that we have, what we're trying to do is get to scale. When we get to scale on those particular categories, good things happen. Think about particularly in international, where we are very, very small within EGM just a few years ago, and now it's become a much more meaningful part of our business. 
When that happens, we're able to get a lot more traffic to those particular categories. When that happens, you get a lot more third-party sellers coming to sell on our detail pages. We also get better prices with suppliers as their volume grows. So again, our strategy is to grow those businesses. Even though you see the gross margin going down, and that being one contributor of it, it's something that we are very happy with, because we need to get the scale in those businesses. Over time, that will be very beneficial to shareholders. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Brian Pitz - Banc of America. 
 Brian Pitz - Banc of America 
Thank you. A couple of questions. On operating margins, the split between US and international, can you talk about how we should think about that going forward? Are they pretty close to parity? It looks like in the current quarter they are, but just any thoughts on 2007 and beyond? 
And then, web services, can you comment on the revenue opportunity there and potential timing? Are you factoring in any revenue from web services for 2007 in your guidance? Any kind of update on that would be great. Thanks. 
Tom Szkutak
Sure. First, on the segments, the operating margins and how you should think about them, in addition to the comments I made about many of the categories that make up EGM in terms of that scale, we're certainly further ahead in scale in our North America segment in some of those categories, particularly, say, in consumer electronics. We have been selling in that category for a longer period of time. 
But certainly, as you think about the two different segments, one thing that you should be aware of: our third-party penetration overall, we said, is 25%. Over the past several quarters, certainly we have had a much bigger penetration in terms of third-party units as a percentage of total in our North America segment versus our international segment. That is because we have been selling third-party units, particularly Merchants@ units in North America for a longer period of time. With the launch of Merchants@ international, more recently, that's certainly an opportunity for us to grow over time. 
Then if you look at again, our EGM penetration is just a much smaller rate within international. So again, there's an opportunity to improve a lot more from the third party business vis-a-vis North America. But again, I think we have opportunities, really, in both segments to improve our operating margins over time. 
Then the second part of your question, web services. 
Jeff Bezos
The Amazon Web Services team has a number of different web services. They have the simple storage service, which allows you to store data in the Internet cloud, and then it's securely stored and you can retrieve it. It's self-service, it's very inexpensive; developers really like it. There's also EC2, which is the Elastic Compute Cloud. It does the same thing, but with compute instead of data. There's also e-commerce services, there's Mechanical Turk. So there are a number of things. There's Alexa Web Services. These services are getting a lot of adoption, and developers really love them, getting a lot of buzz in the blogsphere, being heavily used by startup companies. 
As far as their impact on the financials, it will take some time before they have enough scale to have a meaningful impact that becomes visible, given the scale of our other businesses. So with a $10 billion business, even though these businesses are doing very well, it's going to take some number of years before they become meaningful. But we're thrilled with the progress, and that team is just doing a bang-up job. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Scott Devitt - Stifel Nicolaus. 
 Scott Devitt - Stifel Nicolaus 
Thank you. The domestic business, revenue growth accelerated from 21% last quarter to 31% this quarter. I understand a component that is the toys. So I was wondering if you could give us a normalized domestic growth rate. But beyond that, there was still acceleration, so if you could categorize where the growth was coming from -- new categories, the loyalty related to Prime, new customers or otherwise? 
Tom Szkutak
The impact worldwide of toys, baby and videogames was approximately 160 basis points, and that translates into approximately 300 basis points for North America. So if you adjust that from the 31% you get about 28%.You are right, we did see very nice sequential growth versus third quarter, and really all of the quarters was the best growth rate overall in six years. 
There was a number of different reasons for that, but certainly Prime adoption was certainly one. The fact that we, as you noticed, we worked very hard during the year, in terms of making sure that we had great low prices. We expanded unique selection considerably year over year. In addition to the unique selection, we improved a lot, particularly in the second half, on our in-stock levels. So the combination of all these factors is really what helped the North America growth in Q4. 
 Scott Devitt - Stifel Nicolaus 
Thank you. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Mark Mahaney - Citigroup. 
 Mark Mahaney - Citigroup 
Thank you very much. It looks like there has been a fair number of small merchants coming over and trying third-party sales on Amazon. What are you going to get those? Is that purely inbounds, or are you also trying to go out to other marketplaces and attract third-party sellers? Any quick comments on the product results so far for Amazon Unbox, and maybe implications that could have for broader digital downloading strategies? Thank you very much. 
Tom Szkutak
I think from a third-party perspective, one of the things you're seeing is when we add the amount of unique selection that we continue to add, and just some of the category expansion and the traffic to those category expansions, that's naturally attracting more third-party sellers. So that's something I talked about a little bit earlier and something that we want to continue to do. 
Jeff Bezos
We do have an outreach program, and it's very effective. But most of that activity is inbound. It's people just knowing, they see other sellers on the website, and they want to get their selection into that competitive mix so the website sort of serves as its own advertisement for sellers. That's a very effective and obviously very low-cost way of attracting new sellers. But the outbound reach is also very effective. 
Tom Szkutak
Then on digital, the second part of your question, there's still a bunch of things in our pipeline that we will be rolling out over time. So I encourage you to stay tuned. 
 Mark Mahaney - Citigroup 
Thank you very much. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Safa Rashtchy - Piper Jaffray. 
 Safa Rashtchy - Piper Jaffray 
Thank you and good afternoon. Could you give us a little bit more color on the dynamics of the gross margins, in particular? As I see it, this is the lowest gross margins you have recorded in the past five years. I understand the rationale you're giving, that you're growing the top line. But the dynamics that you mentioned like the partnerships, the third-party sales, the lower prices on Prime, have been with you, certainly throughout the past year and yet the margins have not been this low. 
So to what degree are you getting the growth from the lower prices? Also, what can we expect, how low can we expect the margins going forward? Tied to that, do you still have any goals of double-digit operating margins? 
Tom Szkutak
In terms of gross margin, I briefly mentioned this earlier in the call. There's a number of different dynamics, and you mentioned some of them. Lower prices were certainly one of them. But I think the one that you should certainly take a look at is the mix of products. Again, I think that's something that we actually like. Our non-media dollar growth worldwide for the first time was actually higher than our media growth, from a dollar standpoint. 
Again, what that is telling us, as we look at it, is it's helping us get to scale in a lot of these individual categories. We still have a lot of work to do, to do that, but again, we're starting to see some meaningful changes with such high growth rates, with growth rates over 50% in EGM worldwide. So very, very strong across the board growth rates in a lot of categories. So those growth rates are going to help us. 
Then compounded on top of that, as we continue to grow in those categories, is really going to help us get to scale, help us to continue to get better traffic, which will help us get third parties. Certainly, the third parties will help us expand margins, as well as get better prices as our volume gets bigger with many of these suppliers. 
So again, that's what's going on there. That's something that we're trying to do to try to get that improving over time. 
Safa Rashtchy - Piper Jaffray 
Any target on the operating margin going forward? 
Tom Szkutak
The operating margin certainly, as we said before, we focus on operating profit dollars. We start first with free cash flow dollars, then operating profit dollars. But certainly, we still think there's a lot of room, from an operating margin standpoint. 
Jeff Bezos
We haven't changed our long-term view about what the model can be. 
Tom Szkutak
Correct. 
 Safa Rashtchy - Piper Jaffray
Thank you.

Your next question comes from Robert Peck - Bear Stearns. 
 Robert Peck - Bear Stearns 
My question sort of ties into Brian's a little bit there. He was talking about the revenue opportunity from Amapedia, EC2, Askville, et cetera. Could you tell us a little bit about what is being invested into that, and when we may see a pare back of some of that? 
As part of that question, Endless.com, you are doing the negative shipping offers. Some believe that could be a testing ground for Amazon.com someday. Is negative shipping one of the options of where Amazon could go? 
Jeff Bezos
Well, you are referring to our new shoe site, Endless.com. Endless.com, as a standard practice, offers free overnight shipping as well as a 110% price guarantee, 365-day returns and pre-return shipping, too. So that's the standard practice. But through February, Endless is offering negative $5 overnight shipping. It's an unusual promotion that we're doing to draw attention to Endless.com, so that we can introduce it to our customers and that's working very effectively. 
 Robert Peck - Bear Stearns 
Is that's something that's on the table that, should it be successful, could be ported to Amazon.com? 
Jeff Bezos
You know, that's not something that we have considered. This is a special promotion just through the month of February. We're getting such great traction with our standard practices of Free Super Saver Shipping on Amazon for orders over $25, as well as we have equivalent programs around the world. Also, of course, for Amazon Prime members, you pay $79 a year for unlimited free two-day shipping. That program, as you know, has also been met with a lot of adoption. So we are very excited about those, and we haven't considered the negative shipping beyond Endless.com. 
 Robert Peck - Bear Stearns 
The first part of that question was the investment. Can you give us any sort of gauge of what's the investment into all of these endeavors, and when we may get to see some leverage on it? 
Jeff Bezos
Well, the big investments are in digital and web services. Other things that you mentioned are very minor investments. 
 Robert Peck - Bear Stearns 
Thank you. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank Securities. 
 Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank Securities 
Great, thank you. Two questions. As you look at your technology and content investment, about $600 million, that's what you spent in 2006, but what is intended for the growth of the existing business versus new businesses and ventures? 
Second question, if you look on a contribution profit basis, do you think that just broadly, the ecommerce industry unit economics mirror what you're doing or do you think you're artificially surpassing overall the unit economics of the business by using a low price strategy? I'm trying to figure out whether your view is that the industry's profitability moves to your model, or you actually have been holding it back for the past couple of years. 
Tom Szkutak
In terms of the first question, in terms of technology and content, we have not given a split in terms of what, if I understood the question, what is for the core part of the business and what is for future. But certainly, it's being spent on a number of different initiatives. Jeff mentioned a few of them. Certainly, we're making investments in terms of the incremental spend, which we're spending that largely on web services, digital, new categories as we launch them, seller platforms, making it easier for sellers to sell. So those are certainly key investment areas for the business. 
Could you maybe repeat or restate the second part of the question? 
 Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank Securities 
Yes. If you look at the overall variable profitability in your business, is your thesis on your aggressive pricing strategy to end customers that overall unit economics will migrate across the ecommerce market towards your model, in terms of, call it about a couple of dollars per transaction? Or do you think that you've been holding it back as a way to grow your volume in the near term in this growth environment? 
Jeff Bezos
I suspect that what we will see over time is that there will be multiple winners of different scales pursuing different strategies in that regard. So you may see that it probably doesn't end up being one size fits all. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Douglas Anmuth - Lehman Brothers. 
 Douglas Anmuth - Lehman Brothers 
Thank you. Your results suggest that Prime is really doing what you would like it to do, based on the top line growth, the lower gross margins and also the flattish shipping revenues, despite the 34% increase in sales. So this is a program that has been in place for almost two years now. Can you give us some sense of metrics around Prime, and also discuss the usage patterns during the holiday? 
Then can you also talk about to what degree Prime customers are more or less price-sensitive than other shoppers? Thank you. 
Jeff Bezos
Sure. In terms of Prime customers, what we're seeing right now is adoption is very strong, Prime customers are certainly buying more from us, so we're getting a bigger share of wallet from those particular customers. They're also doing more cross-shopping. 
Beyond that, at this time, we're not disclosing other statistics or metrics around Prime. That said, though, it's something that from a business perspective, we do spend a lot of time on and continue to look at very closely. We like what we see, and so that's something that we think we certainly want to continue to grow that business and subscribers continue to grow nicely. We look forward to having more Prime customers because we think over the long term it's a great win for customers. Customers are seeing that today, and we think it will be great for shareholders over the long term as well. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Paul Keung - CIBC World Markets. 
 Paul Keung - CIBC World Markets 
I hate to ask the question again, but it's important, I guess, when you look at Amazon Prime, is the economics of a Prime customer very different than that of the average customer on the platform? I'm trying to understand whether this in itself long-term is going to be accretive to the overall platform. 
Jeff Bezos
Yes. We certainly believe that it is, and we like the trends that we see. They are very positive, and we think certainly would be very helpful over the long term. 
 Paul Keung - CIBC World Markets 
So it's equal or better for the economics then, is probably the right way to think about it on a transactional basis? 
Jeff Bezos
Again, the way we're looking at it today, we were very pleased at the start of Prime, when we launched it. We continue to see favorable trends. We have found ways to become more productive with some of the volume we're getting with Prime customers. There's things that we think we can do over the long term to make it even better from an economic standpoint. So we're continuing to try to innovate on behalf of both customers and make it better for shareholders over time. But we like what we see so far, and we need to continue to make it even better. 
 Paul Keung - CIBC World Markets 
The toys category, how fast did that category grow year over year this quarter? 
Jeff Bezos
We're not breaking out any subcategory details. But again, the impact of toys, video games and baby was 160 basis points on our total revenue year over year. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Imran Khan – JP Morgan. 
 Imran Khan – JP Morgan 
Thank you for taking my question. I have a couple of questions. Your inventory was up 51% year over year, which is a slight deceleration from last quarter’s growth rate, but still pretty strong growth. So I am trying to understand where this growth is coming from. Is it toy category or some other categories? 
Secondly, I was wondering if you could give us some color what kind of user impact you're seeing from the introduction of the Unbox product? 
Jeff Bezos 
 In terms of the inventory question, we continued to add a lot of selection, a lot of unique selection during 2006. So that was certainly a driver. We also worked on improving in-stock selection over the course of 2006, which is why you are seeing the growth that you're seeing. Certainly, this is something that will have some volatility over time, but certainly you should expect that over time it will flatten off to potentially trickle upwards from a turn perspective. So that's how we're thinking about it. 
In terms of Unbox, we continue to add selection at Unbox. We're getting very good repeat customer performance back to our site. So we are very pleased from that perspective. The team is seeing especially strong performance amongst television episodes, as well as hard to find video. As Tom said, of all of our category offerings, it has amongst the highest repeat rates so we're very encouraged by that. 
 Imran Khan – JP Morgan 
Thank you. 
Operator
Your final question comes from Mark Rowen - Prudential. 
 Mark Rowen - Prudential 
Thanks. Tom, could you tell us how much video game consoles helped the North American media growth, given the strength in Xbox and your allocation in Wii's PS3's? Then on the gross margin, just a follow-up on that. It looks like the free shipping as a percent of revenue wasn't really any greater than it was a year ago. So my question is, was it primarily the promotional environment where you had to match competitive prices from other retailers, or was it primarily mix shift to lower margin categories that caused the gross margin erosion year over year? 
Tom Szkutak
In terms of any specific product details on the consoles, we just don't break out that level of detail from a disclosure standpoint. In terms of the net shipping margin, you are right, it was flat at 3.1%. Certainly, the shift to our new toys, baby and video category impacted that. We talked about Prime impacting that as well. Offsetting that, we had some very good productivity as well, so those were the key drivers. 
 Mark Rowen - Prudential 
I'm sorry? Productivity in --? 
Tom Szkutak
Within transportation. 
 Mark Rowen - Prudential 
I see. I'm not asking for the number on video games, but just directionally, did that help the growth rate to a material degree? 
Tom Szkutak
I would say it this way. We are certainly not breaking that out, and within our media categories as well as our EGM categories, as you can see from the release, both from North America and from international, we had very strong growth across the board. Beyond that, there's not a lot I can share with you. 
 Mark Rowen - Prudential 
Okay, thanks. 
Kim Nelson
Thanks, Mark. Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon, and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

Tom Szkutak
Thanks, Kim. I will begin with comments on our financial results. The trailing 12-month free cash flow declined 23% to $366 million, driven primarily by our increased expenditure in technology and content. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 435 million shares compared with 438 million, down 1%. During the quarter we repurchased 8 million shares or $252 million under our previously announced authorization to repurchase up to $500 million of the Company's common stock. 
Return on invested capital is 23%. ROIC is free cash flow divided by average total assets minus average current liabilities. Revenue grew 24% to $2.3 billion or 23%, excluding the $20 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. In Q3 2005, worldwide revenue benefited by 260 basis points of year-over-year growth from Harry Potter 6, plus preorder attachments. Excluding Harry Potter 6 plus preorder attachments and changes in FX, revenue growth was 26%. Worldwide unit growth was 22% or 24%, excluding HP 6 plus attachments. 
Active customer accounts surpassed 61 million, up 17%. Electronics and other general merchandise, or EGM, increased to $699 million, up 43%, or 41% excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM represents 30% of worldwide sales up from 26%. 
Gross profit grew 18% to $549 million in Q3. Gross margins decreased 113 basis points to 23.8%, which reflects lower product prices for customers, greater shipping loss driven by free shipping in Amazon Prime, and product mix. 
Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content and G&A combined was $477 million or 20.7% of sales, up 227 basis points. Fulfillment was $209 million or 9.1% of sales, up 11 basis points. We opened a new fulfillment center in Leipzig, Germany which is now fully operational. Marketing was $63 million, or 2.7 percent of sales, up 45 basis points. Technology and content was $156 million, up 45% year-over-year or 6.8% of sales, up 98 basis points year-over-year and down 31 basis points as a percentage of sales from Q2. 
We are investing in technology to innovate in areas such as seller platforms, web services and digital. Additionally, we continue to invest in increasing selection. In the last 12 months we have increased selection of unique products carried in our warehouses by over 50%. In addition to adding to our category leadership and buying teams for existing categories, we have added additional resources in new categories. You should expect we will continue to add selection over time. We expect the year-over-year percentage growth in technology and content to continue to decrease in Q4 2006. 
G&A was $49 million or 2.1% of sales, up 72 basis points. As a reminder, in Q3 '05, we recorded a $12 million expense reduction related to actual and expected reimbursement by an insurer of certain legal costs that had been previously incurred by us. 
Now we will talk about our segment results. Consistent with prior periods, we don't allocate stock-based compensation or other operating expense to our segments. In the North America segment, revenue grew 21% to $1.26 billion. Media revenue grew 15% to $785 million even though the comparison quarter last year included the release of Harry Potter 6. 
EGM grew 35% to $409 million, representing 33% of North America revenues up from 29%. Gross profit grew 17% to $343 million and gross margin decreased 78 basis points to 27.3%, primarily from lowering prices including free shipping at Amazon Prime as well as product mix. The North America segment operating income decreased 67% to $22 million, a 1.7% operating margin. 
In the International segment, revenue grew 29% to $1.05 billion. Revenue growth was 26%, adjusting for the $18 million year-over-year favorable FX impact during the quarter. Media revenue grew 20% to $757 million or 19% excluding FX. EGM revenue grew 55% to $290 million or 51%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates. EGM represents 28% of international revenues, up from 23%. Gross profit grew 21% to $206 million or grew 18% excluding FX, while gross margin decreased 130 basis points to 19.6%, which reflects price decreases and product mix. International segment operating income decreased $4 million or 8% to $50 million, a 4.8% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impacts of foreign exchange, international operating income decreased 9%. 
The combination of operating income in our North American and International segments is our consolidated segment operating income or CSOI. Our segment information in our press release reconciled CSOI to GAAP operating income. CSOI declined 40% to $72 million. The decline in operating income was mainly due to technology and content investments. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 28% to $40 million. Third quarter 2005 operating income included a negative impact of $40 million, related to a patent litigation settlement. 
Our provision for income taxes was $19 million in Q3 and our current estimate of our annual effective tax rate is 51%. Our effective tax rate remains higher than the 35% statutory rate, primarily due to taxable income associated with the transfer of certain operating assets in connection with establishing our EU Headquarters in Luxembourg. 
We expect these assets transfers to beneficially impact our effective tax rate over time. Since we have deferred tax assets related to our NOLs, these asset transfers will not have a significant impact on our cash taxes paid in 2006, which we expect to be approximately $25 million compared with $12 million in 2005. We are endeavoring to optimize our global taxes on a cash paid basis, not for tax expense on a financial reporting basis. 
GAAP net income was $19 million or $0.05 per diluted share compared with $30 million and $0.07 per diluted share. 
Turning to the balance sheet, cash from marketable securities decreased $199 million to $1.2 billion. As a reminder, we repurchased $252 million of our common stock in the third quarter. Inventory increased 61% to $736 million and turns decreased 11% to 13.2 as we expanded selection and improved in-stock levels across product categories. 
Our investment in net fixed assets, which includes net capitalized software development costs, increased to $449 million. Our capital expenditures were $62 million for Q3, of which $28 million were software development costs. 
Our growth continues to be fueled by our relentless focus on the primary inputs of customer experience, convenience, selection and price. Some recent examples of our progress include Amazon Prime. In Q3 '06 we continued to see strong quarter-to-quarter sequential growth for new Prime memberships. We continue to see increased purchases by Amazon Prime customers across more categories, with especially heavy purchases in electronics, kitchen, and health and personal care. 
We launched Amazon Unbox, a digital video download service offering customers thousands of television shows, movies, and other video content from more then 30 studio and network partners from Hollywood and around the world; and we're pleased to introduce even more selection with our recent addition of Showtime Premium programming. 
Amazon Business Solutions launched, in beta, Web Store by Amazon and Fulfillment by Amazon, giving small and medium-sized businesses access to Amazon's order fulfillment, customer service, and customer shipping offers and underlying website technology. 
Our Japanese website launched its health and beauty store, offering customers a selection of over 35,000 items in 12 categories including supplements, drinking water and soft drinks, condiments, processed foods and health foods as well as cosmetics and products for bath care, nursing care and relaxation. 
Our Automotive Parts and Accessories store now has over 1million automotive products offered by Amazon in leading mass market and specialty retailers. In Q3 we saw a wide range of auto part purchases from air filters, shock absorbers, and handheld diagnostics scanners to a recon engine Ford 302 5 liter Xtreme OHV Remanufactured long block engine that we delivered to a customer in Spokane, Washington. 
Amazon's innovative Part Finder allows owners of approximately 10,000 different cars and truck models to find the correct replacement parts, performance parts, or accessories for their vehicle. 
Amazon Web services launched in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, Amazon EC2, in limited public beta. Amazon EC2 is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity, making web scale computing easier for developers. Just as Amazon Simple Storage Service, Amazon S3, enables Storage in the Cloud, Amazon EC2 enables Compute in the Cloud. Developers continue to adopt Amazon's web services. Over 200,000 have registered to date up greater than 60% year-over-year. 
Third-party sales remains a key part of our selection expansion. Worldwide active seller accounts were approximately 1.1 million and third-party units representing marketplace and merchants units sold on Amazon sites were 30% of total units, flat with the prior year. Additionally, our international third-party business expanded with the launch of Merchants@ in the UK and Germany. 
Some pricing highlights include the average customer discount for music purchased on www.amazon.com increased more than 350 basis points year-over-year. The average customer discount for DVDs purchased on www.amazon.com increased more than 200 basis points year-over-year. Over the past 12 months, customers have saved over $0.5 billion on shipping through our worldwide free shipping offers in Amazon Prime. 
I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance of the order trends we have seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. However, there's a high level of uncertainty surrounding fluctuation in the euro, pound, yen, Canadian dollar and yuan exchange rates, as well as the global economy and consumer spending and the impact on both of world events. While we are cautiously optimistic, it is not possible to accurately predict demand; and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
Let me also remind everyone that we mark our euro-denominated debt to market at the end of each quarter which results in a gain or loss for any movement in the euro between reporting dates. We also have euro exposure related to our interest expense on this euro-denominated debt. We incur a foreign currency gain or loss corresponding with intra-company balances denominated in foreign currencies which are settled among subsidiaries. Depending on the amount and timing, an unfavorable resolution of outstanding legal matters could materially affect our business results of operations, financial position, or cash flows in a particular period. 
Our effective tax rate is subject to a significant variation based on changes in our corporate structure and business operations, the amount of expenses incurred that are permanently non-deductible for U.S tax purposes such as stock-based compensation paid to foreign employees; the tax characterization of income earned; changes in current tax laws; and changes in estimates including accurately predicting our taxable income and the taxable jurisdictions to which it relates. 
Our guidance assumes that we won't record any additional intangible assets or any further revisions to stock-based compensation or our restructuring-related estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently. 
For Q4, we expect net sales of between $3.625 billion and $3.95 billion, a growth of between 22% and 33%. This guidance anticipates approximately 225 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be between $145 million and to $235 million or between a 12% decline and 43% growth. This includes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets of approximately $35 million. 
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $180 million and $270 million or between a 3% decline and 46% growth. 
For the calendar year 2006, we expect net sales of between $10.35 billion and $10.675 billion, a growth of between 22% and 26%. This guidance anticipates a small negative impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be between $339 million and $429 million or between a 22% decline and a 1% decline. This includes approximately $113 million of stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. 
We anticipate Consolidated Segment Operating Income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $452 million and $542 million, or a 20% decline and 4% decline. As you can see from our guidance, we expect operating leverage will show significant sequential improvement in the fourth quarter. 
We anticipate our 2006 free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to our operating profit growth rate year-over-year with some variability from changes in working capital. This excludes the impact of FAS 123R, which could be up to $100 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation being classified as positive financing cash flows instead of operating cash flows, up from $7 million in 2005. 
We expect capital expenditures, including capitalized software development costs, to be approximately $225 million We will continue to strive for year-over-year annual growth of free cash flow and free cash flow per share while investing in our long-term opportunities. We are confident that if we continue to improve customer experience and execute efficiently, our value proposition as well as our free cash flow will expand. 
Thanks, and with that, Kim, let's move to questions. 
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank. 
 Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank 
Two questions. You historically have talked about overall profit margins and cash flow margin percentages not important or indicative of the business strategy. Can you just give us a sense of how we should think about the operating profile or your game plan in areas like web services, business solutions and social networking services? I have a quick follow-up. 
Tom Szkutak
Certainly when you think of web services and some of the other areas that you mentioned, it's very early. So it's certainly something we are very optimistic about over the long term. In terms of projecting anything near term, I don't think it is appropriate to do so. 
 Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank 
Do you look at those businesses that are in this nascent mode today as ways to fuel the growth of the core franchise? Or is it leveraging the existing infrastructure and assets that you have built out over the past nine years and putting them to use in the marketplace? How do you look at new business versus driving the existing operation? 
Tom Szkutak
It is some of both. We certainly think that this can be a meaningful business over the long term and can have an impact on the overall economics of the company. The reason we're doing the web services that we are doing is because they are things that we've gotten good at over the last 11 years in terms of building out this web scale application called Amazon.com. So as we go about exposing the guts of Amazon, there are other developers out there who require those same sorts of web scale services. So these are assets and skills that we needed to build for ourselves anyway. What we're doing here is exposing those and, over time, build that into a meaningful business. 
 Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank 
Thanks. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Anthony Noto – Goldman Sachs. 
 Anthony Noto – Goldman Sachs
Thank you very much. Tom and Jeff, in the past, when we have talked about the fact that we thought your cost of gross was increasing, you have pointed to the fact that you have been spending on elements in the P&L that don't necessarily drive revenue in the near term; technology and content. 
But as we look over the past three quarters, your marketing expense line has accelerated from 25% year-over-year growth in Q1 to 30% year-over-year growth in Q2 to 50% year-over-year growth in Q3. In your release you disclosed the fact that your marketing expense will be variable with revenue and increase or decrease depending on the competitive environment and other factors. 
So as your tech and development expense year-over-year started to decline, this other line item, which is tied directly to revenue, is starting to accelerate. So I was wondering if you could give us a little perspective on what is actually driving that increase in your cost of revenue? What do you think about the prospects for that as you go into 2007 and your ability to get back to double-digit incremental operating margins? Thanks. 
Tom Szkutak
Sure. If you take a look at our marketing expense, it has been in the range of approximately 2.2% to 2.7% over the last several quarters, 2.7% being the most recent quarter. If you look at what we've done over really the past year, we have added a lot of new selections. In fact, if you look at the unique selection that we have added under our own roof, that is up over 50% year-over-year. 
So what we're really doing is we've spent a lot of time adding selections; we have spent a lot of effort also making sure that our prices are low. So we're trying to make sure that our customers realize that we have great selection and good prices in the form of advertising. So that is what we're doing. It is still, I think, at a very modest spend level, being less than 3% of revenue. 
 Anthony Noto – Goldman Sachs
I guess it just really begs the question, is it just sort of a transition from the first year investment in technology to be able to sell the products on your site and offer them, and now you have to invest in the marketing to be able to get awareness of those products so people will buy them? When does that transition stop and we can get back to that profitability and return on your investments since your cash flow is still declining? 
Tom Szkutak
Anthony, that is not the way we are thinking about it. You should think that of it in, at least in the recent history, it's been in a lower relative range. And again, we've talked quite a bit in the past about trying to make sure that we educate customers. That is what we're doing in this case. I wouldn't think of it as a fundamental shift in any way. 
 Anthony Noto – Goldman Sachs

Your next question comes from Robert Peck - Bear Stearns. 
 Robert Peck - Bear Stearns
Hi guys, just a couple of quick questions here. First of all, touching on Jeetil's question there in a different way, when we think about products such as Askville and EC2 and S3 and all that, can you maybe breakdown for us what is the incremental spend going to those type of more technological or even social products versus the core development of the platform? That is number one. 
Number two is, could you talk to us about any integration issues or hurdles you have had building the toy store up? If there are any impacts for Q4? 
Then could you give us more details around Unbox? Any sort of statistics you have as far as downloads, streams; anything else to give a gauge on how Unbox is doing versus the other competitors out there? Thanks. 
Tom Szkutak
In terms of the question on specifics on spend, we haven't broken out technology and content in terms of the specific details. But what we've tried to do is give you some help by talking about some of the larger buckets. So if you look at the year-over-year increase, certainly you're seeing investments in web services, investments in digital, investments in the seller platform, investments in other customer experience. That is from a technology standpoint. 
In addition to that, certainly new categories. The content piece of technology and content and some of the announcements that we have made recently in terms of Automotive and other category launches are certainly part of that spend as well. 
In terms of your second part of the question on toys, we have certainly been spending a lot of time trying to improve selection in toys, certainly in a very short period of time both with retail selection as well as third-party selection. So we have been spending time certainly over the past several months doing that, making sure that we monitor prices carefully. 
So those two things we have certainly have been doing over the last several months, getting ready for the most seasonal aspect of toys, which is Q4. We have over 125,000 unique items in toys currently that we are offering. So those are things that we think over the long term toys is something that is going to be very good for customers and for shareholders. We are pleased with what we're doing there. 
In terms of the last part on Unbox, in terms of any statistics it is just very early. We are certainly pleased that we continue to add selection in Unbox but again, video is very early. We're going to continue to innovative on that over time and make the experience even better for customers.

Your next question comes from Paul Keung - CIBC World Markets. 
 Paul Keung - CIBC World Markets 
Hi, Tom. The first question is on life after Toys 'R' Us, I guess. Looking at the category, looking at where you are today versus where you would have been six months or a year ago, do you think the category will be better, the same or worse in terms of revenue growth and profitability this quarter in light of what you're going to do? 
The second question has to do with your third-party business in Europe. I am just wanting to get an update in terms of how the Marks & Spencer launch went this month. Should we start to see an acceleration in the number of new customers on that platform now that you have the big one up and running? 
Tom Szkutak
In terms of Toys 'R' Us, in terms of the revenue and the profitability, it is incorporated into our guidance in Q4. We are not breaking out the specific number within guidance. I apologize, I couldn't hear the second part of your question. Could you repeat the last part of your question? 
 Paul Keung - CIBC World Markets 
Yes, the second part of the question had to do with the third-party business in Europe. I guess with the launch of the Marks & Spencer relationship in the UK this month, I was wondering if we should start to see an acceleration and adding new partners on that third-party platform in Europe now that the bigger one is up and running? 
Tom Szkutak
In terms of the third-party platform in International we're actually pleased with it. In the comments I made earlier, we have launched merchants at International for the UK and Germany. So certainly over time you will be seeing more and more partners selling our platforms so we're actually pleased with that. 
In terms of any specific announcements on timing, we generally don't announce specific times related to launches until they happen. 
 Paul Keung - CIBC World Markets

Your next question comes from Imran Khan – JP Morgan. 
 Imran Khan – JP Morgan 
Hi, thank you very much. Tom and Jeff, two questions. You talked about the inventory and stock selection increase, but if I look at the balance sheet it seems like your inventory grew 61% year-over-year, up from 36 and 33 in Q1 and Q2. I was trying to get a better sense if there is anything you're seeing into the quarter that increases your confidence to increase that inventory at that level? 
Secondly, actually probably a very similar question, your revenue growth guidance is guiding an acceleration. Just trying to get a better sense of what are you seeing into the quarter? Thank you. 
Tom Szkutak
I apologize, you're breaking up in part of your question, but in terms of the inventory increase up 61%, the two key drivers of that is expanding selection, as I mentioned earlier in one of the other questions. Year-over-year, we have increased our selection in our warehouses up 50% year-over-year. So certainly that is part of what you are seeing in inventories. We are also improving our in-stock levels. We're having more quantities on hand to better service customers. So those are really two aspects that you are seeing. 
Just as another note, certainly what you have seen in the past as you look at Q3 as a reminder, that we have started to bring in inventory to get ready for the holiday season. So you are seeing some of that reflected in the balance. 
Then in terms of investment, just also note that as you see the inventory rising, you're also seeing the payable balance rise substantially as well. Our days at the end of Q2 were 53 days. At the end of Q3 they were 63 days. Then it was also up year-over-year from 58 days to 63 days. 
 Imran Khan – JP Morgan 
With regards to the revenue growth acceleration guidance? I'm trying to get a sense to understand your confidence level for the Q4 guidance? 
Tom Szkutak
Sure. Again, the range that we have given for Q4 is 22% to 33%. As I had mentioned, that also includes favorable exchange of approximately 225 basis points. So that is the range that we have given. We are cautiously optimistic as we enter Q4 because of the selection that we have added which relates back to the inventory question, the in-stock improvement that we are working on as well as throughout the year, the lower prices. 
In addition, with the Amazon Prime certainly becoming more meaningful, having Amazon Prime customers certainly taking advantage of all the selection that we have, for the first time toy customers will be able to have the advantage of that during Q4 as well as Supersaver Shipping. So all of those things we think are reflected in the guidance that we have given today. 
 Imran Khan – JP Morgan 
Thank you.

Your next question comes from Mark Mahaney - Citigroup. 
 Mark Mahaney - Citigroup 
Thank you very much. Could you talk about what kind of impact we could see on margins from the rollout of Merchants@ internationally? Or maybe a way to get at that would be, could you maybe break out what percentage of units sold internationally would be third-party versus your overall average? 
Secondly, just a brief comment on the operating income guidance for the fourth quarter. While you increased your revenue guidance for the fourth quarter just slightly, but you did, lower your operating income guidance. Was there something you saw that made you more concerned about margins or less confident about margins in the December quarter? Thank you. 
Tom Szkutak
In terms of the first part of your question, in terms of Merchants@, it is difficult to predict what the ultimate third-party mix will be in each of our geographies. What we have said in the past is that certainly, as you look at our overall third-party units as a percentage of total worldwide, that we are further ahead in North America than we are in International. Certainly the launch of Merchants@ International in the countries that I have mentioned will certainly help that over time from a third-party mix standpoint. 
So again, difficult to predict exactly where that is going to end up. Ultimately the customer will decide. But we will continue to add retail selection as well as third-party selection. Again, the Merchants@ will help us do that. 
In terms of the guidance on CSOI, we actually tightened the range a little bit from what we gave you 90 days ago. The CSOI guidance for the year was 430 to 560. We tightened that during this guidance period to be 452 to 542. So we increased the lower end of the range by 22. We decreased the top end of the range by 18. So the midpoint increased slightly on the year. 
You are right. Given the fact that we exceeded the midpoint for Q3 by a little bit, you are seeing Q4 come down slightly. But again, the way that I am thinking about it is, it is a slight increase on the year with strong sequential leverage in Q4, which we feel good about. 
Mark Mahaney – Citigroup
Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from Safa Rashtchy - Piper Jaffray. 
 Safa Rashtchy - Piper Jaffray
Thank you. First, on that last point on the leverage you mentioned in Q4, how much of it is due to the normal seasonality that you always see? How much of it is because of the lower spending that you're planning to do? 
Secondly, beyond Q4, could you give us some outlook or guidance as to what factors will be impacting margins going forward? In the past you have indicated that you were continuing to spend and increase spending as a percentage of sales, especially on technology, as you had a number of initiatives. Have we reached a stability level for those? How should we look at the margins going forward? Thanks. 
Tom Szkutak
In terms of Q4, when you look at our Q3 technology and content spend, you can see that the growth rate declines versus what we have seen recently. On a percentage of revenue it actually declined versus Q2. For Q4 you should expect the growth rate will decline further, but still growing. So that is certainly one of the key drivers from a leveraged standpoint. 
The other one, certainly as you mentioned, I wouldn't view it as seasonal, but I view it as the growth rate. Certainly when you look at the range of growth that we are expecting, the growth rate is also helping us get leverage in Q4. So those are really the key drivers as it relates to Q4. 
And then in terms of going forward, we are not giving guidance, consistent with what we did last year. We're not giving guidance beyond Q4. 
You mentioned technology and content. What we have said over the last few quarters and consistent with that, we said that we will continue to grow technology and content. But with the deliberate buildup that we have had over the past years, we are going to be growing into that investment. But you should expect still that we will be growing on an absolute dollar basis. 
Keep in mind that when you think about technology and content, it is certainly the technology aspect of that; there is also a content aspect to that which is adding new selections and category expansion, which certainly we will be continuing to do over time. 
 Safa Rashtchy - Piper Jaffray

Your next question comes from Doug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers. 
 Doug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers 
Thank you. For the last several quarters, Tom, you have been talking about investing in seller platforms, digital web services and search. It seems like this quarter you dropped Search from that mix given the recent scale back in A9. So can you talk about why the change in strategy around A9 and Search? What has changed in the marketplace? Are there any cost savings involved there or perhaps how you're able to deploy the engineers working on Search? Thank you. 
Tom Szkutak
Sure. We still have a substantial investment in search. A9 was doing a few things for us; and one was product search, which we continue to invest in. We continue to learn a lot of things from our resources there. You shouldn't expect to see savings from that. We have certainly reallocated some resources to areas that we think are more beneficial to customers and shareholders over time, and that is what we're doing there. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Mark Rowen - Prudential. 
 Mark Rowen – Prudential
Thanks. Two questions. It looks like your fulfillment cost deleveraged by about 20 basis points year-over-year and that is the first time that has happened in a while. Is that because of the new facility in Europe? Do you expect that deleveraging to continue for a few quarters until you build into the capacity? 
Second in the toy business, Wal-Mart just talked about how that was one of the categories they were going to be very aggressive on and rolling back prices on certain items. Do you feel you need to beat them on price? Or is your offering more about selection and you don't have to worry too much about the limited items that they are going to have at very cheap prices? Thanks. 
Tom Szkutak
In terms of the first part of your question related to ops , certainly one piece of that is capacity. You mentioned the facility. We are operational in Leipzig, Germany, which is certainly a piece of that. Other things that are going on there, I mentioned the selection that we have been adding as well as improving in-stocks and you can see the build up in inventory. Certainly those are all factors that are also impacting our operational costs as a percentage of revenue. 
In terms of your specific questions, the second part of your question, we have a long-standing practice of not talking about any specific company. So I can't help you with that one. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Scott Devitt - Stifel Nicolaus. 
 Scott Devitt - Stifel Nicolaus
I had two questions. First, on the fulfillment center utilization, particularly in domestic you have added groceries, toys, jewelry, and third-party fulfillment services just in the past year. I'm wondering if there's going to be a need for additional capacity in terms of actual fulfillment centers over the next year? Or if you can meet the increased selection with the infrastructure you have? Then I had one follow-up. 
Tom Szkutak
Yes. In terms of any type of guidance for next year, we are not providing. We will certainly look, we learn a lot as we go through our seasonal time of the year so we'll be going through that, obviously, in the next few months. As we go through that and learn from what we see, we will certainly make our plans more specifically for next year and we can update you as we go there. 
I'm sorry; you had a second part to your question? 
 Scott Devitt - Stifel Nicolaus
Related to the lower gas prices and on the consumer-facing side of your business, have you noted any short-term increase in consumer purchasing patterns that would have been reflected in your fourth-quarter guidance? That would be the first question. 
Then on a longer term basis, even if energy prices were to stabilize at lower prices, what would it take to have the impact on your back-end logistics costs in terms of re-negotiations with the logistics providers? Thanks. 
Tom Szkutak
In terms of the first part of your question, I don't think we are a great bellwether for the economy. But certainly any of the recent trends as well as the trends that we think will happen into Q4 are reflected in our guidance. 
Operator
Your final question comes from Heath Terry - Credit Suisse. 
 Heath Terry - Credit Suisse 
You have often talked about this ultimately being a 10% operating margin business. With all of the changes in the business over the years, as well as this focus on services, is that still the case or have those expectations changed? 
On a shorter term basis, as you start building out the toy inventory and building your relationships with suppliers in that category, can you talk to us about what your experience has been and whether you have been able to get the kind of inventory commitments that you want, particularly on the hot toys for the season? 
Tom Szkutak
In terms of the first part of your question related to operating margins, the way we think about it, as a reminder, is we are actually trying to maximize free cash flow and free cash flow per share. So that is forefront what we are trying to do over the long term. So as it relates to operating margins, it is difficult to see where they will end up. 
Certainly, as we were talking about earlier as it relates to third-party mix, we are going to continue to add retail selection, we are going to continue to add third-party selection; and ultimately the customers are going to dictate what that mix will be, which will also certainly have an impact on our operating margins. 
So that is how we think about it. Where we will end up is difficult to say. But whether it is a double-digit or a high-single digit is hard to say. But certainly our goal is to maximize free cash flow and free cash flow per share. 
As it relates to toys, could you just repeat the second part of your question as it relates to toys? 
Heath Terry - Credit Suisse 
I was just saying that as you have started to build out the supplier relationships and buying inventory for this holiday season, can you talk to us about what your experience has been, particularly with regard to being able to get the type of inventory, hot toys and such that you would actually want and pricing that you would want for the business? 
Tom Szkutak
Well, we have been in the toy business for some time as a provider. We've also had, in terms of relationships, we certainly have some relationships outside of the U.S. as we have toy categories launches outside of the U.S. 
In terms of getting into specific details, I don't think it is appropriate on a vendor by vendor basis or anything like that. But we are certainly pleased with the selection we have. We have added a lot of selection in a very short period of time, over 125,000 unique items. Customers are going to benefit from that selection during Q4. Prime customers will have the benefit of getting product, toys shipped quickly to their home or office or families. We also offer Free Supersaver Shipping. Which again, those are things that will be very helpful to toy customers. We will continue to add selections over time in that category. 
Kim Nelson

Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com second quarter 2006 financial results teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Kim Nelson. Please go ahead. 
Kim Nelson
Hello and welcome to our Q2 2006 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO; Jeff Bezos, our Founder and CEO and Tom will both be available for Q&A. 
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's view as of today, July 25, 2006, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our 2005 Annual Report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. 
During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC -- each of which is posted on our IR website -- you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. 
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2005. Now I will turn the call over to Tom.

Tom Szkutak
Thanks, Kim. I will begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12-month free cash flow declined 23% to $375 million. Free cash flow is operating cash flow minus capital expenditures. The primary driver of the free cash flow decline was our increased expenditure in technology and content. Free cash flow was also reduced by a $40 million patent litigation settlement in third quarter 2005; $34 million from excess tax benefits for stock-based compensation now classified as financing cash flows; and investments in additional fulfillment capacity. 
The termination of our contract with ToysRUs.com and related fee disputes had a negative impact on trailing 12-month free cash flow of $20 million. We're working to maximize free cash flow per share over the long term. 
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 443 million shares compared with 438 million, up 1%. Stock-based awards outstanding were 24 million or 5.8% of shares outstanding, down from 26 million or 6.3% of shares outstanding. We strive to efficiently manage share count. 
Return on invested capital was 23%. ROIC is TTM-free cash flow divided by average total assets minus average current liabilities. Revenue grew 22% to $2.14 billion, or 23% excluding the $24 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. Worldwide unit growth was 25%. Third-party units representing marketplace and merchant’s units sold on Amazon sites were 29% of total units, up from 28%. 
Active customer accounts representing customers who have ordered in the past year surpassed 59 million, up 18%. Electronics and other general merchandise, or EGM, increased 37% to $624 million, or 38% excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM represents 29% of worldwide sales, up from 26%. 
Gross profit grew 13% to $509 million in Q2 and gross margin decreased 187 basis points to 24%, primarily due to the wind-down and termination of our contract with ToysRUs.com, lower product prices for customers and greater shipping loss driven by free shipping and Amazon Prime. 
Now we'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content, and G&A combined was $429 million or 20.1% of sales, up 192 basis points. Fulfillment was $182 million or 8.5% of sales, down 18 basis points. In 2006, we expect to increase our fulfillment space less than in 2005 to expand our capacity to satisfy peak demand. 
Marketing was $52 million or 2.4% of sales, up 11 basis points. Technology and content was $151 million, up 63% year-over-year or 7.1% of sales, up 177 basis points. 
We have invested in technology to innovate in areas such as seller platforms, web services and digital. Additionally, we continue to invest in increasing selection. In the last 12 months, we have increased selection of unique products carried in our warehouses by 48%. 
In addition to adding to our category leadership and buying teams for existing categories, we have added additional resources in new categories such as our grocery store at Amazon.com and our sporting goods store in Germany. You should expect we will continue to focus on selection over time. 
We're looking forward to the coming decrease in our year-over-year growth rate in technology and content spending in the second half of 2006. G&A was $44 million or 2.1% of sales, up 22 basis points. As a reminder, in 2Q05, we reported a $3 million expense reduction related to the favorable resolution of one of our previously outstanding legal matters. 
Now we will talk about our segment results. Consistent with prior periods, we don't allocate stock-based compensation or other operating expense to our segments. 
In the North America segment, revenue grew 21% to $1.16 billion, or 23% excluding the $20 million impact from ToysRUs.com. Media revenue grew 15% to $730 million, and EGM revenue grew 32% to $365 million, representing 32% of North America revenues, up from 29%. 
Gross profit grew 11% to $309 million, and gross margin decreased 224 basis points to 26.7%. 170 basis points of the 224 basis point decline was due to the termination of our ToysRUs.com contract. Other drivers were lower prices, including free shipping and Amazon Prime, as well as product mix. These effects were partially offset by increases in unit volume and the year-over-year increase in third-party sales in our mix. North America segment operating income decreased $47 million to $25 million, a 2.1% operating margin. 
In the international segment, revenue grew 24% to $982 million. Revenue growth was 27%, adjusting for the $25 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact during the quarter. Media revenue grew 17% to $718 million, or 20% excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM revenue grew 45% to $259 million, or 48% excluding FX. EGM represents 26% of international revenues, up from 22%. 
Gross profit grew 16% to $200 million or grew 19% excluding FX, while gross margin decreased 132 basis points to 20.4%. The decrease in gross margin is primarily from free shipping, price reductions and mix shift. 
International segment operating income decreased $5 million to $55 million, a 5.6% operating margin. Excluding FX, international operating income decreased 4%. The decrease in international segment operating income is primarily due to lower prices, including free shipping; and increases in operating expense, particularly technology and content. 
The combination of operating income in our North America and international segments is our consolidated segment operating income, or CSOI. Our segment information in our press release reconciles CSOI to GAAP operating income. CSOI declined 39% to $80 million. The decline in operating income was mainly due to technology and content investment, lower prices including free shipping and Amazon Prime, and $20 million from the contract termination. 
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 55% to $47 million. Our provision for income taxes was $32 million in Q2 or a 59% rate for the quarter, which includes a $4 million year-to-date adjustment to reflect our current estimate of our annual effective tax rate of 51%. 
Our effective tax rate remains higher than the 35% statutory rate primarily due to taxable income associated with the transfer of certain operating assets in connection with establishing our EU headquarters in Luxembourg. We expect these asset transfers to result in tax expense for financial reporting above the 35% statutory rate throughout 2006 and beneficially impact our effective tax rate over time. 
Since we have deferred tax assets related to our NOLs, these asset transfers will not have a significant impact on our cash taxes paid in 2006, which we expect to be approximately $25 million compared with $12 million in 2005. We are endeavoring to optimize our global taxes on a cash paid basis, not for tax expense on a financial reporting basis. 
GAAP net income was $22 million or $0.05 per diluted share compared with $52 million and $0.12 per diluted share. 
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $94 million to $1.4 billion. Inventory increased 36% to $521 million and turns decreased 6% to 14.3 as we continue to focus on availability and selection and took advantage of buying opportunities from vendors. We will continue to focus on availability and selection and to increase our mix of direct buying in existing and new product categories, enabling us to offer even lower prices to customers. 
Our investment in net fixed assets, which includes net capitalized software development costs, increased 52% from a year to $405 million. Our capital expenditures were $58 million for Q2, of which $27 million were software development costs. 
Our growth continues to be fueled by our relentless focus on the primary inputs of customer experience, convenience, selection and price. Some recent examples of our progress includes Amazon Prime. Membership in Amazon Prime more than doubled from year end. 
In Q2 '06, we also saw a strong quarter-to-quarter sequential growth for new prime memberships. We continue to see increased purchases by Amazon Prime customers across more categories, with especially heavy purchases in electronics, kitchen, and health and personal care. 
We launched our new Toy and Baby Stores on www.amazon.com featuring tens of thousands of products offered by Amazon and leading mass market and specialty retailers. This is the largest selection of toy and baby products ever offered through Amazon.com and for the first time ever, toy and baby products are eligible for Free Super Saver Shipping and Amazon Prime. 
We launched a grocery store on Amazon.com, with over 14,000 dry goods grocery products across more than 1,200 brands, all eligible for Free Super Saver Shipping and Amazon Prime. 
Our German website launched its sporting goods store, offering customers a selection of thousands of sporting goods in over 25 categories in top brands like Adidas, Burton, Nike, Puma, Quiksilver and Salomon. 
Amazon Enterprise Solutions extended its agreement with Target.com through August 2010 and launched a new Sears Canada-branded website, providing Sears Canada with the tools and services to control its brand, merchandising and online business using Amazon Enterprise Solutions technology. 
Amazon S3, a simple storage service for software developers, gained momentum in its first full quarter after launch, providing businesses of all sizes, from Microsoft to SmugMug, with a web services solution for storing and retrieving any amount of data at any time from anywhere on the Web. Developers continue to adopt Amazon's web services. Over 180,000 have registered to date, up greater than 60% year-over-year. 
Third-party sellers remain a key part of our selection expansion, and worldwide active seller accounts, merchants with an order from a customer during the preceding 12 months, exceeded 1.08 million, up 10% year-over-year. Some pricing highlights include the average customer discount across books, music and video products purchased on www.amazon.com increased more than 250 basis points year-over-year. 
Amazon.co.jp increased its customer discount on pre-order new-release DVDs up to 25%. Over the past 12 months, customers have saved over $0.5 billion on shipping through our worldwide free shipping offers and Amazon Prime. 
I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to date and what we believe to date to be appropriately conservative assumptions. However, there is a high level of uncertainty surrounding fluctuation in the euro, pound, yen, Canadian dollar and won exchange rates, as well as the global economy and consumer spending and the impact on both of world events. While we are cautiously optimistic, it is not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
Let me also remind everyone that we mark our euro-denominated debt to market at the end of each quarter, which results in a gain or loss for any movement in the euro between reporting dates. We also have euro exposure related to our interest expense on this euro-denominated debt. We incur a foreign currency gain or loss corresponding with inter-Company balances denominated in foreign currencies, which are settled among subsidiaries. 
Depending on the amount and timing, an unfavorable resolution of outstanding legal matters could materially affect our business, results of operations, financial position or cash flows in a particular period. 
Our effective tax rate in 2006 is subject to significant variation based on changes in our corporate structure and business operations, the amount of expenses incurred that are permanently non-deductible for U.S. tax purposes, such as stock-based compensation paid to foreign employees, the tax characterization of income earned, changes in current tax laws and changes in estimates, including accurately predicting our taxable income in the taxable jurisdictions to which it relates. 
Our guidance assumes that we won't record any additional intangible assets or any further revisions to stock-based compensation or our restructuring-related estimates and that FX rates remain approximately where they have been recently. 
For Q3, we expect net sales of between $2.17 billion and $2.33 billion, a growth of between 17% and 25%. GAAP operating income to be between $7 million and $42 million or between 87% decline and a 24% decline. This includes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets of approximately $38 million. 
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $45 million and $80 million or between a 63% decline and a 34% decline. 
For calendar 2006, we expect net sales of between $10.15 billion and $10.65 billion, a growth of between 20% and 25%. This guidance anticipates a small negative impact from foreign exchange. 
GAAP operating income to be between $310 million and $440 million or between a 28% decline and 2% growth. This includes approximately $120 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. 
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $430 million and $560 million or a 24% decline and 1% decline. 
As you can see from our Q3 and total year guidance, we expect operating leverage will show significant improvement in the fourth quarter. 
We expect our 2006 free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to our operating profit growth rate year-over-year. This excludes the impact of FAS 123 R, which could be up to $100 million of excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation being classified as positive financing cash flows instead of operating cash flows, up from $7 million in 2005. 
We expect capital expenditures, including capitalized software development costs, to be approximately $225 million. 
We will continue to strive for year-over-year annual growth in free cash flow and free cash flow per share while investing in our long-term opportunities. We're confident that if we continue to improve customer experience and execute efficiently, our value proposition as well as our free cash flow, will further expand. 
Thanks, and with that, Kim, let's move to questions. 
Kim Nelson
Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call with Jeff and Tom. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to ask a question? 
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank Securities. 
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank Securities
A couple of questions. If you take the midpoint of the CSOI range from the last quarter to this quarter and adjust for the Toys 'R' Us impact of $50 million, it gets to about a $35 million swing, from $580 million to $545 million. 
Can you just reconcile, is that all the toy category build out and scaling up in that category, or is there something else that is really driving that? 
Second, you talked about web services, about 180,000 developers. When do you think you start to meaningfully monetize those 180,000 developers and the initiatives that they're up to, to built out their own services around the Amazon ecosystem? 
Tom Szkutak
In terms of the guidance question, you are right. We increased the revenue guidance to $10.15 billion to $10.65 billion. In the bottom, we gave a range for CSOI of $430 million to $560 million which again, on the bottom end of that range is down $85 million from last time. 
The reason why it is down from last time is because of the heavy investment in toys, which certainly includes the termination of the contract, as well as being more aggressive on prices in all of our categories. So that's really the delta on the bottom line. 
In terms of web services, we are very excited about what we see so far. It is still very, very early for us. We think certainly from a return perspective, certainly we're looking at it over the long term, but we are extremely encouraged from what we see so far. 
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank Securities
You provide the base level infrastructure in the web services area. Are you also looking at the SKUs and the product detail pages that you have on the platform as the monetization engine for these developers? Or is there another monetization engine to help them subsidize or generate revenues off of their initiatives? 
Tom Szkutak
Well, for part of our web services, it is exactly as you say. But then there are web services like Amazon S3, the simple storage service, that has gotten traction that has vastly exceeded our expectations and continues to grow. So we are super-excited about that. That is a completely different model, where we monetize it by literally charging for the web service directly. 
Then the developers who use those services will monetize them and do monetize them by charging subscription fees to their own on-demand applications. 
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank Securities
Thank you. 
Operator
Our next question comes from Anthony Noto - Goldman Sachs. 
Anthony Noto - Goldman Sachs
Thank you very much. Jeff, I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on Amazon's long-term vision and how you would qualify the way you think you can differentiate the brand going forward? I mean, there's a lot we read about in the papers, and obviously there's a lot of initiatives that have happened in the last quarter. I just wonder if we could revisit that as we have seen you announce, obviously, groceries. There's a lot of talk around a lot of other things as it relates to the media categories and digital strategy. On your site, there's a lot of new videos and other entertainment types of contents as opposed to pure product sales. 
Tom, my question is you guys have talked about maximizing free cash flow dollars. I definitely understand the impact from Toys 'R' Us on your lower operating income for the fourth quarter. I don't necessarily see the benefit from lowering prices further, because it results in a pretty significant pickup in revenue. 25% revenue growth is an acceleration, that's really a positive. But it looks like it is coming at the cost of operating income, and therefore free cash flow relative to what you would have thought excluding Toys 'R' Us. I was wondering if you could comment on that. Thanks. 
Jeff Bezos
Sure. Our strategy for our business is a three-fold with respect to finding the elements that matter to customers that are durable in time where we can build flywheels that we can continue to put energy into. 
The three big flywheels are selection, price and availability. So if you look at each of those, we know that 10 years from now, customers will still care about selection. We know they will still care about availability and price. They'll want to get their products quickly. So the energy that we put into building those flywheels today will continue to pay dividends, even ten years from now. 
So the price one is very straightforward. The more scale we have, the better our cost structure, both on the variable side with COGS and because we get to leverage our fixed expense as well. So there, we will have the ability to offer lower prices and that makes the Company scale increase, which again allows us to keep spinning that flywheel and further drive down costs and prices and so on. 
With availability, you will see a similar flywheel. As you have a distributed node fulfillment center network, you get to put products closer to customers. That makes it possible to economically do outbound transportation for things like Amazon Prime. So the fact that we have a big multi-node network and that we have the volume to economically support a multi-node network puts us in a very unique and differentiated position to offer a membership program like Amazon Prime to economically afford to do things like Free Super Saver Shipping. So availability is another one. 
Then selection has a similar thing. You see that the number of in-stock ASINs that we have under our own roof is up very dramatically year-over-year, more than 40%. Again, in order to be able to do that, you need a certain amount of volume because when you look at those low-turn ASINs in the tail, you need to have enough volume that you can afford to carry even those slow-moving ASINs and make them available to customers on a very rapid basis. 
The third-party strategy also plays into that selection point, where the more customer volume we have, the more flow we have, the more active customers, the more third-party sellers want to interact with that customer flow. 
Tom Szkutak
I think Jeff answered a good portion of the second part of your question, Anthony, with his answer as well, in terms of the pricing strategy. But you're absolutely right, pricing in the short term is expensive, but it has the benefits that Jeff described as he talked about the flywheel as it relates to pricing. It gives us the ability over the long term to have a bigger scale, to get better COGS reductions. It has the ability to leverage our fixed cost structure better as well. 
So as you think about our guidance and the pricing piece specifically, that is exactly how we're thinking about it. In addition to that, the way you should think about it is it's existing categories plus new categories. As we launch these new categories, we want to make sure that we get the scale quickly to get some of the benefits that Jeff described. So that is what we intend on doing and that is the rationale. 
Anthony Noto - Goldman Sachs
Tom, do you think the forecasted acceleration in revenue growth to 25% year-over-year, which is faster than this quarter and the third quarter, and a seasonally stronger growth rate of 65% compared to last year at 60%, is completely due to the lower prices or is it also due to groceries and other categories you may not have announced yet? 
Tom Szkutak
It is due to a number of things that we talked about. We are investing heavily in the toy category for the second half, some of the new categories we have launched. We are expanding selection in the existing categories. We're putting more selection under our own roof, which we also think is helpful, as well as the pricing. 
But in terms of what I was describing with the impact on the bottom line, and those are the elements, but certainly on the top-line perspective, it is pricing, additional selection and new categories. 
Anthony Noto - Goldman Sachs
Thank you. 
Operator
Our next question comes from Mark Rowen - Prudential. 
Mark Rowen - Prudential
Thanks. When you do your own toys, is that going to cause your gross margin to drop significantly in the back half of the year from where it was, given that your third-party gross margins were probably higher? 
Jeff Bezos
Yes, we haven't broken out the full financials on our relationship with TRU, or we don't give guidance on any specific category. As we look forward, we certainly have reflected what we think will happen in the toys category in the guidance that we have given for both Q3 and the total year. 
Mark Rowen - Prudential
Well, I guess the reason I'm asking is with the lower reported operating margin that you guided to, is that primarily a function of gross margin or higher expenses? 
Jeff Bezos
Yes, it is, again, it incorporates all of the factors that we have seen to date and what we expect for the second half. But the investment specifically in toys, as we talk about it, is a number of different things. 
It is certainly an investment in the people to run that category. It is an investment in the selection, which we have built up very quickly to launch in early July, and we'll continue to add to that selection over time. It is an investment in the fact that we're offering today free shipping, Super Saving Shipping, as well as free shipping through Amazon Prime. So that's certainly a significant investment, as well as we want to make sure that we have very competitive pricing as we launch this new category for us on our detail pages. So it is a combination of all of those. That is what is reflected in both our Q3 and total year guidance. 
Mark Rowen - Prudential
Do you think in the toy category that you'll be able to sell as many toy units as Toys 'R' Us did? Or is it going to take time to build up the customer awareness? In other words, did the Toys 'R' Us brand attract a certain number of those customers and unit sales? 
Jeff Bezos
You know, we are not giving unit guidance on the toy category. But I would say that we are optimistic. We think we are going to offer an incredible experience to customers. We think this is, over the long term, is very good for customers and for shareholders. We are excited about the experience that we can give, not only with the selection, but with the service, particularly with Prime and Super Saver Shipping. So we think the total package is going to be great for customers and shareholders long term. We think customers are going to like it short term. We think it is going to be expensive short term. 
Mark Rowen - Prudential
Thanks. 
Operator
Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers. 
Doug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers
Thank you. I just wanted to get some more detail on your free cash flow, and specifically the $13 million that you essentially withheld from Toys 'R' Us during the quarter. I just wanted to get clarity on how that is being booked in your cash flow statement, and then also just clarify that we're not really seeing that in the income statement. Also, why did you see no real benefit in terms of accounts payable during the quarter? Thank you. 
Tom Szkutak
Sure. First of all, this is active litigation in terms of Toys 'R' Us. But from an accounting standpoint, we did withhold the $13 million, so it is reflected positively in our free cash flow and operating cash flows. From an accounting standpoint, there's $20 million of revenue that we did not recognize during the quarter that has also an impact of $20 million on CSOI. So it's $20 million of revenue in CSOI that we did not recognize. 
I'm not sure if I understand the payables question. Our payable days were 53 days for the quarter. That is up from 51 days last year. So it is an improvement of two days year-over-year. 
Doug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers
With the change in accounts payable, is that a positive benefit of $4 million during the quarter? Just looking back historically, you have always obviously had a much bigger benefit in the second quarter. 
Tom Szkutak
What you are probably looking at is, and you can see it in some of the timing, the two-day improvement year-over-year actually was very solid compared to most of the quarters over the past several quarters. If you look at Q1 year-over-year, it was actually a little bit better improvement, which is closer to four days, which was probably the best we have had in several quarters. 
So again, it was still a very good improvement and year-over-year, 53 versus 51 days. It also improved sequentially from 48 to 53 days. So again, it was I think a solid improvement year-over-year. 
Doug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers
Thank you. 
Operator
Our next question comes from Justin Post - Merrill Lynch. 
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch
Thank you. I noticed that the shipping costs went up from 21% growth last quarter to 27% growth this quarter. I am assuming that's for Amazon Prime. Can you talk a little bit about the benefits of Amazon Prime? What do those customers give you that the non-Prime customers don’t give you? Why are you still keeping with the program? Are you still positive on it? 
Secondly, on the media items, more and more media seems to be going digital. Can you talk about any thoughts you have on the margin outlook for media sales as they become digital and if you think there will be any changes to Amazon's margin structure if you bring more digital items to consumers? 
Jeff Bezos
The reason that we like Amazon Prime -- yes, we're still very positive on it. In fact, we are more positive on it than we ever have been as we see the adoption. It's because we see a lift in sales when people, their kind of pre- and post-behavior after they become Amazon Prime members. The experience that we are giving to the customer is improved because they're getting their products very rapidly. So they get more instant gratification. While they still free shipping, they get two-day delivery; whereas before, they could get free shipping, and they did often get free shipping, but it was with our Super Saver Shipping, which isn't a two-day delivery. 
So really, that is the thing that we like about it. There are several things, but the big one is we see an increase in sales from those Amazon Prime members, and it deepens our relationship with those customers. They shop in more categories with us. It is a program that would be very hard for most companies to pursue. It requires that you be a multi-category retailer to do it, in an effective way. It requires that you have excellent transportation costs. It requires a certain amount of scale so that you can have a multi-node network. 
So it is differentiated. It is something that customers love. It is durable in time. It creates an uplift in sales. So while this is certainly an expensive investment, it really does build what will be a more important and bigger company over the long term. 
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch
Then on the digital distribution of maybe music and video, how do you see that affecting margins over the long term? 
Tom Szkutak
It's very early and certainly difficult to predict what will happen over time. So certainly it is something that we are staying very close to. But it is difficult to estimate what that impact will be over time. 
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch
Thank you. 
Operator
Our next question comes from Imran Khan - JP Morgan. 
Imran Khan - JP Morgan
Good afternoon, Jeff and Tom. Two questions. First, if I look at your midpoint of your guidance in Q3 and Q4, it seems like you are expecting significant margin expansion in Q4 from Q3 levels. I'm trying to understand what gives you that confidence, considering you are getting into some of the businesses that have lower gross margins like grocery and maybe toy. 
Clearly, you're investing a lot of dollars in the technology area. Investors or the analysts like us, we are outside. How can I keep track of your progress? How can I keep track of this scorecard that we'll really see some sort of return on investment of those investments? 
Tom Szkutak
Sure. First of all, on the guidance question, if you look at Q3, I just want to remind you, as you look at the top line guidance, that in Q3 we are overlapping Harry Potter 6. As we had mentioned last year during our call for Q3, that the impact of Harry Potter 6 on our overall top line was approximately 260 basis points. So we are overlapping that, because you're looking at the growth rates in Q3 and Q4, keep that in mind. 
As you are looking at the bottom line, beyond the factors that I have already described in our guidance, keep in mind that in Q4 of last year or throughout last year, we have built up our spend in technology and content. In Q4 specifically, we're overlapping that spend. As we mentioned, we expect that our technology and content growth rate is going to decline in the second half versus first half. So that is what is impacting Q4 most predominately. 
In terms of the other question related to technology and content, how you measure our progress in terms of output, I think that that's something that you will have to wait and see as we launch new products and services over time. 
Imran Khan - JP Morgan
Great, thanks. 
Operator
Our next question comes from Safa Rashtchy - Piper Jaffray. 
Paul Beaver - Piper Jaffray
This is Paul Beaver for Safa. I was just wondering if you are seeing any pressure from gas prices or a slowing economy? Similarly, will you be able to get incremental leverage from your vendors in this slowing economy? 
Tom Szkutak
I will take the second part of your question. I think certainly our leverage with suppliers will certainly be most prominent as we continue to grow. That's an up and down economy. As we get further scale in our individual categories it just helps our overall COGS. It also helps leverage our fixed cost structure. So again, that's where you'll see it both in up and down economies. 
In terms of gas prices -- I am assuming that is on demand -- with the growth rates that we have, I don't think that we are necessarily a great bellwether for the economy. So it is hard to say, but again, I think that's all I have to say on that particular question. 
Paul Beaver - Piper Jaffray
A quick follow-up. What is your strategy with the grocery segment? It seems like a fairly low-margin category to pursue. Can you just provide some color for us? 
Jeff Bezos
Well, the way we are doing this category is very different from the way it has been done in the past. The quantity sizes tend toward stock-up quantity sizes, which gets the ASP of the item higher. We are accustomed to operating with relatively low ASP items. When you look at the amount of gross profit dollars in an item that we handle profitably at Amazon.com, it can be very low. That is a capability that we have built up over time. 
So we are selecting the items that go into that store to be items that we think over time can build a profitable business for us. The consumer reaction in these early days to that offering has been extremely positive, in large part because the selection of that offering is already so strong, and it will just get better from here. So we don't just carry a few flavors of Jello; we carry all 80. 
Paul Beaver - Piper Jaffray
Thank you. 
Operator
Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney - Citigroup. 
Mark Mahaney - Citigroup
A question for Jeff. Jeff, when you talked about the three flywheels -- selection, price and availability -- I'm wondering if you think about the digital media offerings that are out there in the market now, do you sense that one of those flywheels or two of those flywheels aren't there in strength? Where would be the weakness of those three flywheels amongst the existing digital media offerings that are out in the marketplace? Thank you. 
Jeff Bezos
Sure. Digital will have its own set of flywheels, and we are not prepared to talk about that at this time. 
Operator
Our next question comes from Robert Peck - Bear Stearns. 
Robert Peck - Bear Stearns
Quick questions around the changing environment around you. First of all, with the eBay fee increase impending, could you talk a little bit about any additional inquiries you've gotten from third-party sellers and how you think that could impact you going into third or fourth quarter? 
Secondly, could you also address the rollout of eBay Express really starting in September/October and how you think that could impact business going forward and maybe some of your advantages? 
Lastly, with Google Checkout, could you talk a little bit about any impacts that you could see from that? Is there any sort of patent violation there as far as one-click checkout? Any comments around those three products would be great. Thanks. 
Jeff Bezos
I would just say that as a long-standing practice, we don't talk about other companies. We will certainly stick with that. The retail business and the fixed-price business is one that has always had a tremendous amount of competition. These are very large markets. There is room for thousands of winners. We are customer focused and will stay that way. That doesn't mean we don't pay attention to what competitors do; we do. We watch and we try to learn. But these are big markets and there's plenty of room. 
Operator
Our last question comes from Heath Terry - Credit Suisse. 
Heath Terry - Credit Suisse
Great. I was wondering if you could just give us an update on the Marks & Spencer relationship in Europe? Where are you guys in the process of actually getting that into production? Also, in your international business, how should we be thinking about new product rollouts there as your international product offerings continue to lag what we're seeing here in the U.S.? 
Jeff Bezos
Sure. I will take the second part first. In terms of our international business, we think there's still a lot of opportunity to grow and add new selection and new product categories. We've seen some of those launches recently, certainly with sports, as we mentioned on the opening comments. 
So again, we are very excited about the opportunity we have in international. We think there's a lot of selection and new categories to go into. We think there is, over time, certainly geographical expansion in addition to what we have done to date that are high. 
In terms of Marks & Spencer, as we have mentioned previously, we will be launching their website in the second half of this year. 
Kim Nelson
Thanks Heath, and thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our investor relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

Tom Szkutak
Thanks, Kim. This was another successful quarter for Amazon.com. I will start with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12-month free cash flow grew 20% to $501 million. Free cash flow is operating cash flow minus capital expenditures. Trailing 12-month free cash flow includes a one-time payment of $40 million in connection with the patent lawsuit settlement in Q305 and excludes $13 million of tax benefits from stock-based compensation that are classified as positive financing cash flows under FAS 123R. Adjusting for these two items, TTM free cash flow grew 32% to $554 million. 
As a reminder, the financial measure we're working to maximize over the long-term is free cash flow per share. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 438 million shares compared with 434 million, up 1%. Stock-based awards outstanding were 21 million or 4.9% of shares outstanding, down from 24 million or 5.7% of shares outstanding. We strive to efficiently manage share count. 
Return on invested capital was 32%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus average current liabilities. 
Revenue grew 20% to $2.28 billion or 25%, excluding the $94 million unfavorable impact in year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. Worldwide unit growth was 24%. 
Third-party units representing marketplace and merchant's units sold on Amazon sites were 29% of total units, up from 27%. Active customer accounts, representing customers who have ordered in the past year, surpassed 57 million, up 19%. 
Electronics and other general merchandise, or EGM, increased 33% to $639 million or 38% excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM represents 28% of worldwide sales, up from 25%. Gross profit grew 19% to $547 million in Q1, and gross margin decreased 9 basis points to 24%, primarily due to greater shipping loss driven by free shipping in Amazon Prime and our lower product prices. These decreases were partially offset by increased third-party sales. 
Now I will discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation expense under FAS 123R which we early adopted in Q105. Fulfillment, marketing, technical content and G&A combined was $427 million or 18.8% of sales, up 141 basis points. Fulfillment was $190 million or 8.3% of sales, down 24 basis points. 
In 2006 we expect to increase our fulfillment space less than in 2005 to extend our capacity to satisfy peak demand. For example, we are opening a new fulfillment center in Leipzig, Germany which we expect will be operational by Q3 this year. 
Marketing was $54 million or 2.4% of sales, up 11 basis points. Technology and content increased 69% year-over-year to $138 million, and we expect this percentage to decrease substantially in the back half of this year. Q106 represents 6.1% of sales, up 177 basis points. G&A was $45 million or 0.2% of sales, down 24 basis points. As a reminder in Q105, we recorded an $8 million charge related to litigation matters. 
Now I will talk about our segment results. Consistent with prior periods, we don't allocate stock-based compensation or other operating expense to our segments. In the North American segment, revenue grew 21% to $1.25 billion. Media revenue grew 17% to $815 million, and EGM revenue grew 33% to $374 million, representing 30% of North America revenues, up from 27%. Apparel, jewelry and sporting goods revenue all more than doubled year-over-year. 
Gross profit grew 22% to $341 million, and gross margin increased 18 basis points to 27.3%, largely due to third-party sales, as well as an $11 million increase in other revenue primarily driven by Amazon Enterprise Solutions; partially offset by Amazon Prime, our price reductions across product categories, product mix shift and free shipping. 
North America segment operating income decreased $4 million to $62 million, a 5% operating margin. In the International segment, revenue grew 18% to $1.03 billion. Revenue growth accelerated to 29%, adjusting for the $96 million year-over-year unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates during the quarter. 
Media revenue grew 13% to $763 million or 24%, excluding FX, the highest growth rate since Q4 of 2004. EGM revenue grew 33% to $265 million, or 45% excluding FX, representing 26% of international revenues, up from 23%. Gross profit grew 15% to $206 million or 26% excluding FX, while gross margin decreased 53 basis points to 20% primarily from free shipping, product price reductions and a mix shift. 
International segment operating income decreased $4 million to $58 million, a 5.6% operating margin. Excluding FX, international operating income increased 6%. The combination of operating income in North America and International segment is our consolidated segment operating income, or CSOI. Our segment information and our press release reconciles CSOI to GAAP operating income. 
CSOI declined 7% to $120 million or flat year-over-year, excluding the $8 million unfavorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange rates. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 2% to $106 million. Excluding the $8 million impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates, operating income increased 6% to $114 million. 
Our provision for income taxes was $45 million in Q1, or a 47% rate for the quarter, reflecting our current estimate of our annual effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate remains higher than the 35% statutory rate, primarily due to taxable income associated with the transfer of certain operating assets in connection with establishing our EU headquarters in Luxembourg. 
We expect these asset transfers to result in tax expense for the financial reporting year above the 35% statutory rate throughout 2006 and beneficially impacting our effective tax rate over time. Since we have deferred tax assets related to our NOLs, these asset transfers will not have a significant impact on our cash taxes paid in 2006, which we expect to be approximately $25 million compared with $12 million in 2005. We are endeavoring to optimize our global taxes on a cash paid basis, not for tax expense on a financial reporting basis. 
GAAP net income was $51 million or $0.12 per diluted share compared with $78 million and $0.18 per diluted share. Q105 includes a $26 million or $0.06 per diluted share gain for the accumulative effect of a change in accounting principles related to the adoption of FAS 123R. 
Turning to the balance sheet, cash from marketable securities increased $184 million to $1.3 billion. In Q106 we redeemed EUR 250 million or $300 million in principal amount of our 6 7/8. This redemption mitigates potential dilution of over 2.9 million shares and reduces our annual cash interest expense by approximately $21 million. 
Inventory increased 33% to $538 million, and turns decreased 7% to 14.4 as we expanded the breadth of our product category selections and our fulfillment centers and took advantage of buying opportunities from vendors. We will continue to increase our mix of direct buying in existing and new product categories, enabling us to offer even lower prices to customers. 
Our investment in net fixed assets, which includes net capitalized software development costs, increased 47% from a year ago to $361 million. Our capital expenditures were $46 million for Q1. $26 million of CapEx was software development costs. 
Our growth continues to be fueled by our relentless focus on the primary input to customer experience: convenience, selection and price. Some recent examples of our progress include Amazon Prime. We're pleased to see strong quarter to quarter sequential growth for new Amazon Prime subscriptions. We continue to see increased purchases by Amazon Prime customers across more categories, with especially heavy use in electronics, kitchen and health and personal care. For $79 a year, Amazon Prime members get all-you-can-eat, free two-day shipment. 
We introduced 'click to call', a new feature for our US, UK, German and French websites which allows customers to be connected quickly with a customer service representative who will often already have the customer's account information in front of them, saving the customer time and increasing satisfaction. 
Amazon's Japanese website introduced several new payment methods which allow customers to pay for their Amazon.co.jp purchases with online banking at approximately 70,000 convenience stores and ATMs throughout Japan. 
Amazon's German and UK websites launched wedding registries enabling couples to choose gifts from millions of products for their household, including kitchen and home appliances, cookware, cutlery, electronics and more. 
Amazon Web Services launched Amazon S3, a simple storage service for software developers. S3 provides an application programming interface for highly scalable, reliable, low latency data storage at very low cost. Developers continue to adopt Web Services. Over 160,000 have registered to date, upgraded to 60% year-over-year. 
Amazon's German website, Amazon.de, introduced the Advantage program. This enables increased selection and 24-hour availability for customers by allowing vendors to store their products on consignment in Amazon's fulfillment center. 
We acquired ShopBop.com, a retailer of fashion forward apparel, shoes and accessories for women, featuring products from more than 75 leading designers including Marc Jacobs, Juicy Couture and True Religion. Third-party sellers remained a key part of our selection expansion in worldwide active seller accounts, merchants with an order from a customer during the preceding 12 months exceeded 1.08 million, up 15% year-over-year. 
Amazon Enterprise Solutions announced two new partners -- Benefit Cosmetics, a subsidiary of luxury group LVMH, and Timex. 
Some pricing highlights include the average customer discounts across books, music and video products purchased on www.Amazon.com increased more than 150 basis points year-over-year. Customers have enjoyed our '4 for 3' offer in books on Amazon.com. Order four books under $10 and pay for only three. Over the past 12 months, customers have saved approximately $0.5 billion on shipping throughout our worldwide free shipping offers and Amazon Prime. 
I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to date and what we believe to date to be appropriately conservative assumptions. However, there is a high level of uncertainty surrounding fluctuations in the euro pound, yen, Canadian dollar and Yuan exchange rates, as well as the global economy and consumer spending and the impact on both of world events. 
While we are cautiously optimistic, it is not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
Let me also remind everyone that we mark our euro-denominated debt to market at the end of each quarter, which results in a gain or loss for any movement in the euro between reporting dates. We also have zero exposure related to our interest expense and on this euro-denominated debt. We incur a foreign currency gain or loss corresponding with the inter-company balances denominated in foreign currencies which are settled amongst subsidiaries. 
Depending on the amount and timing, an unfavorable resolution of outstanding legal matters could materially affect our business, results of operations, the income position or cash flows in a particular period. 
Our effective tax rate in 2006 is subject to significant variations based on changes in our corporate structure and business operations, the amount of expenses incurred that are permanently non-deductible for U.S. tax purposes such as stock-based compensation paid to foreign employees, the tax characterization of income earned and changes in current tax laws and estimates, including the variability in predicting our taxable income and the taxable jurisdictions to which it relates. 
Our guidance assumes that we don't record any additional intangible assets or any further revisions to stock-based compensation or restructuring-related estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently. 
We are appealing a recent court decision that terminates our ToysRUs.com contract, and we are seeking a stay of the termination pending a decision on our appeal. While we believe we will prevail and that ToysRUs.com's claims lack merit, the timing and possible outcomes of this litigation are uncertain, and possible effects of termination are not reflected in the following guidance. If we do not prevail, operating profit could be negatively impacted by as much as $50 million for the year, including as much as $25 million for the second quarter. 
For Q2 we expect net sales of between $2.03 billion and $2.18 billion or growth of between 16% to 24%. This guidance anticipates greater than $50 million or over 280 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange due to the dollar's continued strength. 
GAAP operating income to be between $32 million and $67 million or between a 69% decline and a 36% decline. This includes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets of approximately $38 million. 
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which includes a negative impact from foreign exchange and excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $70 million and $105 million or between 47% decline and 20% decline. 
For calendar year 2006, we expect net sales of between $9.95 billion and $10.5 billion or growth of between 17% and 24%. This guidance anticipates approximately $150 million or over 175 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange. 
GAAP operating income to be between $390 million and $520 million or between a 10% decline and 20% growth. This includes approximately $125 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. 
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which includes a negative impact for foreign exchange and excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $515 million and $645 million or a 9% decline and 14% growth. 
Operating leverage to improve in the second half of the year compared with the first half of the year. We expect our 2006 free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to our operating profit growth rate year-over-year. This excludes the impact of FAS 123R which should be less than $100 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation being classified as positive financing cash flows instead of operating cash flows, up from $7 million in 2005. 
We expect capital expenditures, including capitalized software development costs, to be approximately $225 million. 
We will continue to strive for year-over-year annual growth and free cash flow and free cash flow per share while investing in our long-term opportunities. We are confident that if we continue to improve customer experience and execute efficiently, our value proposition, as well as our free cash flow, will further expand. Thanks and with that, let's move to questions. 
Kim Nelson
Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call with Jeff and Tom. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to ask a question? 
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Mark Mahaney, Citigroup. 
Mark Mahaney - Citigroup
Thank you very much. Two questions, please. First, on the Toys ""R"" Us, is it your expectation that you will get some sort of decision in the June quarter? Is why you think -- is that why you're sizing that at $25 million? Or is it very uncertain at what point in the balance of the year you'll reach a decision? 
Secondly, could you talk about any trends in your technology and content spending? Are you spending in areas that are different than you have been spending over the last, say, two quarters and just in that second content area? 
Tom Szkutak
 Sure. I will take the second part of your question first. In terms of technology and content, no -- we're spending in the same areas that we have been talking about consistently, and we are making investments in customer experience, digital, web services, search, improving the seller platform and other productivity initiatives. So that is the same. 
In terms of Toys ""R"" Us, certainly this ongoing litigation, to try and predict when that is going to resolve; I think it is uncertain and difficult to say. 
Operator
Our next question comes from Anthony Noto, Goldman Sachs. 
 Anthony Noto - Goldman Sachs
Thank you very much. Tom, I wonder if you can elaborate a little bit, your second quarter guidance for consolidated operating income implies at the midpoint about a 4% operating margin, which is obviously down year-over-year and also relative to the first quarter. So it seems like there will be a more significant ramp in the second quarter in spending. Then it requires a pretty meaningful expansion in the back half of the year to about 6.3%. 
I was just trying to understand what products are you investing in in the first half of this year that we will see, from a consumer facing standpoint, that could potentially drive that acceleration of revenue in the back half of the year and that margin expansion? It is really hard to have the visibility without knowing those products. Thank you. 
Tom Szkutak
 Sure. Just to maybe talk a little bit about Q2 in the second half. In terms of Q2, what you're seeing is Q2 historically is our lowest seasonal quarter from a revenue standpoint. We certainly have lowered prices considerably, which is certainly impacting the bottom line guidance for Q2. 
We also have, as I mentioned in the opening remarks, higher fixed costs in the first half, and that growth rate will be going down in the second half. So in other words the growth rate in the second half of '06 will be lower versus the second half of 2005. 
So in terms of the growth in terms of individual products and any new launches, we have not in the past announced any new categories before the launch. But certainly with the growth that you're seeing in Q1, we saw accelerated growth from 22% in Q4 to 24.8%. So we saw some nice accelerated growth and we like what we see. We're going to continue to focus on those inputs that helped drive Q1, throughout the year. So that is why you're seeing the better leverage in the second half as well as the updated guidance that we gave for the total year as well. 
Operator
Our next question comes from Safa Rashtchy, Piper Jaffray. 
Safa Rashtchy - Piper Jaffray
My question again relates to Toys ""R"" Us. Given that you lost the current or last ruling, could you give us some idea as to why you are confident that you would win? Why would it make sense not to include revenues or profits from Toys ""R"" Us and kind of wait to see how the ruling would be? 
Tom Szkutak
Sure. Again, beyond the filings that we have made to date, we have a practice of not talking about ongoing litigation. I wanted to provide some data in the opening remarks to give some context of how we are thinking about it. I think certainly that is appropriate. But beyond that, I don't have a lot to say on Toys ""R"" Us. 
Operator
Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth, Lehman Brothers. 
Doug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers
I just have two quick questions. One actually does relate to Toys ""R"" Us. But I'm just trying to figure out why in 2Q you get so much of the impact there, of the $25 million potentially? So that is question number one. 
The second one is your hiring, I noticed that it was only about an incremental 400 people in terms of head count in 1Q, which is a pretty dramatic slowdown -- at least on an absolute basis -- from what we saw throughout each quarter in 2005. Is that a pretty fair way to think about your head count growth going forward? 
Tom Szkutak
 Yes. In terms of Toys ""R"" Us, there is certainly a range of possible outcomes. So the Q2 impact and the total year, we are trying to give what we think is an appropriately conservative look at the situation there as we know it today. So that is how we are thinking about TRU. 
In terms of the hiring, we are still continuing to hire. As you mentioned, you did see a sequential growth of 400 from year end to the end of Q1, which is lighter than we have seen in the past. As we had mentioned in the previous call, we made a deliberate decision in 2005 to increase head count specifically in technology areas. We hired a lot of software development engineers and computer scientists. You will see that over the next few years, we want to grow into that investment base. So that is really what you're seeing. So that I think answers your question. 
Operator
Our next question comes from Imran Khan, JP Morgan. 
Imran Khan - JP Morgan
Thank you. Good afternoon, Tom and Jeff. Actually two questions, one going back to Anthony's question. If I look at the back half of your guidance, it seems like you're expecting 66% or so -- if I take a mid-point operating profit -- coming in the second half of this year. That is not reflective of the 50% to 55% we saw in the last two years. 
You talked a little bit about fixed costs will be basically first half. I was trying to get a sense, if you can talk about the quarter from those fixed costs? In terms of the technology spending, it grew 68% year-over-year. How should we think about going to Q2, Q3, Q4? How do you see the technological spending flowing, that will help them? 
Tom Szkutak
 Sure. The technology and content, the 69% excluding stock-based comp growth, you should see a substantial growth reduction in the second half of the year versus the second half of 2005. Then the fixed cost piece, could you just repeat that part of the question? 
Imran Khan - JP Morgan
So I was wondering if you could give us some sense, what are some of those fixed costs that you have in first half but you don't have in second half? 
Tom Szkutak
 Sure. Part of it is just the build-up that you saw in the latter half of last year. So if you look at the operating expense over the course of last year, we have had a sizable build-up through the course of last year with Q4 being certainly the highest. You will be starting to see the lapping of that increase in the second half of the year. 
Imran Khan - JP Morgan
Okay. If I may ask one follow-up question in terms of Amazon Prime. You said that you have had pretty good success with Amazon Prime. I was wondering if you could give us some color like how many customers are using Amazon Prime right now and what kind of ASP improvement you saw because of Amazon Prime? Some maybe ballpark color, I would appreciate that. 
Jeff Bezos
We're not providing any numbers on Amazon Prime. What I can tell you is that we have seen very exciting growth sequentially Q4 to Q1, even though we came off a very strong Q4 for Amazon Prime. New subscriptions are up even sequentially off of our seasonally heavy quarter. So we continue to and we are able to track a bunch of numbers with Amazon Prime in terms of what it does to wallet share and increased spending, those kinds of metrics, renewal rates, et cetera. We're a very happy with what we're seeing, but we're not discussing those figures publicly. 
On your earlier question, I just wanted to add to Tom's answer just to make sure that you understood. It is not so much that the fixed costs are being reduced in the back half of the year. In fact, those technology and content, for example, will probably go up in absolute dollars. It is just that as the Company continues to grow, the year-over-year growth in those numbers is less, and then as the top line grows, also we start to grow into that cost structure over the next few years. 
Operator
Our next question comes from Jeetil Patel, Deutsche Bank. 
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank
Great. Two questions. First of all, on Amazon Prime I guess you're seeing frequency growth overall in the business of about 5% to 6% year on year. Can you talk about the impact that Amazon Prime has? Are you seeing even faster frequency growth in that audience, or do you think it's actually attracting a different customer that may not have looked at Amazon previously in terms of the active account base? 
Second question: broadly, as you take a step back and look at the marketplace, it seems like subscriptions, rentals and also new product purchases and sales, they all represent just different ways of accessing content and information and products out there. How do you see your customer adapting to those different types of businesses or concepts out there? Do you think they are open to different solutions, different ways of accessing content, or do you think that it becomes still more of a retail business? 
Tom Szkutak
 I think our customers are very receptive to new kinds of offerings from us. Over time we have stretched the corners of how customers perceive us, and we have done that very successfully, transitioning from an online bookseller to being able to sell hardlines and now many more categories. 
At the same time, we have had success with two very, very different kinds of business models from a consumer point of view. One being the retail business model and the second one being the third-party business model, which as you know now is a significant percentage of our units where third-party sellers sell through the Amazon.com website. 
So not only have we kind of stretched the corners of how customers perceive us in terms of product category, but also in terms of business model. I think what we're seeing with Amazon Prime in our rental offerings is yet another business model that customers are giving us permission to pursue with them. 
So not only are we happy with the new subscription growth that we have seen in Amazon Prime, but if you look at our DVD rental business in the UK and Germany, those businesses are going very well, too. Having started free trial offers there, we're even seeing acceleration in those businesses as well, and that is off of a base that we were already happy with. 
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank
Jeff, do you think that some of these business models can still exist inside the same category at the same time so DVD rental, DVD club service versus DVD purchases all in one? 
Jeff Bezos
 Yes. In fact, we have announced that we're going to be doing a program called Upgrade that will allow people to buy physical books and then for a small incremental charge get online access to those books as well. So we do think that there are offerings which can co-exist. 
I would point to our third-party sales business where people can buy the new version of the book or the used version of the book or the reconditioned tool or the new tool or the new camera from somebody else. Instead of buying a new camera from us, go right from the Amazon website. That is another example of where you have two quite dissimilar business models interacting very nicely even on the same detail page. 
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank
Do you employ a lot of the data between different products, different business models today or not really in terms of the used pricing versus new pricing, etc.? 
Jeff Bezos
 I'm sorry. Could you say that again? 
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank
So are you leveraging a lot of the data and knowledge base from what you learn in used, what consumers are willing to pay for a particular product to, let's say, in the content area, what they are willing to pay for by chapter or by different formats for a used model versus a pure buy model? 
Jeff Bezos 
Not necessarily that particular example, but we do have things. For example, we can see which subcategories of books performed best inside things like Search Inside! the Book. So when we offer Search Inside! the Book, which allows people to do full text searches and view certain portions of books, we can see which subcategories of books do services like that perform better in. Then we can think about how can we extend those offerings in those kinds of subcategories. So we do have a lot of very helpful data that we can view and use it as aid in making business decisions. 
Operator
Our next question comes from Justin Post, Merrill Lynch. 
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch
I think on the call you mentioned you would be able to cut pricing by about 150 basis points year-over-year to the consumer. I'm wondering if you are able to get better deals from your vendors? Are you able to pass that through, and that's what you're able to maintain the margins? 
The second thing, the shipping expense was up pretty consistent with the revenue growth. Do you expect any pressure from gas prices or Amazon Prime going forward? Then could you just remind me of the FAS 123 benefit that you got in the first quarter? 
Tom Szkutak
 Sure. In terms of impact on COGS in your pricing question, yes, it is an ongoing effort everyday to try to get better prices from our suppliers, and certainly our goal is to help pass that on in terms of lower prices to customers. So that is an everyday activity that we do globally. 
In terms of shipping expense, in terms of the inflation that you mentioned, certainly that is something that we have been dealing with for several years with oil prices and energy prices where they are. We have seen a dramatic increase over the last several years. So it is just something that we have been managing over the past several years. I'm not sure what more to say about that. Then the last part of your question, I'm sorry? 
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch
Yes, the FAS 123 benefit that you got in the first quarter, I think you gave that number. 
Tom Szkutak
Yes, it is $13 million over the past 12 months and it is $7 million in Q1. 
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch
 Okay. We will get back to that later. Thank you. 
Operator
Our next question comes from Robert Peck, Bear Stearns. 
Tom Szkutak
 I'm sorry, you were talking about expense or the impact on free cash flow? I'm not sure -- you're talking about the stock-based compensation expense or the impact on free cash flow? 
Operator
 I'm sorry, Mr. Post. Could you please requeue? 
Tom Szkutak
Well, if he is not back on. The expense piece was $11 million. Stock-based compensation was $11 million in Q1, which was down from $19 million from last year. Then the impact of 123R on free cash flow was $7 million in Q1 or $13 million over the trailing 12 months, if that is helpful. That covered both bases. 
Robert Peck - Bear Stearns
 Tom, this is Bob Peck. Am I live? 
Tom Szkutak
 Yes. 
Robert Peck - Bear Stearns
 Okay. Great. I got two questions for you. The first is sort of a two-parter, though. Are you able to break out your tech spending as far as investment versus maintenance, and investment meaning your newer initiatives, not necessarily along the course, just A9, S3, et cetera.? 
And part two of that is considering a lot of the initiatives you're taking are very similar to things that Google is doing, does it ever make sense for you to consider any sort of partnership with Google? Then I have got a follow-up. 
Tom Szkutak
Okay. In terms of our technology and content spend, we look at it a number of different ways. We look at it certainly from a maintenance mode, an investment mode. But we look at it on an individual program basis as well. So again, we're looking at all the individual programs that we do. We review that regularly, so it is part of our planning process. In terms of partnerships and any other discussion, you know we have a long-standing practice of not talking about any particular company. 
Robert Peck - Bear Stearns
Okay. Because you can see the synergies there if you did. The second question would be on Amazon Prime, really quickly. The Amazon Prime subs right now, are they profitable? With the release of eBay Express, what is your opinion of the impact of eBay Express on Amazon longer-term? Thank you. 
Tom Szkutak
We do not as a matter of practice talk about other companies and definitely stick to that. I would say more generally there are going to be and there have been thousands of competitors, and there should be in this space. These are very big markets, and there can be lots of winners. What was the other part of your question? 
Robert Peck - Bear Stearns
 Are the Prime subs profitable? 
Tom Szkutak
They are profitable on their own basis, so that each one is profitable. They are less profitable than if they did that same amount of shopping without getting free shipping. So the two-day free shipping makes them much less profitable than they would be otherwise. So do you understand what I'm saying? 
Robert Peck - Bear Stearns
 I do. 
Operator
Our next question comes from Mark Rowen, Prudential. 
Mark Rowen - Prudential
A couple of quick questions. One on the Toys ""R"" Us, you're saying that it is going to be $100 million impact for the year if it works out unfavorably to you. I noticed in the lawsuit that they were really fighting about the $50 million payment. So in that $100 million, are you assuming that you don't replace them with another third-party seller or your own sales? Is that like a worst-case scenario? 
Tom Szkutak
 I don't know where the numbers you are describing are coming from, the $100 million. What we had mentioned was that it could be up to $50 million for the year in operating profit. 
Mark Rowen - Prudential
 Okay. So $50 million for the year. So is that the excess payment that they made that you could not replace by putting another third-party seller in there, or do you think you could make some of that up if you did put another third-party seller in there with a higher commission or whatever? 
Jeff Bezos
Yes, Mark, as you can probably appreciate, this is a matter of ongoing litigation, and I don't think it is appropriate to talk further about it. I think we have given adequate commentary in the opening remarks about it. At this stage, I would like to keep it to that. 
Mark Rowen - Prudential
 Okay. My second question, it relates to your North American media business. A lot of the other sellers of those products, particularly in music and movies, have been struggling over the last year, music probably longer than that. Are those categories still good for you? Are you still gaining share in a shrinking market, or are the effects of the market shrinking impacting those categories? Is it really books that is driving that category? 
Tom Szkutak
 When you look at the growth rates for North American media, we are still seeing very solid double-digit growth. It is up 15% year over year, 16% on a TTM basis. So we think it is a very good business for us. There has certainly been a lot of innovation and improvements in customer experience over the past few years within that space, which we think is paying off for us. 
Mark Rowen - Prudential 
So it is paying off in all of those categories, not just books? 
Tom Szkutak
Yes, we have not broken out any of the individual categories within media, but we are certainly pleased with the individual categories that make that up. 
Operator
Our next question comes from Shawn Milne, Friedman Billings Ramsey. 
Shawn Milne - Friedman Billings Ramsey
A quick question, Tom, on the flow of your business in the first quarter. If you look at some data from the third party, it looks like online spending was strong in January. It was a bit weaker in February and then rebounded in March. Can you talk about the flow of your business if you saw any of those trends? 
The March data actually would suggest an acceleration in online spending heading into April. Any thoughts on that? Thanks. 
Tom Szkutak
 Again, we are certainly running a business in a number of different countries. So I don't think it's appropriate to talk about individual months. But certainly when you look at our overall growth for the quarter, you're seeing an acceleration. You saw 22% growth in Q4 on a local currency basis, just under 25% in Q1. So again, you saw an acceleration there. But talking much more beyond that in terms of individual months, we're not going to do today. 
Shawn Milne - Friedman Billings Ramsey
You talked about buying directly more in inventory. Are you buying toy inventory currently? 
Tom Szkutak
No, I'm not going to comment more on the toy business. 
Kim Nelson 
Thank you for your questions. A replay will be available at our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter. 
Tom Szkutak
 Thank you. 
Jeff Bezos
 Thank you.

Thomas J. Szkutak, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Tim. This was another successful year for Amazon.com. We significantly expanded our live proposition for customers and we are grateful to our customers, our global teams and our partners for helping deliver these results.
Let me start by reviewing 2005 in full. Trailing twelve months free cash flow grew 11% to a record $529 million. Trailing twelve months free cash flow includes a one-time payment of $40 million in connection with a patent lawsuit settlement in Q3 of ’05. Excluding this settlement, 2005 free cash flow grew 19% to $569 million. Free cash flow is operating cash flow minus capital expenditures.
As a reminder, the financial measures we are working to maximize over the long-term is free cash flow per share. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding with 438 million shares compared with 434 million shares of 1%. Stock-based awards outstanding were 22 million or 5.2% of shares outstanding, down from 25 or 6% of shares outstanding.
Return on invested capital was 34%; ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus average current liability. Revenue grew 23% to $8.49 billion or 24% excluding the $73 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. US market grew 22% to 4.7 billion and International grew 23% to 3.8 billion 25% year-over-year growth excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates.
Gross profit grew 27% to 2.04 billion and gross margin increased 87 basis points to 24%. Consolidated segment operating income grew 16% to $566 million or 17% excluding $8 million of unfavorable year-over-year impact of foreign exchange. And operating margins decreased 41 basis points to 6.7%.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $221 million to $2.0 billion. In Q1 of ’05 we repurchased €200 millions of our convertible debt. And as separately announced today, we will be redeeming €250 million, or approximately $300 million at recent euro/dollar exchange rates, a principal amount of our €6.78 (ph) denominated convertible debt notes to 2000 incentive parts was accrued in unpaid interest. This redemption mitigates potential solution of over 2.9 million shares and reduces our annual cash interest expense by approximately $21 million.
Inventory increased 18% or $556 million and inventory turns decreased from 16 to 14 as we bolstered inventory levels for customers by optimizing in stock levels across product categories and expanding the process of product category selection in our performance centers. We will continue to increase our direct buying efforts in existing and new product categories enabling us to extend even lower prices to customers.
Our investment in fixed assets, which includes net capitalized software development costs, increased to $101 million from a year ago to $348 million, of which $87 million is capitalized software development cost. Our 2005 capital expenditures were $204 million, of which $79 million were software development cost.
Now I’ll discuss the fourth quarter. Revenue grew 17% to $2.98 billion or 22% excluding $121 million of unfavorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange. Worldwide unit growth for the quarter was also at 22%. Third party units representing marketplace and merchandise units sold on Amazon sites were 28% of total units, up from 26%.
For the first time North America Media surpassed $1 billion and North America Electronics and General Merchandise exceeded $500 million. The Worldwide Electronics and other General Merchandise increased 31% to $901 million or 36% excluding of that, representing 30% of worldwide sales, up from 27%.
Active customer accounts, representing customers who ordered in the past year, surpassed 55 million, up 19%. Gross profit grew 23% to $667 million, and gross margin increased 98 basis points to 22.4% primarily due to increased third-party sales, changes in the geographic mix of business, and $19 million increase in other revenue primarily Amazon enterprise solutions formerly known as merchant.com, partially offset by greater shipping loss driven by free shipping in Amazon Prime, our lower product prices and continued mix shift of EGM. In Q4, we offered free short-term membership trails for Amazon clients and although they are expensive we expect to continue offering of these trails to our customer base in the future.
Now, I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation expense under FAS 123R, which we adopted early in Q1 of ‘05. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $482 million or 16.2% of sales, up 175 basis points. Fulfillment was $246 million or 8.3% of sales, up 26 basis points. In 2005, we expanded our fulfillment capacity through efficiency gains as well as increases in leased warehouse space in order to accommodate greater selection and meet anticipated shipment volumes from ourselves as well as third parties for whom we provide the fulfillment. In 2006, we expect to increase our performance base less than in 2005 to expand our capacity to touch that peak demand. For example, we intend to expand our warehouse space in Germany.
Marketing was $67 million or 2.2% of sales, roughly flat as a percentage of sales year-over-year. Technology and content was $123 million or 4.1% of sales, up 127 basis points as we continue to hire computer scientists and software engineers to further innovate for customers in areas such as our Seller Platforms, Search, Web Services and Digital. Q4 ’05 represents an annual run-rate of approximately $500 million as we enter 2006. In 2006, we will continue investing in our long-term opportunities, innovating on behalf of customers. We expect technology and content cost to continue to grow in absolute dollars, and our 2006 year-over-year percentage growth rate to be lower in 2005. G&A was $46 million or 1.5% of sales, up 27 basis points. G&A cost increased primarily due to payroll and related expenses, professional fees and legal cost.
Now I’ll talk about our segment results. Consistent with prior periods we don’t allocate stock-based compensation or other operating expenses to our segments. In the North America segment, revenue grew 21% to $1.7 billion. Media grew 16% to $1 billion, and EGM grew 29% to $580 million representing 34% of North America revenues, up from 32%. Apparels, Jewelry and Sporting Goods revenue all more than doubled year-over-year. Other revenue was up 25% primarily from Amazon enterprise solutions. Gross profit grew 18% to $418 million, and gross margin decreased 64 basis points to 24.8% largely due to Amazon Prime and free shipping products and service mix and our price reductions across product categories partially offset by third party sales.
North America segment operating income increased $30 million to $92 million or 5.5% operating margin. In the International segment revenue grew 13% to $1.3 billion. Revenue growth was 23% adjusting for the $122 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange during the quarter. Media revenue grew 6% to 968 million, or 16% excluding the foreign exchange rates. EGM grew 36% to $321 million or 49% excluding FX representing 25% of international revenues up from 21%. Gross profit grew 31% to $249 million of gross margin increase of 273 basis points to 19.3% primarily from an increase of third party sales and from vendor management including discounts from suppliers, partially offset by increased free shipping, product price reductions and product mix shift.
International segment operating income increased $37 million to $93 million, and operating margin increased 233 basis points to 7.1%. This important to our numbers that are significant majority by technology and content costs are incurred in US with most of them allocated to the North America segment. The combination of operating income and our North America and international segment is a consolidated segment operating income or CSOI. Our segment information financial statement in our press release reconciles CSOI to GAAP operating income. CSOI grew 4% to $185 million or 11% excluding this $12 million unfavorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange rate. Unlike CSOI our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income increased 1% to $165 million; excluding the $12 million impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates operating income increased 9% to a $176 million.
Our positions for income taxes includes a tax benefit of $90 million in Q4 of ’05 or $0.21 per diluted share related to our determination at certain of our deferred tax assets are realizable. Without the benefit of this change, our effective tax rate was 43% in 2005, higher than the 35% statutory rate. Resulting from the transfer of certain operating assets from the US to international locations in connection with establishing our EU headquarters in Luxembourg.
We will transfer additional assets in 2006 to finalize the European headquarters transition, and we will expect this will result in an effective tax rate significantly higher than the statutory rate for 2006. But we have deferred tax assets related to our NOLs, these active transfers will not have a significant impact on our cash taxes paid in 2006, which we expect to be approximately $25 million compared with $12 million in 2005. We are endeavoring to optimize our global taxes on a cash pay basis not for tax expense on a financial reporting basis.
GAAP net income was $199 million or $0.47 per diluted share compared with $347 million or $0.82 per diluted share. Excluding the $90 million tax benefit in 2005, and the $244 million tax benefit in 2004 GAAP net income would have been $110 million or $0.26 per diluted share in Q4 of ’05 and $102 million or $0.24 per diluted share in Q4 of ’04.
Our growth continues to be fueled by our relentless focus on the primary inputs of customer experience: convenience, selection and price. Some recent examples of our progress include Amazon Prime. We continue to be pleased with the Amazon Prime results, subscriptions to Amazon Prime more than doubled from November to December. We’ve seen increased purchases by Amazon Prime customers across more categories, with especially heavy purchases in electronics, kitchen, and health and personal care. For $79 a year, Amazon Prime members get all-you-can-eat free 2-day shipping.
Our Search Inside the Book technology is now available in six geographies, most recently in Japan, where customers can preview the tax inside over a 160,000 books. Building on our successful Search Inside the Book technology, the digital team also announced it is currently developing two innovative programs: Amazon Pages, and Amazon Upgrade, to benefit readers, authors and publishers, it will enable customers to purchase online access to any page, section or chapter of a book as well as the book in its entirety.
Our German site amazon.de, launched it press delivery in Q4 giving customers the ability order eligible products by 7:30 PM for guaranteed delivery by noon the next day. Worldwide active seller accounts, merchants with an order from the customer during the preceding 12 months exceeded 1.05 million, up 24% year-over-year.
Amazon’s China site joyo.com, in a long-term test lowered the older site threshold for customers to qualify for free shipping from RMB99 to RMB200, and offers more than 300,000 books music, video and DVD titles, making it the largest Chinese book store in the world.
Amazon’s Japan site, amazon.co.jp launched its sport store with over 100,000 items and more than 600 brands across 17 categories, including baseball, golf and soccer. Some price highlights include the average customer discounts across book, music and video products purchased on www.amazon.com increased over 175 basis points year-over-year. The average customer discount for electronics products on www.amazon.com increased over 50 basis points year-over-year. Customers saved over $475 million on shipping through our worldwide free shipping offers in Amazon Prime in 2005.
I will conclude my portion of today’s call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. However, there is a high level of uncertainty surrounding fluctuation in the Euro, Pound, Yen, Canadian Dollar and Yuan exchange rates, as well as the global economy and consumer spending and the impact on both of world events. While we are cautiously optimistic, it is not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
Let me also remind everyone that we mark our euro-denominated debt-to-market at the end of each quarter, which results in a gain or loss for any movement in the euro between reporting dates. We also have Euro exposure related to our interest expense on this Euro-denominated debt. We incur a foreign currency gain or loss corresponding with inter-company balances denominated in foreign currencies, which is settled among subsidiaries. Depending on the amount and timing and unfavorable resolution of outstanding legal matters could materially affect our business, results of operations, financial position or cash flows in a particular period.
Our effective tax rate in 2006 is subject to significant variation based on changes in our corporate structure and business operations, the amount of expenses incurred that are permanently non-deductible for US tax purposes, such as stock-based compensation paid to foreign employees, the tax characterization of income earned and changes in current tax laws and estimates, including variability and predicting our taxable income in the taxable jurisdictions to which you relate. Our guidance assumes that we don’t record any additional intangible assets or any further revisions to stock-based compensation or restructuring-related estimates, and that FX rates remain approximately where they have been recently.
For our Q1, we expect net sales of between $2.14 billion and $2.29 billion, or growth of between 13% and 20%. This guidance anticipates more than 75 million or over 400 basis points of negative impacts from foreign exchange due to the dollar’s continued strength. GAAP operating income to be between 70 million and 105 million, or between a negative 35% and negative 3% decline. This includes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets of approximately $30 million. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which includes the negative impact of foreign exchange and excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $100 million and $135 million or between a negative 22% decline and 5% growth.
For calendar year 2006, we expect net sales of between $9.85 billion and $10.45 billion, a growth of between 16% and 23%. This guidance anticipates approximately $100 million or over a 100 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange rates.
GAAP operating income to be between $370 million and $510 million or between a 14% decline and an 18% growth. This includes approximately $135 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which includes the negative impact of foreign exchange and excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $505 million and $645 million or 11% decline and 14% growth.
Operating leverage should accelerate in second half of the year compared with the first half of the year. We expect our 2006 free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to the operating profit growth rate year-over-year. This excludes the impact of FAS 123R, which may result in upto $100 million of tax benefits from stock-based compensation to be classified as positive financing cash flows instead of operating cash flows up from $7 million in 2005. And we expect capital expenditures including capitalized software development cost to be approximately $225 million.
Our strategy is to remain relevantly focused on customer experience with our financial focus on long-term growth of free cash flow per share. We believe the investments we have made and will make in 2006 in the form of lower prices and free shipping as well as investments in further technology innovation of the right investments for future free cash flow. In the last 4 years, we’ve generated nearly $1.5 billion in free cash flow while investing $1.1 billion in technology and content, and customer saved over $1.25 billion on shipping since we’ve made free shipping a permanent offer and introduced Amazon Prime for customers, on top of our prices which continue to lower.
We will continue to strive for year-over-year annual growth of free cash flow and free cash flow per share on investing in our long-term opportunities. We are confident that we’ll continue to improve customer experience and execute efficiently our value proposition as well as our free cash flow will further expand.
Thanks and with that Tim let’s move to questions.
Tim Stone, Vice President, Investor Relations
Great thanks Tom. Let’s move on to the Q&A portion of the call, Jeff and Tom. Operator will you please remind once more of the Q&A process?
Questions-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you, Mr. Stone. If you would ask a question please do so by pressing the “*�? key followed by the digit “1�? on your touchtone telephone. If you are using a speakerphone, please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. We’ll proceed in the order that you signal us and we’ll take as many questions as time permits. Once again it is “*�? “1�? on your touchtone telephone to signal for questions.
And we’ll take our first question today from Anthony Noto with Goldman Sachs.
Q - Anthony Noto
Jeff, in the past, you and I’ve talked about – similar just I’ve asked you questions about the structural challenges outside the books, music and video that I thought were apparent. As we’re focused in the books, music and video business, just excluding then a business that is really advanced that is from competitive advantages and keeping a little cost operator being able to give consumers lower prices than being loyal to better selection. As you think about that business in the next 5 to 10 years, and the impact this may have on the profitability, do you worry about the profitability that business is eroding giving the digital margins are much lower than the physical margins? And then secondly, 2006 was like it’s going be the third year in which your incremental margins have trended below the prior year, which means you continue to invest. At what point does that investment end and we start to a rise in your incremental margins and a return in that investment? Thank you.
A - Thomas J. Szkutak
Sure thanks Anthony, and by the way I think you had twins yesterday, congratulations on that.
Q - Anthony Noto
Thank you.
A - Thomas J. Szkutak
If you look at our digital investment, we’re excited about the opportunity there going forward. In this physical world, now that’s where the vast majority of media products are sold today in physical stores. And as we move forward with digital, we think Amazon is especially well-positioned to capture bigger part of that business, while media products are physical, it makes a lot of sense for a big fraction of them to be sold in physical stores, and I think that there will be a sustainable margins there after those players who can create a very good customer experience, and that’s what we are working on doing. And the second part of the question, I forgot.
Q - Anthony Noto
It was just that 2006 looks like it will be the third year in which your incremental profitability is lower than the prior year, which implies you’re investing again for the future, and I just wondering at what point do we see that investment go off and a return in the investment hit the P&L which we would measure as an improvement in incremental margins?
A - Thomas J. Szkutak
Well if you look at 2005, it was definitely a year where we increased our cost structure significantly. We did that deliberately and we did it because we see a lot of opportunity going forward. I do think that we will see over the next couple of years that we will be able to - we’ll start to see the utilization of that cost structure over the next couple of years.
Q - Anthony Noto
Thank you.
A - Thomas J. Szkutak
Thanks Anthony.
Operator
We’ll take our next question from Robert Peck, Bear Stearns.
Q - Robert Peck
For following on Anthony’s question there, could you maybe quantify or shape for us with the investments you’re making, what portions are going to newer initiatives A9, Alexa, what portion is going for Amazon Prime, because Amazon Prime - could you maybe quantify how many current sub you have for Amazon Prime?
A - Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of the investments we’re making, we’re making a number of investments that are short-term, intermediate and longer term. And we haven’t quantified the pieces but certainly we should look at the investments we’re making in A9 as being longer term, our digital web services are certainly longer-term initiatives for us. But again, we’re making a number of different initiatives, Amazon Prime certainly is one that we’re investing in today, it is expensive, and that being said, the earlier results that we see we like, we’re seeing, the customers that are Amazon Prime members are shopping more, they’re doing more cross-shopping, we saw a nice increase in subscriptions and Q4 with subscriptions doubling from November-December so, we’re seeing some positive signs, its still very early but we see positive signs and we would like, so we would like what we see there.
A - Jeffrey P. Bezos
And I would just add that Amazon Prime while very expensive, we see in at the same potential that we had with the three supersaver shipping. That was very expensive and yet it really improved the customer experience and we think to have a very good business results over the medium-term and that’s exactly what we would expect to have happen with Amazon Prime.
Q - Robert Peck
And a quick follow-up, could you maybe give us your thoughts on competition from eBay Express, Google Base and Freemont, what that can mean to your future growth?
A - Thomas J. Szkutak
Well we have a long standing practice of not talking about other companies but more generally, what I can tell you is that we believe and have believed for a long time that the internet is driving better and better consumer information. And as a result, we believe the companies that delivers sincerely better customer experiences, which includes competitive pricing, it includes reliable fast delivery, it includes having the right selection and the inventory and stock and available that those important customer experience and drivers will shine through in a world that has increasingly better consumer information. And I think many of the things that we see happening on the internet fit into that trend of better and better information, more empowerment for consumers, from where we sit because of the way we’ve operated the business, we like that trend.
Operator
We’ll take our next question from Heath Terry with Credit Suisse Asset Management.
Q - Heath Terry
Great thanks. Can you talk to us a little bit about products, your international product strategy, and I know I’ve asked this question before but as you continue to see success in areas outside of the - or in areas that you don’t currently offer in other markets, what’s the thought process behind expanding your product portfolio internationally to mere the one that you’ve got in the US?
A - Thomas J. Szkutak
Sure. We, in terms of additional selection, you should expect going forward that we are going to add additional influx in the categories that we’re in. You should expect that we’re going to launch new category certainly overtime in international as well. When we launch new categories, I was trying to learn how to give the best possible customer experience that we can, we’ve learned from that and then we expand to other geographies. And so that’s how we think about it, and traditionally, you know that has happened before starting with the US, but certainly, over the past few years, we’ve all, focused on that and all of the geographies we are in.
Q - Heath Terry
So there is certain limitations in the international markets that have tapped you from entering categories there that have been successful here?
A - Jeffrey P. Bezos
No I wouldn’t say there are structural limitations there, as we build out categories we need to build supply chains, vendor relationships and so on. So there is the deliberate effort that takes time as we go through in opening those categories, we used the data from whatever market we first open in, we use that data to help prioritize which category as we do next in other geographies. But our selection goals, well first of all in terms of category expansion, our long-term vision it has got all of the geographies to be the same. So any story you see in any - in any category you see in any geography you will see in all the geographies. So that’s a long-term vision. And then within each category, we also continue to add selection. So even in categories, even in US books, the category that we’ve been working on the longest, even in that category over this past year, we added significant selection.
Q - Heath Terry
Thank you.
A - Thomas J. Szkutak
Thank you.

From CIBC World Markets, Paul Keung.
Q - Paul Keung
Hi, looking at free cash flow growth its been, you sell it some in the mid-teens and back at this year, and then based on your guidance, it looks like you are looking for free cash flow both next year and a mid point somewhere plus or minus 10%. So, based on this a question I guess very similar to that as Anthony, I mean as you claim your business out, and if you look at the range of guidance for next year, is it possible to manage a business group – may not go next year or do you actually manage actively the kind of, to the same growth comparable to your topline?
A - Thomas J. Szkutak
Well certainly, we have a focus on trying to make sure that we grow free cash flow and free cash flow per share overtime, certainly, its certainly a key element that we look at and certainly most important measure. That being said we are going to make sure we do the right thing for long-term investors as well and as you look at 2006 specifically, we think that free cash flow will trend largely with operating income. And as you look at the guidance you can see that based on the Q1 guidance that we’ve given and the total year guidance that we’ve given, that we expect that the leverage would be slightly be better in the second half versus the first half. So again, as you look at free cash flow it’s, we think it will trend inline with how I described.
Q - Paul Keung
Is that more specific to your OpEx, or is it the capital spending that’s causing them?
A - Thomas J. Szkutak
Yes, if you look at the operating expense for 2005, and the buildup that we’ve had through the course of the year, you’ve seen that, very specifically, our total operating expenses are up 127 basis points, our technology and content is 115 basis points of that increase. And as Jeff described earlier, that’s because of the opportunities that we see. We are going to still increase technology and content next year, we are going to hire more software development engineers and computer scientists, but I would not expect that the increased technology and content in 2006 to be as great as 2005. So again, you have the base that we have that as you see as in Q4, and then the elements that I described, which would mean that, as you get closer to the back half of the year, will be lapping some of the big increases that you saw in 2005.
Q - Paul Keung
Got it, I see and a real quick one. I’ve seen some interesting things you’ve done in Alexa, IMDb and on the Search, I was curious, is there any monetization of those assets in your ‘06 forecast?
A - Thomas J. Szkutak
Sure, yeah, the, certainly the IMDb will certainly be monetized, that today, it’s an interesting business for us and, certainly to cooperate into the guidance for 2006.
Q - Paul Keung
Yeah, thanks.
Operator
Next we’ll hear from Jeetil Patel with Deutsche Bank.
Q - Jeetil Patel
Hi guys two questions, first of all can you talk about just overall market wise, that UK ecommerce market is there any interesting new onsets challenges, changes in the market dynamic there from economy standpoints, maybe a slowdown, as you went throughout the quarter? Second, can you talk about, I guess the third party business in Europe and is that, are you getting enough selection in broadly in the international markets to drive relevant and drive transactions, or do you think there is still opportunity to build out selection to a third party platform there?
A - Thomas J. Szkutak
In terms of the, we’ve launched and in the practice of not talking about individual countries but if you look at certainly your international growth, we saw, we had very solid performance in our international segment in Q4. We grew revenue 13% on a dollar basis but 23% on a local currency basis, which was consistent with what we saw in Q1, a little bit below what we saw in Q3, - Q2 and Q3 with Q3 had Harry Potter fixed in it, where our operating performance in total was very strong with gross margins being at the highest level its been in sometime, gross profit being up 44%, and CSOI growing 89%, so strong overall operating performance in international. And then in terms of the third party it continues to be a big part of our overall mix globally in both segments. As I’ve mentioned in the opening comments the third party mix is 28% of our total units globally, that’s up from 26% in 2000, Q4 2004 and we still see a lot of opportunities to add selection as the seller as well as third party selection.
A - Jeffrey P. Bezos
Operator, next question?
Operator
Next we’ll hear from Safa Rashtchy, Piper Jaffray.
Q - Safa Rashtchy
Good afternoon, could you talk about the investments that you are making in the digital area, what is needed to get that operation going assuming in the next few years you will have a sizable part of your media available in digital format, in addition to obviously securing those titles from the content providers, and having some basic technology which I assume is already available? What else do you need to do to get there, and can you give us some color on these investments you’re making? Thanks.
A - Jeffrey P. Bezos
It’s a good question that’s premature for me to talk in any detail about those initiatives, we will, you just have to stay tuned on what we are doing there.
Q - Safa Rashtchy
Okay, then if I could do a follow-up on a different topic, and Tom could you talk about your expectations on return on equity, do you expect it to continue to increase or given the investment mode that you are in, and a decrease in operating income on ’06, what should we expect on ROE?
A - Thomas Szkutak
Sure, we hadn’t, we are not giving guidance on ROE specifically, but certainly, our return on invested capital if you will was 32% for the year, and again, we still think it’s something that we utilize capital very efficiently, and we think that there is a lot of opportunity overtime to improve that.

Next question comes from Jim Friedland, SG Cowen.
Q - Jim Friedland
Thanks. Can you give an update on a regulatory front, if there is any visibility when you might need to collect sales tax beyond the states where you have physical operations?
A - Thomas J. Szkutak
No this is not a lifetime new there, we collect sales tax in a few states today, and we continue to work, try to help legislators come up with something that’s simple.
Q - Jim Friedland
And in the states where you do collect sales taxes is there any kind of meaningful difference in the dynamic between the way your customers purchase versus others states like maybe not buying as many big ticket items, things like that?
A - Thomas J. Szkutak
No, in fact it’s not just the individual states that you sell to, you need to be aware that we collect value-added tax and the countries that require it, and have been doing so for since inception, so again we have a lot of other data points, on the states that we collecting.
Q - Jim Friedland
Okay great thanks.

Moving on to Imran Khan with JP Morgan.
Q - Imran Khan
Yes, hi Jeff and Tom, in terms of, you are investing lot of money in increasing customers’ experience, if I look at that revenue growth rate, your US and International business growing at the same rate. So two questions, in terms of international, what can you do to accelerate the growth rate because I am assuming the market set is probably bigger than US. And secondly, if you look at the US numbers, I know you don’t report gross margin that’s volume but how do you think about the market share because if I look at the ecommerce market that’s probably growing like 24-25%, you are reporting 21% revenue growth. So do you think you are losing market share, or the growth is coming from other categories and if so if you see an opportunity to expand into those categories? Thank you.
A - Thomas J. Szkutak
Sure, I’ll take the North America piece first, I think we’ve made, good progress we’ve looked at our share on a product category – by product category basis. We think we are doing pretty well there, if you look at the results that we’ve had, our North America revenue grew 22% in 2005. That’s actually an acceleration up from 400 basis points, up 400 basis points from 2004. If you just look at the history, 2005 with 22% growth, 2004 was 18%, 2003 18%, 2002 12%, and 2001 3%. So again, you see some nice progress of the past five years in terms of growth and so, the challenge going forward is how can we continue to accelerate that growth. In terms of international, we still think there is a lot of opportunity as you mentioned, we are going to as I mentioned earlier, its going to continue to expand selection in the categories we are in. We are going to expand into new categories overtime, certainly overtime we should expect that’s also launched new countries, certainly we are going to invest more in pricing as well and continue to focus our resources on improving the customer experience. So those are things that we think we can do to improve our growth there, and will certainly get a lot of our attention.
Q - Imran Khan
Okay thanks.

Next question is from Mark Rowen with Prudential.
Q - Mark Rowen
If I could, two questions actually, the first if I could just follow-up on Imran’s question. So when you look at the international growth in media products and also consumer electronics, they tend to be trending about the same now as North America. And would you say that, as you go country-by-country, in Germany and the UK and Japan and France? Are you at similar levels of penetration in those product categories as you are in the US and North America? And is that why the growth is sort of trending at the same level or is that something specific going on internationally that’s causing the growth to decelerate towards that trend line and then I have another question if I could?
A - Thomas J. Szkutak
Sure, I think if you look at the categories that we are in outside of the US, we are actually in each of the countries in less categories outside of the US than inside of the US, so its certainly an opportunity for us to grow, and again I think if you look at the deceleration that you just described, in Q4 specifically, again if you look at our total performance, you see that the performance is certainly the revenues is growing 23% excluding exchange which is, higher than our North America growth, but on top of that our gross profit is up 44%, our gross margins are up 273 basis points. Our CSOI excluding exchange is up 89%. So again, we have a strong overall performance, what we need to make sure going forward is that we, we have good balance between growth and profitability and driving free cash flow off our international. So that’s what we are thinking about it. Did you said you had another follow-up question?
Q - Mark Rowen
Yeah just on that one also, so would you say that you are at similar levels of market share and say the media products categories in places like the UK and Germany as you are in the US?
A - Thomas J. Szkutak
Yeah we haven’t disclosed our market segment share, results by country or anything, but I would certainly say there is, certainly very sizeable opportunities both inside the US and outside of the US and, even outside of the categories that we in, again we are in, we are just in less categories today outside the US than in the US, and so there is certainly a lot of opportunity and so globally.
Q - Mark Rowen
Okay my other question is for Jeff, Jeff you’ve said for a long time that your model more efficient than the traditional retail model, because you don’t have to invest in real estate virtual, which always goes up and instead you tend to invest in technology, which goes down. But if I add up all of your expenses as a percent of revenue and adding free shipping which is sort of view as a marketing expense, I think in 2005, it was a little over 20% and in the fourth quarter little over 19% which is 200 or 300 basis points higher than a company like Wal-Mart, so could you sort of just give us an idea why that such a paradox, why is that we are not seeing more efficiency if in fact the model is more efficient?
A - Jeffrey P. Bezos
Well, I think one thing to keep in mind is that if we were not investing in some of these new initiatives, such as digital and web services, our cost structure would be different toady. So if we were totally optimizing our cost structure for a kind of steady state business you’d see a different cost structure. Other things that we talk about that you may remember are if you look at the return on investing capital, the dynamics between our business and traditional retail are very different in large part because of the efficiency of our capital model, high inventory turns, low PP&E.
Q - Mark Rowen
Okay thanks.
A - Thomas J. Szkutak
Sure.

We will be taking our final question from Justin Post of Merrill Lynch.
Q - Justin Post
Yeah, couple of things about gross profit which actually surprise me upside versus our forecast, it looks like gross profit in Europe was really strong, was there a product mix. I think you mentioned some vendor improvement, is that sustainable? And then on the other revenue growth, has the credit card growth kind of flattened down a little bit here and can you give us any outlook an what do you think for other revenues going forward?
A - Thomas J. Szkutak
Sure in international, we did see a very positive vendor management, we did see a positive from third parties, we also saw from, you mention mix actually the product mix, we had EGM which is a lower margin, actually grew at faster rate, so that actually was, hurt gross margin if you will. But then also, partially offsetting the expansion that we saw was certainly lower prices to our customers. So that’s kind of the picture on the international side. On the other in North America, yeah, we saw a very good growth in our merchant.com business if you will, out third party business growth and, we have two big pieces that roll through after North America, the other pieces are co-branded credit card, we did have a very large 2004 Q4, as we had mentioned before and we are lapping that so that was essentially flat, so the third party business so that’s our merchant.com business was very strong.
Q - Justin Post
Great and just a follow-up, is the improvement in Europe the same or whether there was some one-time buys that really helped you out in the fourth quarter?
A - Thomas J. Szkutak
Yeah, as I talk about it earlier, the challenge was you described as Europe, it’s actually international which includes our Asia business as well. But, the challenge with our international segment is to make sure that we have a good balance between unit growth and profitability. And so which you saw is, certainly growth in international it was stronger excluding exchange that we saw in North America. But again, we had expansions in gross margins and operating margins there. So the challenge going forward is we need to make sure that that is balanced and that we get both, strong growth and profitability of free cash flow there.
Q - Justin Post
