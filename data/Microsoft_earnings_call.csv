Greetings, and welcome to the Microsoft Fiscal Year 2019 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mike Spencer, General Manager, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.
Michael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.
Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and Carolyn Frantz, Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary.
On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provides a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.
All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses perform, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only.
We'll post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website.
During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, forms 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Thank you, Mike, and thanks to everyone on the phone for joining. We're off to a very strong start in fiscal 2019, delivering record revenue and profit. Every organization today needs tech intensity to compete and grow in an increasingly digital world.
There are two aspects to this. Think of it as a simple equation. First, every organization needs to be a fast adopter of best-in-class technology, second, they'll need to build their own proprietary digital capability. Our cloud platforms and tools enable our customers to build tech intensity, while ensuring we're addressing their tough questions around trust, both trust in technology and trust that they have a partner whose business model is aligned to their success.
No customer wants to be dependent on a provider that sells them technology on one end and competes with them on the other. Getting this equation right is key to their success going forward. Microsoft is uniquely positioned to help.
Now I'll briefly highlight how we are innovating across our solution areas. A little over a year ago, we introduced Microsoft 365 to help organizations of all sizes empower their employees in the modern workplace. Today it's a multi-billion dollar business that gives our customers a path to the cloud and broadens our reach with new and under-penetrated markets. Customers from large multinationals like Eli Lilly to Rio Tinto first-line field workers to small businesses that are all choosing Microsoft 365.
Cybersecurity is a central challenge. Microsoft Security differentiation is based on two things: first, our unparalleled operational security posture, second, our comprehensive product suite spanning identity, information, application and device protection.
We analyze more than 6.5 trillion signals each day, process 450 billion authentications monthly and scan 400 billion e-mails for malware and phishing each month. This massive signals generate insights that fuel security innovations for customers. New capabilities in Microsoft 365 detect, investigate and remediate sophisticated cybersecurity threats across every endpoint, saving IT professionals thousands of hours.
Microsoft Security Score gives organizations a dynamic report card on their security posture. In identity management, Microsoft is already a leader with Azure Active Directory and we are innovating with new capabilities to eliminate passwords for the hundreds of thousands of Azure AD connected apps that businesses use every day.
The future of productivity and collaboration will be defined by AI innovation and new AI-driven features across Microsoft 365 from automated slide design to proactive Cortana reminders to enhanced search experiences and real-time meeting transcription to org analytics are all augmenting human capability, making it easier for people to focus on what matters most.
Another differentiator is Microsoft Teams. Microsoft Teams is the only enterprise-grade solution that brings together messaging, video conferencing, meetings, and web-based collab into a single integrated user experience scaffolding. It eliminates the need for discrete single-point solutions that only increase an organization's security and compliance exposure.
Customers recognize this value. Teams is now the hub for teamwork for 329,000 organizations, including 87 of the Fortune 100 And we are adding automated translation support for meetings, shift scheduling for first-line workers, and new industry-specific offerings including healthcare and small business.
Windows 10 continues to gain traction in the enterprise as the most secure and productive operating system and more than half of our commercial device installed base is now on Windows 10. Surface continues to set the bar for the industry with five new category-leading Surface devices including the new Surface Go. Microsoft 365 and Surface are inspiring our OEM ecosystems to innovate and we have the strongest line of devices going into the holiday season.
Moving to business applications, AI-powered digital feedback loops that connect products, operations, customers, and employees to create predictive power, automate workflows, and ultimately improve outcomes are key to all organizations. Dynamics 365 uniquely addresses this need. We expect Dynamics to deliver more than $2.5 billion in revenue this year with half of that total coming from Dynamics 365.
And this quarter, we introduced Dynamics 365 AI, a new class of AI applications built for an era where the systems of record and engagement are converted into intelligence. Dynamics 365 Mixed Reality digitizes the physical spaces and interactions. Companies like Chevron and ZF Group are already using it to transform training and design for their first-line workers, and H&M, the world's second-largest clothing retailer is relying on Dynamics 365 to digitize its critical business processes.
These customers and others recognize the advantage of our modular extensible approach over the traditional SaaS model of monolithic suites of siloed apps. And our investments in our analytics and application platform spanning Power BI, PowerApps, and Flow are driving momentum with customers and have made us a leader in no-code app building and business analytics in the cloud.
Our Open Data Initiative, a strategic partnership with Adobe and SAP takes this even further, delivering on our vision of one unified data model to provide unparalleled business insight from behavioral, transactional, financial and operational data. Together we'll enable data to be exchanged and enriched across systems, making it a renewable resource that enables new intelligent customer experiences.
LinkedIn continues to be an essential platform to connect the world's professionals, with sessions growth of 34% year-over-year and record levels of messages sent and content shared. We're innovating with new experiences that leverage the LinkedIn and Microsoft Graphs such as the ability to e-mail LinkedIn connections directly from Microsoft 365. Strong engagement across the platform is fueling demand for sponsored content and marketing solutions and talent solutions, which saw record job postings again this quarter.
Talent Insights is a new self-service analytics solution that gives HR professionals competitive intelligence and labor market trends for an increasingly competitive jobs market. And the pending acquisition of Glint brings employee insights alongside LinkedIn's Workforce Insights to create a powerful solution to help customers attract, retain and develop the best talent.
Now turning to Azure. Customers from multinationals like Volkswagen, Anheuser-Busch InBev, Mastercard to fast-growing startups like Grab are recognizing the architectural advantage of a consistent computing stack from the cloud to the edge.
Azure is the only hyperscale cloud that extends to the edge across identity, data, application, platform, as well as security and management. We introduced 100 new Azure capabilities this quarter alone, focused on both existing workloads like security and new workloads like IoT and edge AI.
With Azure Confidential Computing, Azure is now the first cloud to provide a secure platform for protecting the confidentiality and the integrity of data while in use adding to our existing security protections to encrypt data in transit as well as in rest.
Every company needs a strategy to take advantage of the billions of IoT devices entering the market each year. Azure Sphere, our end-to-end solution for securing microcontroller powered devices is now broadly available and seeing strong customer interest. Azure Digital Twins is a new service that models relationships and interactions across people, places and devices.
We're investing to make Azure the best cloud for enterprise data. Our data services spanning SQL Database, Cosmos DB, Data Warehouse, and Data Lake provide the most comprehensive data platform needed for enterprise data estates. Azure ML builds on this foundation to further democratize data and AI to unlock insights, helping data scientists build and train AI models faster then deploy them through the cloud or to the Edge.
Across industries, our customers and partners are using services like these to transform. BMW introduced an agent to redefine how people interact with their cars. Beulah, which processes 65% of the world's grain, is relying on Azure Cognitive Services to improve food safety. Shell is applying AI across its enterprise to optimize deal productivity and keep workers safe. And this week at Sibos Conference, the Microsoft cloud is front and center, powering financial services transformation for organizations such as SWIFT, which is enabling secure payment transfers on Azure.
Finally, our pending acquisition of GitHub, which we expect to close shortly, recognizes the increasingly vital role developers play in value creation and growth across every industry. I'm excited about the opportunity to bring our tools and services to new audiences while enabling GitHub to grow and retain its developer-first ethos.
Now I'll turn to gaming. We continue to broaden our reach with more than 2 billion gamers worldwide and expand our opportunity, from the way games are distributed, to how they're played and viewed. We are investing in content, community and cloud services across every endpoint to expand usage and deepen engagement.
First-party content is key to our approach and we now have 11 game studios in our portfolio to deliver differentiated content for our fast-growing services like Game Pass. Xbox Live now has 57 million monthly active users and Mixer usage growth is accelerating. This loyal, high-value community is our strongest asset, creating expanding opportunity for monetization of first- and third-party games. Fortnite is a good example of that and all up, we are seeing record software and services revenue and engagement being driven on our platform.
Earlier this month, we announced Project xCloud, a breakthrough game streaming technology that puts gamers at the center of their gaming experience, enabling them to play games in high fidelity wherever and whenever they want on any device. And it will empower game developers to scale to hundreds of millions of new users across devices. It's early days, but I'm excited about our road map.
Across our businesses, we are accelerating innovation, picking the right secular trends, investing in large growing markets, many of which are still in their infancy. Additionally, every one of our solutions is reinforcing our core intelligent cloud and intelligent edge platform. Not only are we optimistic about the opportunity for us and for our customers, we also recognize our responsibility.
We were one of the first companies in the United States to require suppliers doing substantial business with us to provide paid time off for their employees. And this quarter we took a further step to ensure that these suppliers also provide their employees with paid parental leave. We're ensuring that our enterprise class security innovation not only helps our largest customers but also protects small businesses and consumers who are often the most vulnerable to attacks.
Finally, we are putting AI into the hands of change makers to address society's most pressing challenges with initiatives like AI for Humanitarian Action, which supports critical disaster recovery efforts around the world and more. This recognition of our broader responsibility coupled with our bold innovation makes me incredibly optimistic about our opportunity ahead.
With that, now I'll hand over to Amy, who will cover our financial results in detail and share our outlook and I look forward to rejoining you after for questions.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. This quarter revenue was $29.1 billion, up 19% and 18% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 18%. Operating income increased 29% and 28% in constant currency and earnings per share was $1.14, increasing 36% and 33% in constant currency, another quarter of double-digit revenue and operating income growth drove a record start to the fiscal year.
We saw strength across each of our segments with strong sales execution by our partners and sales teams. Customer demand for our hybrid and cloud offerings drove the quarter and we continued to benefit from favorable macroeconomic and IT spending trends.
Now to our commercial business. As a reminder, starting this quarter, the commercial portion of LinkedIn is included in these metrics. Our commercial revenue annuity mix increased 1 point year-over-year to 90%. Commercial unearned revenue was $27.3 billion, growing 22% and 21% in constant currency, in line with expectations.
On an expiry base that was roughly flat year-over-year, commercial bookings were better than expected and increased 15% and 16% in constant currency, benefiting from larger long-term Azure contracts, growth in Azure consumption overages and pay-as-you-go contracts and strength in on-premises revenue.
These contract types impact bookings, reported revenue and unearned revenue in different ways. Let me explain. First, under ASC 606, hybrid and on-premises offerings drive bookings growth and more in-period revenue recognition. Therefore, there's less impact on unearned revenue.
Second, growth in Azure consumption overages and pay-as-you-go contracts drive bookings growth and in-period revenue, but have little impact on unearned revenue. And finally, long-term Azure contracts drive significant bookings growth, but have a smaller impact on in-period revenue and unearned revenue. The inclusion of LinkedIn results was immaterial to the growth rates of commercial unearned and commercial bookings.
Commercial cloud revenue was $8.5 billion, growing 47% and 46% in constant currency with strong performance in the U.S., Western Europe and the UK. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage increased 4 points to 62%, driven again by significant improvement in Azure gross margin.
Company level, gross margin percentage was 66%, down slightly year-over-year, with sales mix shift to gaming and commercial cloud. FX increased overall company and Productivity and Business Processes revenue by 1 point, in line with guidance. The impact to Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing revenue was immaterial, 1 point less favorable than expected. FX impact was immaterial to COGS and operating expenses, about 1 point less favorable than expected. Even with that headwind, operating expenses grew 8%, in line with expectations.
Our engineering and sales capacity investments in large growing markets continue to deliver differentiated value for our customers, while generating material operating income leverage. This quarter, we increased operating margin nearly 3 points year-over-year.
Now to the segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $9.8 billion, increasing 19% and 18% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by both the on-premises and cloud businesses. Office commercial revenue grew 17% and 16% in constant currency, driven by continued Office 365 commercial growth and approximately 3 points of growth from increased demand ahead of a price increase with the launch of Office 2019.
Office 365 commercial revenue grew 36% and 35% in constant currency, with installed base expansion across all customer segments and ARPU growth as customers shift to E3 and E5 workloads. Office 365 commercial seats grew 29%, and in line with last quarter, benefited from strong performance of our Microsoft 365 academic offers.
Office consumer revenue increased 16% and 17% in constant currency, driven by growth in Office 365 subscription revenue and approximately 5 points of growth from increased channel demand ahead of a price increase with the launch of Office 2019. Office 365 consumer subscribers grew to 32.5 million.
Dynamics revenue grew 20%, including a few points from a greater mix of contracts with higher in-period recognition under ASC 606. Dynamics 365 grew 51% and 49% in constant currency. LinkedIn revenue increased 33% with strong execution across all businesses.
Segment gross margin dollars grew 18% and 17% in constant currency and gross margin percentage declined slightly year-over-year as cloud mix offset LinkedIn and Office 365 margin expansion. Operating expenses increased 7% and 8% in constant currency with ongoing investments in LinkedIn, cloud engineering and commercial sales capacity to support top-line growth. Operating income increased 29% and 27% in constant currency.
Revenue from Intelligent Cloud was $8.6 billion, increasing 24%, better than anticipated, driven by demand for our hybrid offerings. Server products and cloud services revenue grew 28%. Azure revenue increased 76%, in line with our expectations with strong growth across both consumption and per-user base businesses.
Our on-premises server business grew 10% and 9% in constant currency, driven by continued demand for premium versions and hybrid solutions, as well as increased demand ahead of Q2 price increases for certain versions of our server products.
Enterprise services revenue grew 6% as growth in Premier Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services was partially offset by a decline in custom support agreements for Windows Server 2003. Segment gross margin dollars increased 28% and 27% in constant currency.
Gross margin percentage increased year-over-year as material improvement in Azure gross margin percentage offset the growing mix of Azure IaaS and PaaS revenue. Operating expenses increased 19% and 20% in constant currency, driven by ongoing investments in cloud and AI engineering and commercial sales capacity. Operating income grew 37% and 35% in constant currency.
Now to more Personal Computing. Revenue was $10.7 billion, increasing 15% with significantly better than expected results in gaming. Gaming revenue increased 44% and 45% in constant currency with better than expected results across both software and services and hardware.
Xbox software and services revenue grew 36%, with continued strength from a third-party title. Xbox hardware revenue grew 94% and 96% in constant currency with earlier than expected sell-in of holiday hardware bundles.
In Windows, we saw healthy Windows 10 commercial deployments as the OEM ecosystem continued to benefit from customer demand for modern and secure software and hardware. OEM Pro revenue grew 8%, a few points ahead of the commercial PC market from a higher mix of premium licenses. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 12%.
In consumer, OEM non-Pro revenue declined 5%, below the consumer PC market with continued pressure in the entry-level price category. Inventory levels were within the normal range.
Search revenue ex-TAC increased 17%, driven by Bing rate growth and increased volume in U.S. and international markets. In Surface, revenue grew 14%, driven by Surface Book 2 and Surface Go.
Segment gross margin dollars grew 10% and gross margin percentage decreased due to sales mix to our lower-margin gaming business. Operating expenses declined 1%. As a result, operating income grew 23%.
Now back to our total company results. As expected, capital expenditures including financed leases were up sequentially to $4.3 billion, driven by ongoing investment to meet demand for our cloud services. Cash paid for property, plant and equipment was $3.6 billion. Free cash flow was $10.1 billion and decreased 2% year-over-year due to higher capital expenditures in support of our cloud business.
Cash flow from operations increased 10% year-over-year with strong cloud billings and collections, partially offset by our first annual TCJA payment of $1.5 billion. Excluding the TCJA payment, free cash flow grew 12% and operating cash flow grew 22%. Other income was $266 million, higher than anticipated, due to realized gains in the recording of mark-to-market gains under the new accounting rules for financial investments.
Our effective tax rate was 14%. As a reminder Q1 and Q3 rates are impacted by the volume of equity vest during those quarters. This Q1, the impact was a bit more than expected due to the movement of our share price within the quarter. And finally, in line with our continued commitment, we returned $6.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, an increase of 27% year-over-year.
Now let's turn to our outlook. Given that we expect the GitHub acquisition to close shortly, my commentary includes the full impact of the deal including purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related expenses based on our current understanding of the purchase price allocation and related deal accounting. We continue to expect the deal to be minimally dilutive to FY 2019 and FY 2020 EPS on a non-GAAP basis and accretive to FY 2020 operating income on a non-GAAP basis.
For Q2, first FX. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect no impact to revenue growth. FX should decrease COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 1 point.
Second, our commercial business. We expect another quarter of healthy performance with solid bookings growth. Commercial unearned revenue is expected to grow approximately 19% year-over-year even with the ongoing shift toward the cloud contracts discussed earlier. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage should continue to improve on a year-over-year basis though at a more moderated rate than prior years given the continued mix of revenue toward Azure consumption-based services. Margin improvement will continue to vary on a quarterly basis driven by revenue mix, seasonality and the timing of infrastructure spend.
Third, we expect ongoing year-over-year growth in capital expenditure as we support growing demand. Given infrastructure spend timing, Q2 CapEx should be roughly in line with Q1.
Now to our segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $9.95 billion and $10.15 billion. Office commercial and Dynamics should continue to exhibit double-digit growth, driven by strong cloud performance but with some moderation due to the on-premise drivers discussed earlier. Office consumer will see continued momentum in new subscribers but overall revenue growth will be negatively impacted as channel inventories normalize. LinkedIn revenue growth should remain healthy though on a stronger prior-year comparable.
For Intelligent Cloud, which includes GitHub, we expect revenue between $9.15 billion and $9.35 billion. In Azure, we expect healthy growth across our consumption and per-user base businesses though per-user services growth will moderate given the size of the installed base.
In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $12.8 billion and $13.2 billion. OEM Pro revenue growth should be in line with the commercial PC market. As a reminder, prior year comparables strengthened throughout the remainder of the year.
In Windows commercial products and cloud services, we expect continued strength, as well as the benefit of a low prior-year comparable. And for OEM non-Pro, we expect similar dynamics to Q1. In Surface, revenue growth should accelerate, with the impact of recently launched devices including Surface Pro 6 and Surface Laptop 2. Search ex-TAC results should be similar to Q1 with durable growth in rate and volume.
In gaming, we expect revenue growth to moderate due to a prior year comparable that included the launch of Xbox One X. Software and services growth should be similar to Q1, with continued benefit from a third-party title plus overall platform strength.
Now back to our company results. We expect COGS of $12.2 billion to $12.4 billion and operating expenses of $9.8 billion to $9.9 billion. Other income and expense should be approximately $50 million as interest income and investment gains are partially offset by interest expense. And finally we expect our Q2 effective tax rate to be slightly above the full year estimate of 17%.
Now a few comments on the fiscal year. First FX. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect a 1 point headwind to full-year revenue growth with any benefit in H1 offset in H2. FX should decrease COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 1 point.
Second, operating expenses. We remain unchanged in our commitment to invest in strategic priorities that are key to driving long-term value creation. With the addition of GitHub as a strategic priority, we now expect operating expenses to grow roughly 8%. Growth excluding GitHub is expected to be in line with our prior guidance of roughly 7%.
Third, on operating margin. Even with the full GAAP impact of GitHub purchase accounting now included in our guidance, we continue to expect our operating margin to be up slightly year-over-year. Margin leverage is a direct result of our focused investments in the right technology trends coupled with consistent execution.
For CapEx, we continue to expect the growth rate for the year to moderate even as we meet demand for our cloud services. Regarding the GitHub acquisition, we remain committed to an incremental share buyback beyond the normal quarterly pace, though it's expected to fully offset stock consideration issue in the transaction by the end of the fiscal year. And finally, we continue to expect the full year effective tax rate to be roughly 17% with quarterly variability.
And with that, Mike, let's go to Q&A.
[0JNPYG-E Michael Spencer]
Thanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Our first question is coming from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you very much for the question. Amy and Satya, if I look at your Intelligent Cloud segment, and in particular the server products and cloud services, those continue to defy gravity a little bit here. And I'm just wondering if you could just give us a sense of how much may be the pricing changes that went into effect at the beginning of the quarter that you're in now might have helped drive spending last quarter ahead of them going into effect. But also, can you share with us how the Azure Hybrid Benefit message might also be impacting Azure growth rates? Thank you.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Sure. Thanks Heather for the question. I'll start and then Amy you can add. I mean, I think what you're fundamentally seeing in that overall KPI is what I think are two major advantages we have. One is an architectural technology advantage around hybrid, right. So we don't think of hybrid as some stopgap as a move to the cloud. We think about it's the coming together of distributed computing where the cloud and the edge work together for not just the old workloads, but most importantly for new workloads. And that's where we are seeing some very significant good feedback loops and shaping even our future road map. And this is a place where we are leading.
The second thing, as you pointed out in your question, is we have a business model advantage. The Azure benefits are things both for Windows Server as well as for SQL which I think are very, very unique to us and you see that. So the combination of the technology advantage and the business model advantage is what I see in the results, whether it's the standalone Azure growth, which is what we expected and it's very strong and the server KPI is even stronger. So I think that's at least how I would answer that question.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And to your specific question, Heather, on the impact of some of the price increases that went into effect in Q2, I'd say it's a couple of points. So I would not sort of over-rotate on that topic. The overall number, even if you take a couple points off that 28% is a very good performance, that I believe to Satya's point, is the impact you've seen of the very aligned technology road map on the architecture plus a business model that matches it.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you very much.
Michael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Heather. Operator, we'll take the next question please.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Excellent. Thank you for taking the question and very nice quarter guys. I wanted to dig into capital efficiency here around your cloud assets a little bit. This quarter you talked about Azure gross margins coming in, sort of continuing to improve really nicely. CapEx came in. I mean the growth there is slowing a little bit. Can you talk to us about sort of what's kind of driving that? Is it sort of the move to higher-level services so you get like better pricing against the capital? Is this sort of you're just not sort of pouring down as much cement, if you will, in terms of database expansion? Is it like better productivity of the core sort of compute stuff? Like can you help us understand sort of how capital intensity is trending in that Azure in particular but more broadly in the cloud businesses?
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
It's a great question, Keith. I would say the way we think about our capital efficiency and I in fact added that even to my commentary this time, which is we're building this intelligent cloud, intelligent edge platform to span everything, not only the Azure business but also the future of game streaming to what we are doing at Microsoft 365 or Dynamics 365.
For the first time, what you see across Microsoft is really one platform which spans all of these businesses and all of the margin structures that are there represented in it. So that's where if you think about the thing that Amy and I focus a lot on is the capital efficiency end-to-end in that context versus getting caught up in even the capital efficiency as measured by any one of these individual pieces, because we think that's what Microsoft's uniqueness long term lies.
But that said on Azure, you're absolutely right. What you are seeing is two things. One is things like the Azure Hybrid Benefits as well as the higher-level services that create I think uniqueness both as well as good margins long term. I mean, especially on the database side is one place where I would say from a year-over-year worth of progress, whether it's just Azure database by itself. I mean that service with full compatibility with SQL Server is a fantastic value proposition for our customers who have huge estates whether it's the Data Warehouse that's become very, very competitive, the Data Lake. And Cosmos DB I think is very unique in its capability. So that's one place where as you know, any AI project first starts with data, and that's one place where we are seeing good traction.
Michael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Keith. Operator, we'll move to the next question.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Philip Winslow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Philip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey. Thanks, guys, for talking my question and congrats on another great quarter. I just wanted to focus in on Office. Obviously, Amy, you called out some of the positives from the price increase that's coming up. But if I look at just Office 365 both commercial and consumer, just continued just strong growth on both those two. And especially on the commercial side, there's still that gap between seat growth and revenue growth. So if you kind of just think where you are and I guess in terms of just sort of the life cycle here and obviously, we've got multiple SKUs, maybe just kind of give us an update of how you're sort of think about where you stand and then especially as you think about the full year here, how you sort of expect these metrics to progress?
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Sure. And I'm actually going to expand my comments a little bit because the sales motion is really broader than Office 365. The sales motion is really about Microsoft 365. And what that encompasses is both the Office 365 value proposition, but also our management and security value proposition with EMS as well as Advanced Threat Protection and Windows value that shows up in that Windows commercial services KPI.
So the bucket of those together, what we're seeing is many of the workloads and movement to E3 within Microsoft 365 and to E5 continue to have good pull. There's great customer demand for the value that comes in security and analytics, in meetings, in voice, in collab. And I think when you look at the value, I think we feel good about the opportunity to continue to move these users including new first-line or frontline users that we've not had access before.
We got room on user growth, which you continue to see that number go up across segments. And we've got room in ARPU, which you've continued to see us have. So in many ways your question shows itself in Office, but the trends are the same if you look at EMS growth or if you were to look at that Windows commercial growth number.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
And I'd just add that the seat growth as well as the ARPU growth, one of the things even in spite of the success we may have achieved in the past, we never were that successful in penetrating with all of our workloads when it comes to small business and definitely across the globe. So that's another dimension that you see play out as well.
Philip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Awesome. Thanks.
Michael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.
Great. Thanks, Phil. Yeah, thanks, Phil. Operator, we'll move to the next question please.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hey, thanks for taking it. Satya, can you focus on gaming for a little bit? With the xCloud you kind of announced something that the whole industry have kind of been dreaming about as like the Holy Grail where you want to go eventually have it all in the cloud, delivered from the cloud and subscription service. Can you talk a little bit about the innovation that is involved in you being able to starting to deliver that now? Thank you.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Sure. But before I get to streaming, the thing that I'll say is most critical when you think about gaming is having a platform where the gamers are already there. That means you need to have a platform that has a community around it and monetize as well.
So when you see some of the KPIs and some of the strength you saw in quarter, that's the foundation of Xbox. Xbox has the key gaming community and the monetization capabilities. Whether it's first-party games or third-party games, we are best-in-class in that monetization and that's what's reflected in the results.
So given that structural position, we are going to make sure that we keep increasing the strength of the community. You see that already with Minecraft going to all platforms and that increasing the intensity of the community and you'll see us do more of that. Obviously, bringing Game Pass to even the PC is going to be a big element of that.
And then streaming is just a natural sequence of it. And the advantage we have with streaming is, we have a massive cloud advantage. And so we're going to bring obviously what we're doing with Azure, Azure networking, all to bear in ensuring that Xbox and xCloud is one of the best workloads for it.
So that's how I see it. It, of course, will increase our reach, but what I am most excited about is the core content and community and the platform we have for monetizing that usage. And that I think is really what gives us even the permission to think about streaming.

Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Jennifer Lowe with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Jennifer Swanson Lowe - UBS Securities LLC
Great. Thank you. I know you mentioned GitHub is closing soon. It's obviously not closed yet. But given you've got a few months under your belt now since it was announced and an opportunity to solicit some feedback from the developer communities that maybe aren't using Microsoft technologies on a regular basis, but are very active with GitHub, do you have a sense yet of what the opportunities might be to do outreach to those developers that might be working closely with competing platforms? And how closely you can kind of hug them into the Microsoft ecosystem versus just leaving GitHub as sort of a self-sustaining entity now that you have a little bit more opportunities to discuss that with customers in the field?
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Sure. First of all, thank you for the question. We're very excited about GitHub closing. And quite frankly, primarily I'm excited because for us, as I've always said, GitHub is not a means to some other end. It's an end on to its own, which is, we've always cared about developer and developer productivity and especially at a time like this when there are more developers outside of the tech industry as the world goes digital.
We think this is perhaps one of the big SaaS opportunities going forward. And so therefore that's why we want to ensure that everything we do and the number one priority for Nat and team at GitHub will be all about maintaining that GitHub community, the ethos around developers at the core.
That said, I think we will do what is necessary to make sure that our products and services that are on Azure or elsewhere, our tooling, which are already many open source projects on GitHub, we do a good job of earning that developer trust and developer adoption. But we are very grounded in the fact that it has to be earned and not something that we will inherit because of being owners of GitHub.
The second thing I'll also mention is that, to me the opportunity to win, I would say, new class of developers, we are making progress. In fact, this morning I was reading a news article in Hacker News, which is a community where we have been working hard to make sure that Azure is growing in popularity. And I was pleasantly surprised to see that we have made a lot of progress, in some sense, that at least basically said that we are neck to neck with Amazon when it comes to even elite developers as represented in that community. So we have more work to do, but we're making progress on all dimensions.

Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Brad Alan Zelnick - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Thanks very much and congrats on a great start to the year. Amy, in your comments, you cited the continued benefit from a strong IT spending environment and it's very clear from your results there's a lot of Microsoft-specific success and execution happening here as well. But as you look at your pipelines and all the various signals you see in the market, do you have a view on how long the environment persists and what are the indicators that give you confidence?
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Brad, for the question. In general, the way I tend to look at this is the interactions we have with customers and the markets we're in and do we feel like they're expansive. And so, when I look at the businesses that we've built and the businesses we're investing in and do I feel like this needs for tech intensity that Satya talked about, that will ultimately drive the desire and need for customers to adopt technology, we're in the right places.
And that's the signal actually we hear back from customers, whether that is Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365 and a new worldview on what business processes and business applications can look like. Whether it's frankly our views on gaming that Satya just discussed, I feel like the signal we're hearing is that we're in the right part of the market with customer-focused value that can deliver a high ROI to them, no matter what that IT budget looks like. And so I think as long as we focus on providing that value, we'll feel good about our opportunity to both grow and take share in the market.

Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Walter H. Pritchard - Citi Investment Research (Europe)
Thanks. Amy, I'm wondering if you could talk about Azure, the outlook for the year. I know growth rate's been a bit volatile. I think you had a pretty strong Q4 including (45:02) that business. Maybe you could help us understand relative to the growth we're seeing right now how you expect the Azure trajectory to play out for the year?
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Sure. Let me spend a couple minutes on that. We actually saw better bookings in Q1 again on Azure, as I mentioned, just like we did in Q4. And so obviously that's certainly encouraging as we look on a go-forward basis for the rest of the year. But as I think about – I tend to focus as you know on the all-up server and product KPI because the Azure hybrid benefits that exist with Windows Server and SQL Server are really valuable to customers if they want to move to Azure on their own terms, is the single best value proposition to a customer to make a commitment there.
And so, if we start to focus on one number or the other, I think we're missing the fact that our customer method and go-to-market is actually through the overall product portfolio. And so, I tend to probably as you might imagine be more confident than I was in coming out of Q4 with a strong Q1 in that overall hybrid demand and Azure signal plus good Azure bookings when I talked about my confidence in high teens growth in that KPI for the rest of the year.
Walter H. Pritchard - Citi Investment Research (Europe)
Great. Thank you, Amy.
Michael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Walter. Operator we'll take the next question please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thank you, and I will add my congrats. Amy, last quarter you had mentioned that you could see increased volatility in time, in commercial bookings growth as you were talking about the commitments were increasing to larger and longer-term agreements. But this quarter, the ex-free portfolio was flattish and yet your commercial bookings grew 16%. I think presumably a very powerful performance with the renewals, the expansions and the new bookings, and I don't think you repeated that comment about bookings volatility in the same way. So I'm just curious, maybe could you help us connect the dots on that performance and also the potential for volatility in either direction going forward?
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Sure, thank you. That's a great question. You will see volatility in the bookings number for the reasons we've laid out before, the changing expiry base, but also large contracts and commitments done by Azure. And to your point, we actually saw it this quarter because we again saw a quite good performance in some of these larger long-term Azure contracts which added on a flat expiry base to that 15% bookings growth, which was good.
And so what that means is, you'll see some volatility in that and you're also going to see some volatility in commercial unearned, specifically because whenever you see hybrid strength, it won't land as much in unearned. So as the business gets bigger and we do bigger and larger deals and some of them are on-prem and some of them are in Azure, you're going to see volatility frankly in both of those.
But what I try to do is think about the impact of all the key data points which is how did we do in-quarter, how did we do on the unearned revenue on the balance sheet and how did we do in overall bookings. And if I triangulate between all those three, just like I did in Q4, I feel really good about our commercial performance.

Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks so much. Maybe two for Amy. Just first on that KPI of Azure plus server products, that high teens number was obviously a lot better this quarter. But is that still the framework for the year? And then actually on Windows, we've seen such elevated strength on the Pro side, I think because of the corporate Win 10 cycle. And I wondered if you could just, as we think about the back half of the current fiscal year and we come up against some tougher comps, I wondered if you could just help us sort of think through that and how we should think about the puts and takes on that refresh cycle? Thanks.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Sure. On the first question on the server and product KPI, obviously the strong performance this quarter gives me higher confidence in my commitment to high teens growth in that number. But I'll update that generally longer in the quarter and will give me through Q2 before I make a longer commitment.
And then separately on Windows 10 and the strength we've seen in OEM Pro, and I would also say it mirrors in some ways you're also going to see some of that growth and strength in Windows commercial, so let me answer them a bit together. The Windows 10 Pro strength and I think commercial strength we've seen, we continue to see good signs on the commercial refresh, really security, manageability of modern hardware and software together continues to be a good signal for us.
We continue to watch the end of support. It's really critical for us for customers to have a terrific experience as we upgrade them and ask them to move to Windows 10 with a lot of value. That end of support is about five quarters away, so we'll continue to expect good signal and good demand in that Pro segment. And it should, to your point, match increasingly the market and we do get to some slightly bigger comps in H2 which I would agree with.
But I don't want to diminish the signal because the signal is demand is very good for Windows 10 and upgrades in modern hardware when they realize the benefits. And so even if you have a tougher comp, I think the demand signal and our opportunity to continue to sell Microsoft 365 in that process and then upgrade to Office 365 as they do deployments is a big opportunity for us to excel.

Thank you. Our final question is coming from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
Brad Robert Reback - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay, thanks very much. Maybe one for Satya. Satya, as you think about the Dynamics business going forward, how do you weigh the potential need to do a larger acquisition there versus just organic development or small tuck-ins? Thanks.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Yeah. I mean overall, I feel very, very good about the opportunity ahead in business applications for us. And I think about the combination of both Dynamics 365 as well as what we're doing on the LinkedIn side. They all represent our participation in business applications. And the thing that I – what's happening out there in the marketplace is, as things become more digital, there is in fact more need for business process automation.
At the same time, there is a need for the application suite to be built very differently. And that's where I think we have an architectural advantage again with Dynamics 365. It's much more modular, it's modern, it's extensible with this power platform that gives us the ability to do things for customers and serve them in ways that is very differentiated. So that's our primary focus. We'll always look at opportunities outside. But in a time when there is a real fundamental shift in the category when it comes to both business models and technology, we feel we're well positioned to ride that.
Brad Robert Reback - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Great. Thanks very much.

Michael Spencer
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today.
On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer, Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer, Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer, and Carolyn Frantz, Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary.
On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today’s call and provides reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.
Unless otherwise specified, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the Company’s fourth-quarter performance in addition to the impact that these items and events had on the financial results.
All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency, when available, as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only.
We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today’s call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording.

During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today’s earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the risk factor section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Satya.
Satya Nadella
Thank you, Mike, and thanks to everyone on the phone for joining.
I’m proud of our strong results this quarter and even more proud of what we have accomplished over the last 12 months. We delivered more than $110 billion in revenue for the full year with double digit topline and bottom line growth. And our commercial cloud business surpassed more than $23 billion in revenue for the year with gross margin expanding to 57%. The strength of our results reflects accelerating innovation and the trust customers are placing in us to power their digital transformation.
I shared our vision for the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge a little over a year ago, a vision that is now quickly becoming reality and impacting every customer in every industry. Everything we have accomplished this year has been about accelerating our lead in this new era and the tremendous opportunity ahead. We focused on the right secular technology trends and growing markets and followed that up with solid roadmap execution.
We reorganized our engineering teams to break free of the categories of the past and better align with the emerging tech stack from silicon to AI to experiences, to better serve the needs of our customers today and long into the future. We reoriented our sales and marketing teams, adding industry and technical expertise to partner more deeply with our customers on their digital transformation journeys. And, most importantly, we drove innovation to deliver differentiated value across the cloud and the edge.
Now, I’ll briefly highlight some of our innovation and momentum. We introduced Microsoft 365 to empower employees in the modern workplace. Microsoft 365 is now a multi-billion-dollar business that gives our customers a path to the cloud and broadens our reach with new and underpenetrated markets, including more than 2 billion first-line workers, and industry-specific workflows.
Across Microsoft 365, we are helping people be more productive, collaborate and stay secure on any device with AI infused experiences they use every day, and it’s driving usage. We have more than 135 million users of Office 365 commercial. Outlook mobile is being used on more than 100 million iOS and Android devices. And more than 200,000 organizations are using Microsoft Teams as the hub for teamwork.
We invested to make Windows 10 the most modern, secure, always-up-to-date operating system. Windows 10 is now active on nearly 700 million devices, and the growth of the enterprise deployments this year exceeded our expectations.
It was a record year for LinkedIn, now with more than 575 million members and revenue growth of 37% in Q4, the fifth consecutive quarter of revenue acceleration. We saw record levels of engagement and job postings again this quarter, with sessions growth up 41% year-over-year. This strong engagement is driven by quality of the feed, video, messaging and acceleration of mobile usage, with mobile sessions up more than 55% year-over-year. We will continue to invest to make LinkedIn the essential platform to connect the world’s professionals and help them achieve more with experiences powered by LinkedIn and Microsoft graphs.
Dynamics 365 gives organizations an alternative to monolithic, siloed suites of business applications with modular, modern, extensible, and AI-driven apps that unlock insights across every part of the organization, from sales to HR. It’s gaining traction as our third commercial cloud growth engine, with revenue up 61% year-over-year. Our investments in Power BI, PowerApps and Flow as the new analytics and application platform are gaining significant momentum with ISVs and enterprise customers.
Azure is the only hyper scale cloud that extends to the edge across identity, data, application platform, security and management, and our differentiated architectural approach drove another strong quarter of growth. We are investing aggressively to build Azure as the world’s computer.
We expanded our global datacenter footprint to 54 regions, more than any other cloud provider, and with the most comprehensive compliance coverage in the industry. We added nearly 500 new Azure capabilities in the last year alone, focused on both existing workloads and new workloads such as IoT and AI at the Edge. We introduced Azure Stack and Azure Sphere, two first-of-their kind cloud-to-edge solutions that are already seeing strong customer demand.
We are democratizing data science and AI with Azure Cognitive Services, Azure ML, and data services such as Azure Cosmos DB to help organizations of all sizes convert their data into insights and experiences for competitive advantage. The world’s leading companies are running on Azure, and I’m especially proud that Walmart chose Azure and Microsoft 365 to accelerate its digital transformation for their associates and customers.
In Gaming, we are pursuing our expansive opportunity from the way games are created and distributed to how they are played and viewed, surpassing $10 billion in revenue this year for the first time. We are investing aggressively in content, community and cloud services across every endpoint to expand usage and deepen engagement with gamers. The combination of Xbox Live, Game Pass subscriptions and Mixer are driving record levels of growth and engagement.
Not only are we investing to grow organically but we are also investing inorganically in opportunities that expand our total addressable market and accrue value to our platforms and our customers. Take LinkedIn. We have united the world’s leading professional cloud with the world’s leading professional network and proved that we have an integration model that works, enabling LinkedIn to accelerate growth while retaining its member-first ethos.
With GitHub, we recognized the increasingly vital role that developers play in value creation and growth in the era of the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge. Our pending acquisition will enable us to bring our tools and services to new audiences, while enabling GitHub to grow and retain its independence and developer-first ethos and community.
PlayFab accelerates our vision to build a world-class cloud platform for the gaming industry across mobile, PC and console. And the addition of five new gaming studios bolsters our first-party content development to support our fast-growing gaming services.
Microsoft has always been a partner-led company, and partners increasingly see more opportunity on our platforms, inspiring leading companies like SAP, Adobe and GE, as well as fast-growing start-ups like InMobi to play an even larger role in our vibrant and growing partner ecosystem, an asset that gives us scale in this new era.
In closing, our opportunity has never been greater. We will continue to innovate and invest across our solution areas in serving our customers and their unmet and unarticulated needs. With this tremendous opportunity comes great responsibility. We’re relentlessly working to instill trust in technology across everything we do. It’s why we will continue to lead the industry dialogue on trust, advocate for customer privacy, drive industry-wide cybersecurity initiatives, and champion ethical AI.
Our investments and business model are fundamentally aligned with our customers’ long-term interests and success. This opportunity and responsibility grounds us in our mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. I’m proud of our progress, and I’m proud of the more than 100,000 Microsoft employees around the world who are focused on our customers’ success in this new era.
Now, I’ll hand it over to Amy who will cover our financial results in detail and share our outlook. And I look forward to rejoining you for the questions.
Amy Hood
Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone.
This quarter, revenue was $30.1 billion, up 17% and 15% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 19% and 16% in constant currency. Operating income increased 30% and 24% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $1.13, increasing 7% and 3% in constant currency. As a reminder, FY17 included a $1.8 billion tax benefit related to previously non-deductible phone losses.
In our largest quarter of the year, our sales teams and partners delivered exceptional commercial results. We saw strong performance in most of our geographic regions against a backdrop of favorable macroeconomic conditions and positive IT spending trends.
Customer commitment to our cloud platform continues to increase. In FY18, we closed a record number of multi-million-dollar commercial cloud agreements and more than doubled the number of $10 million-plus Azure agreements. Our annuity mix increased 3 points year-over-year to 89%. As a result, commercial bookings increased 18% even with a strong prior year comparable. Commercial unearned revenue was $29 billion, growing 23% and 21% in constant currency, significantly higher than anticipated due to stronger than expected cloud billings.
Our commercial cloud revenue was $6.9 billion, growing 53% and 50% in constant currency with strong performance across the U.S., Western Europe, and the UK. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage increased 6 points to 58%. In line with our commitment at the beginning of the year, we improved the gross margin percentage in each cloud service, with Azure seeing the most significant improvement.
Our company gross margin percentage was 68%, ahead of our expectations, and up 1 point year-over-year from improvement in our More Personal Computing segment, driven by Surface.
FX increased revenue growth by 2 points, 1 point lower than anticipated, due to a stronger U.S. dollar. At the segment level, FX had a positive impact of 3 points on Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and 1 point on More Personal Computing revenue. The FX impact to COGS was immaterial.
This quarter, operating expenses grew 9% and 8% in constant currency, above our expectations due to revenue driven expense, such as sales compensation given the strength of the quarter, and severance expense, primarily in our sales organizations, offset by FX favorability. Strong revenue growth, improved device gross margin percentage, and continued targeted investment in cloud engineering, cloud sales capacity, and LinkedIn created operating income leverage. This quarter, operating income increased again, up 3 points year-over-year.
Now, to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $9.7 billion, increasing 13% and 10% in constant currency, in line with our expectations even with the headwinds from a stronger dollar and a higher than anticipated mix of cloud billings in our Office commercial and Dynamics businesses during the quarter. As a reminder, under ASC 606, cloud revenue is ratably recognized while annuity on-premises revenue has a component of upfront recognition. A higher mix of cloud billings is reflected in more unearned revenue and less in-period recognition in a quarter.
Office commercial revenue increased 10% and 8% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue grew 38% and 35% in constant currency and Office 365 commercial seats grew 29%. We continued to see healthy installed base growth and ARPU expansion from customer adoption of premium workloads in E3 and E5. Office consumer revenue increased 8% and 6% in constant currency, driven by recurring subscription revenue and growth in the subscriber base, now at 31.4 million.
Our Dynamics business grew 11% and 8% in constant currency, with double digit billings growth. Dynamics 365 grew 61% and 56% in constant currency.
LinkedIn revenue grew 37% and 34% in constant currency with strong execution across all businesses. As Satya highlighted, engagement continued to accelerate, and we also saw record levels of job postings, benefitting from a robust U.S. job market.
Segment gross margin dollars grew 13% and 10% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged year-over-year even as cloud mix increased, driven by margin expansion in Office 365 and LinkedIn.
Operating expenses increased 7% as we continued to invest in LinkedIn, cloud engineering, and commercial sales capacity. Operating income increased 20% and 13% in constant currency.
Revenue from the Intelligent Cloud segment was $9.6 billion, increasing 23% and 20% in constant currency, with better than expected results in both our on-premises and Azure businesses. Server products and cloud services revenue increased 26% and 24% in constant currency, driven by continued strong Azure revenue growth of 89% and 85% in constant currency. Azure per user services performed ahead of expectations with our Enterprise Mobility installed base growing 55% year-over-year to over 82 million. Our on-premises server business grew 8% and 6% in constant currency, with double digit growth in premium server products revenue and healthy renewals, benefiting from the significant value customers see in our hybrid solutions.
Enterprise Services revenue grew 8% and 7% in constant currency, as growth in Premier Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services was partially offset by a decline in custom support agreements for Windows Server 2003.
Segment gross margin dollars increased 23% and 20% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged as material improvement in the Azure gross margin percentage was offset by a growing mix of Azure IaaS and PaaS revenue. Operating expenses increased 11% with ongoing investments in cloud engineering and sales capacity to support top-line growth. Operating income grew 34%, up 30% in constant currency.
Finally, More Personal Computing. Revenue was $10.8 billion, up 17% and 16% in constant currency, with better than expected results in Windows commercial, OEM Pro, and Surface.
In the commercial space, we saw an accelerating pace of Windows 10 enterprise deployments this quarter. Customer demand for modern and secure hardware and stronger than expected PC growth in geographies where Pro mix is high contributed to OEM revenue growth of 14%, ahead of the overall commercial market. Windows commercial products and cloud services grew 23% and 19% in constant currency, driven by double digit billings growth as well as a higher mix of in-quarter recognition from multi-year agreements.
In consumer, OEM Non-Pro revenue declined 3%, slightly below the consumer PC market, driven by continued pressure in entry-level price category, even as we continued to take share in the premium category. Inventory levels were within the normal range.
Search revenue ex-TAC increased17% and 16% in constant currency driven by enhancements to our advertising platform and Bing volume growth across both U.S/ and international markets. Surface revenue increased 25% and 21% in constant currency, driven by strong performance of the latest editions in the portfolio against a low prior year comparable.
In Gaming, revenue grew 39% and 38% in constant currency. Xbox software and services grew 36% and 35% in constant currency, mainly from a third-party title. Xbox Live monthly active users increased 8% to 57 million. Segment gross margin dollars grew 21% and 18% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage increased driven by new Surface editions, offset by sales mix to lower margin businesses.
Operating expenses grew 9% and 8% in constant currency, driven by seasonality changes in advertising spend versus the prior year and investments in engineering across Search and AI. Operating income grew 38% and 32% in constant currency.
Now, back to total Company results. Capital expenditures including finance leases were $4.1 billion and increased on a sequential basis, in line with expectations. Cash paid for property, plant, and equipment was $4 billion, reflecting investments to support growth in our cloud business as well as a $250 million real estate acquisition.
Free cash flow was $7.4 billion and down 15% year-over-year, reflecting higher capital expenditures in support of our cloud business. Cash flow from operations grew 4% year-over-year and included tax payments related to the adoption of ASC 606 and TCJA, as well as an earlier start to the hardware inventory build for holiday than in the prior year. Excluding the impact of these items, operating cash flow grew approximately 13%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections.
Other income and expense was approximately $300 million, lower than expected due to FX re-measurement. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 18%, higher than anticipated due to the geographic mix of our revenue. And finally, we returned $5.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, an increase of 16%. Our Q4 share repurchase was $2.1 billion, up 31% year-over-year, but down sequentially, given the suspension of share repurchase activity in advance of the announced GitHub acquisition.
Now, let’s move to the outlook. My commentary, for both the full year and next quarter, does not include any impact from GitHub which we still expect to close by the end of the calendar year. Overall, the key drivers and trends of our business for the next fiscal year remain largely unchanged from April and assume a consistent macro environment.
First, on FX. Assuming that rates remain stable, we expect no impact to full year revenue growth, with any FX benefit in H1 offset in H2. FX should decrease COGS and operating expense growth by 1 point. Second, our commercial business. Given corporate IT spend optimism, an increasing demand for cloud services, our strong competitive product position, and consistent sales execution, we expect another year of strong revenue growth and higher annuity mix across our commercial business. As customer commitment to our cloud increases, we are seeing larger and longer term agreements. As a result, we may see increased quarterly volatility in commercial bookings growth and commercial unearned revenue.
Productivity and Business Processes should continue to grow double digits driven by Office 365, Dynamics 365, and LinkedIn. Customer demand for our hybrid offerings should drive high-teens growth in our server products and cloud services revenue KPI. And in Azure specifically, we expect an increasing mix of IaaS and PaaS consumption-based revenue. In Windows, we expect strong business fundamentals in our OEM Pro and Windows commercial businesses, though the rates of revenue growth will slow through the year against a strong FY18 comparable.
Third, commercial cloud gross margin percentage. We expect continued improvement in each commercial cloud service, as well as in the overall commercial cloud gross margin percentage. The rate of improvement will moderate relative to FY18 as revenue mix continues to shift to Azure IaaS and PaaS consumption-based services, and we realize less year-over-year improvement in our per-user services.
We will continue to increase our investments in CapEx to meet the growing demand for our cloud services, although we do expect the growth rate for the year to moderate.
Next, operating expenses. Given our strong execution, we will continue to invest in the trends and growing markets we believe are fundamental to long-term shareholder value creation. Investment in commercial cloud, LinkedIn, gaming, and AI should result in operating expense growth of roughly 7%. Even with these strategic investments and the continued shift to our cloud businesses, we expect operating margin to be up slightly year-over-year.
Other income and expense should be slightly negative, in line with prior guidance, and with quarterly variability primarily due to changes in FX remeasurement, interest rates, and valuation changes with the adoption of the new accounting rules for financial investments.
And finally, tax rate. We’ve refined our estimates of the impacts from TCJA, the mix of service versus license revenue, and the geographic mix of revenue and now expect our FY19 effective tax rate to be roughly 17% with quarterly variability.
Now, to the outlook for our first quarter. First, FX. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by approximately 1 point and decrease COGS and operating expenses by 1 point. Second, our commercial business. We expect another healthy quarter with commercial unearned revenue down approximately 10% sequentially, in line with historic seasonality. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage will improve slightly on a sequential basis. Third, we expect another quarter of sequential growth in capital expenditures as we continue to support growing, global customer demand.
Now to the segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $9.25 billion and $9.45 billion, driven by double digit growth in Office Commercial and Dynamics. LinkedIn revenue growth should remain high on a stronger prior year comparable. In Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $8.15 billion and $8.35 billion. Azure revenue growth should reflect a balance of continued strength in our IaaS and PaaS consumption-based services and a moderating rate of growth in our per-user services. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $9.95 billion to $10.25 billion. In OEM Pro, we expect revenue growth in line with the commercial PC market. And in OEM non-Pro, we expect similar dynamics as seen in Q4.
In Surface, we continue to expect strong performance from our latest editions, including the new Surface Go, to drive growth similar to Q1 of the prior year. Search ex-TAC should see another quarter of mid-teens growth with consistent execution against rate and volume growth opportunities. In Gaming, we expect mid-teens revenue growth with continued strong user engagement on our platform. The software and services growth rate will moderate due to strong third-party titles launched a year ago. We expect COGS of $9.5 billion to $9.7 billion and operating expenses of $9.2 billion to $9.3 billion. Other income and expense is expected to be approximately negative $100 million. And finally, we expect our Q1 effective tax rate to be slightly lower than our full year rate due to the volume of equity vests that take place during our first quarter.
Mike, let’s go to Q&A.
Michael Spencer
Thanks, Amy. We’ll now move to Q&A. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we’ll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Keith Weiss
Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. And congratulations on a really nice quarter. I wanted to dig into Azure a little bit. I think growth overall in Azure this quarter is probably ahead of most peoples’ expectations. And it sounds like the type of business that’s being done on Azure is becoming more strategic and changing a little bit. So, Satya, I was hoping you could talk to us a little bit about the types of workloads, the type of sort of services that are being used on Azure, how that’s evolved over the past year. And Amy, for you, maybe there is a new KPI, I believe. You gave us sort of the growth in the Enterprise Mobility of 55%. Was that in line with your expectations? Because I know you were sort of tempering our expectations on growth in that part of the business. Is that growing in line with kind of the slowdown you were expecting or is that better than you had imagined?
Satya Nadella
Yes. So, let me -- first of all thanks Keith for the question. And so, let me start. Overall, in terms of the workload mix, it’s been fairly stable, which is our hybrid value proposition really has continued to resonate. So, that means there’s a bunch of workloads that are migrating to the cloud, people use both Azure Stack plus Azure. So, that continues to drive a lot of IaaS growth for us as people are sort of looking basically to lift and shift a lot of their current data center workloads. Then, on top of it, we even have modernization of apps that is accelerating. And that drives a lot of the higher level services, in particular our data services as well as our AI services when AI services are essentially compute, but what happens is all this compute then requires storage and data, and that’s another place where we see increasing acceleration.
The one thing that I would say that I am increasingly seeing is Tier 1 workloads. In some sense, when you think about some of the commitments being made by some of the biggest brands in the world in terms of what they’re doing, one, it’s very core to their operation; and two, they are running it in the cloud. And so, that’s one thing that definitely is a market difference for us.
Amy Hood
And to your question on the per user services, specifically Enterprise Mobility, Keith, it was a bit better than I had anticipated in Q4. And really, driver of these per user services, such as EMS, actually is the value proposition that Satya refers to, and we refer to as Microsoft 365 and we saw strength broadly. And if you think about that, it’s the Windows commercial, it’s Office 365 commercial and EMS. And really that I think what we heard a lot was the value of the security and management continue to add more supported endpoints, offer really tremendous value to customers. And we did see a bit more strength than I was anticipating in Q4.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Karl Keirstead
Amy, the commercial unearned revenue and bookings were again super strong, and evidently Microsoft is benefiting from fairly strong EA renewal activity. So, when you look out into fiscal ‘19, how would you compare the degree of renewal activity versus fiscal ‘18 and fiscal ‘17? It sounds like you’re still constructive, but I’d love to hear some color whether it feels as good as the fiscal year you just ended? Thank you.
Amy Hood
Thanks, Karl. Let me break up that question a little bit, because you actually asked a couple of things that are important. Number one, the unearned strength that we saw at the end of Q4, you’re right, was very good execution on renewals on a reasonably large renewal base. But, there was also very good execution of adding new workloads, adding new opportunity in Q4, things such as Azure, as an example or Dynamics 365, as an example. So, really Q4 wasn’t just renewal activity, it was also new workloads and new value. So, when you look into ‘19, I am optimistic on both of those fronts, good execution continuing on renewals as well as adding new value, new opportunity. And the third component of the question was really how did the renewal base correlate FY18? And the answer is, it’s a little bigger, but it actually has the same amount of volatility quarter-to-quarter, so Q1 renewal base is actually almost equivalent to last year.
Operator
The next question is coming from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Heather Bellini
I was wondering, Amy or Satya, if you can help us think about how Azure Hybrid Benefit has changed the type of net expansion rate, you are experiencing on your ELAs that come up for renewal? And I know you are kind of a little bit touching on that with Karl, but is there any way to help to think about how that in particular might be helping the expansion rates of those accounts? And can you help us to think about how this might be -- how that might be helping drive growth in your existing contracts? And then the other question would be. You've mentioned that you are moving some per user consumption that you are going to see more growth in consumption based services versus per user Azure workload growth. And I’m just kind of wondering, if you could share with us, is there any gross margin impact there? Does one have higher gross margins than the other? Is there anything that we should be taking from how you are parsing those comments about how we think of Azure's gross margin progression going forward?
Satya Nadella
So, on the first one, I actually think that these hybrid used benefits are being sort of best kept secrets. So, I’m actually hoping that going into this next fiscal year, we do a much better job and customers do a much better job, but they don’t benefit because the advantage Azure has because of the hybrid used benefits across the entire workload are pretty phenomenal, and we had a good set of sessions at our partner meetings this week just really making sure that everybody understand those benefits. So, I don’t think that, that is really played out. If anything, all the growth we have seen is in spite of that not being broadly revenue driving growth.
But to your second question I’ll even say the following which is that, I think that there is clearly difference in GM between the per user and consumption. But the key is even the consumption services come in different forms, there is the IR services, there is the data services, and some of the higher level services. Some of these IoT services now even have SaaS components to it. So, therefore, I think that the mix will be different by quarter-by-quarter, but increasingly our strategy is in many times to get our customers to get going with what is core storage or core compute, but then they scale into these higher levels of services.
Amy Hood
And I’d say, Heather, the two components just to add. The Azure has a benefit. I think we are starting, as Satya said, we started to see some impact from that in my opinion in Q4 in the on-prem KPI. But it really was more in Windows. And the value as we continue to see in SQL next year I do think there is some opportunity for customers to realize the real value from these hybrid benefits. And so -- as to add confidence to my high teens KPI growth for the year is that this is a very customer value oriented offer.
To your question on GM, Satya has obviously correct on that one. And I’d say the way we think about it is actually more -- we're talking about Azure per user, it really does move more with M365 per user. It's almost better to put that in your mind as behaving more and having more structures more like Office 365 and behaves quite similarly; tends to have good quarters, when we do good execution on Office 365, and so my comments were more and continue to be around having people understand that sales motion, and that it tends to move in that direction.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.
Mark Moerdler
So, I’ve two related questions. And the first is, if you look at this quarter, the intelligent cloud revenue grew 23% and the gross margin dollars grew the same 23%, given the SaaS growing lower margin Azure business, we’re not seeing any longer negative margin impact. Have you reached the point where the incremental dollar for Azure revenue is closed to the overall intelligent cloud margin? And then a second, apologize, a slightly long question. CapEx spending in the quarter and the full year were both strong. We could argue the possibilities here, it’s driven by all the capacity of the demand or you having to spend a lot of it on replacing equipment as they’re ageing out. How should we think about the mix in CapEx between building demand and replacing with there?
Amy Hood
Let me take both of those. On the first one, in terms of the GM this quarter, you're right. The improvements particularly in the IaaS and PaaS, gross margin of Azure did offset the cloud mix to Azure within the segment, going forward continuing to see that. I think looking more pressured on gross margin just because the amount of Azure in the mix at the rate is growing, we’re still not at that point where a $1 of gross margin in the cloud is equivalent to a $1 on-prem. That being said, we’ve a lot as you saw this quarter room to grow gross margin dollars, in that even within that frame going into FY’19.
On your second question in terms of capital spent, if you think about it at a high level, our capital expenditures are growing at a lower rate than our overall cloud revenue is growing, and that’s why we’re starting to see leverage, right, flow through the P&L. And I think that the rate of CapEx growth, as I said in FY’19 will moderate, that happens because of course we’re doing some replacement overall. We're adding regions and seeing a lot of global demand, and so -- and improving margin, so I think that’s clearly the very high level as you asked the question. I tend to think revenue is growing faster than the capital. You’re seeing leverage through the P&L and we’ll see a moderating rate in FY’19 even if Q1 is the big quarter. It’s just going to be volatile as CapEx tends to be quarter-to-quarter based on both supply chain and demand.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed.
Walter Pritchard
Amy, wondering on the Office side, product and services on the commercial side, you had I think 8% growth. The lowest you’ve seen, I know 606 drive some volatility in that business. Could you help us understand, what drove that in the quarter? And I know you’re making some changes like this support and so forth as you get into the out years. Is there any impact that you expect to the gross rate in that businesses as we look forward from those changes?
Amy Hood
The entire impact in that KPI, I actually feel very good about that number because if you think about the $1 billion plus beat we had for the unearned, it was due to the fact that we had very good mix shift Office 365 in terms of billings in the quarter, almost very little of that gets recognized in quarter. Now, this all goes to the balance sheet. So, my confidence for FY19 in that number being the double digits we talked about in the full year guide, only gets raised by seeing that execution. So, it is really 606 related, if the way to think about it plus a mix of billings and billing strength. So, I don’t really think of that as being negative, and you saw the exact same behavior and dynamics. So, it's a pretty similar in period in quarter impact.
Operator
The next question is coming from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Phil Winslow
Amy, question for you. You've commented on the positive spread that you're seeing in the Windows OEM business, both overall, but particularly on the commercial side. When you start to think forward in the next, call it, couple of quarters, here obviously, you told us what the positive drivers were. But how do you see this playing out? And can we maintain that positive spread? And if so, why, and if it does maybe narrow sort of how do you think about the narrowing?
Amy Hood
So, let me frame it first as this thing that I and we're are seeing really customers driven, which is, if you started Windows 10 and the value the customers seek. And what we're seeing is accelerating enterprise deployment of Windows 10. When that happens, it does create demand for new devices and modern devices that improved security. So that then in turn results in a better and stronger overall OEM PC commercial market. In addition because of the macroeconomic conditions are actually quite good on this front and with the business optimism creating some wind at our back, I also think people look and say if security and value are important, this is a great time to invest in modern PCs. And particular in market where pro mix has been strong, I continue to expect to see all of those things happen, through the course of next year.
Now, what you will see however, if all those things even do remain true which I expect them to, if the economic environment stays the same. H2 where we've had really strong revenue growth and a really strong market will I think moderate growth wise, just because the base it was coming off in '17 was just a lot lower. So, even if I see all the good things and good trends happening that I feel really create a great opportunity for us to sell Microsoft 365, you will see growth rates moderate next year.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Lionel Renshaw with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Lionel Renshaw
Amy, can I go back to the server product, you partly answered it with the whenever ask and I believe hybrid cloud will be a factor here, but the growth was the best we've seen for a long time. Can you just talk about the drivers that kind of were at play here?
Amy Hood
You're right. The first one was the benefit that we saw from hybrid, in particular, with an outsized impact on Windows Server. The second has been a trend we also talked about a little before. We saw a strong double-digit growth in premium. So, it was mix shift as well as I think strikes in the hybrid benefits as a value across the customers, those two would have otherwise I’d actually call out as drivers for the quarter.
Lionel Renshaw
I mean they should be relatively sustainable, if I listen to them to you?
Amy Hood
I believe the one -- I think really important thing for us is continuing to focus on creating customer value. The concept of adding a lot of value by having and giving comfort to the customers that as they make a commitment to the Microsoft platform that they can move between a commitment to on-prem to the cloud in a high value way, I do believe is a unique thing that we offer at this time.
Operator
The next question is coming from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Q - Gregg Moskowitz
Satya, this is more of a big picture question, but over a longer term period, I am curios how large you think edge computing will become relative to centralized cloud computing?
Satya Nadella
Yes, I think vision that we have always had is that distributed computing in some sense will remain distributed. So, we don’t split this into, there is an edge computing, there is a cloud computing. The need for computing is on the secular basis going to increase. And as you need to reason over larger amounts of data, you need not only storage and compute to be co-located all over as the world get them embedded with computing, that’s what we are building for.
So if you think about our real competitive advantage and differentiation is, we have one programming model, one identity model, security, management. So that modern developers as well as IT can use the compute available from Azure Sphere to Azure. And the reality is these modern workloads in fact lose it all.
So it's not like I just build and Azure Sphere application. I build and application that’s fundamentally distributed that also happens to ransom and compute on Azure Sphere. That I think the future which is distributed computing going back to what needs to be truly distributed, even driven server-less even versus this thing about let's just have one-time migration to something new.
Operator
Our next question is coming from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Please proceed with your question.
Keith Bachman
Satya, I wanted to direct this to you, if I could. I’d like to understand how you view dynamics current positioning compared to the market opportunities? And the context of the question is, dynamics remains a fairly small part of Microsoft revenues as well if you look at the market share of where dynamic serve, it's a fairly small part of the markets served. So, what do you think Microsoft needs to do to have a larger impact against the market opportunities?
Satya Nadella
Overall, we are very committed and very bullish about the opportunity in dynamics. With Dynamics 365 for example, what you even to see in this last fiscal year which has been the first full fiscal year where we have this modern, modular approach to business application. I think it's very disruptive in the market place because it brings a very different value proposition. It has a price advantage and the value advantage for customers. And in it what is fundamentally fragmented mark, this is not a business application never was and never will be a winner-take-all. I know folks think about it best state, it’s not I mean it’s about one small category in one segment called enterprise.
There’s a share -- high share consider it 25%, 35% of what have you. So in some sense, this one has always been about being able to serve customers especially in an increasing digitization work, right, which is the need for more business process automation is increasing. Take an IoT project, translate into a preventive maintenance in Azure and then ends up as fields service and Dynamics, that’s been one pattern and we’ve seen a ton of traction with. So to me us going in fact to these new secular growth opportunities while being disruptive to the status quo of anyone who has high margins and very high price monolithic products today is basically our strategy going forward.
Operator
Thank you. Our final is coming from the line of Mark Murphy with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.
Mark Murphy
So, Amy, we keep expecting the Office 365 commercial seat growth to decelerate materially at some point, based upon the penetration level. But this quarter that seat growth actually accelerated about a 1 point to 29%. And when we look back on it the trajectory really isn’t too different than where it was even a year ago. So I was just curious, is there some underlying driver there that would keep that deceleration relatively manageable going forward? Or what you continue to see that flowing in a way that overtime would exert a little drag on Azure through this per user Azure services?
Amy Hood
This is one where overtime there’s certainly is going to be a deceleration. This is a per user business. And 365 has that characteristic and Office has it, EMS has it, and so this quarter actually what we saw, was actually some strength in education was added a good amount seats this quarter as well as good execution across our other segments. And so, we did see a bit of growth that we were excited to see frankly on a segment where we’ve been working hard to make additional progress and add value. The team has actually done nice job in that segment, created some really modern offers, to get back and to enhance market that as well.
But over the long term and as we continue to move aggressively, we will continue to seek growth dissipate, but I would also say this is going to take longer than I think many people would have thought, there’re lots of users as we continue to redefine what Office is that you add to the base. Whether that's first client workers, whether that’s an increasing number of small businesses who finally have access and value that we’re creating for them across things from scheduling all the way to being able to work through minor business process adjustments like Satya has talked about. So, really as we continue to redefine what Office means from something that people will always associate with Word, Excel and PowerPoint, to things that mean in mobile or video would stream, or collaboration with teams, I think we have opportunity to continue to add those new users, new types of users that we haven’t had access before and the capability even to users we have.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Thank you, Mike, and thanks to everyone on the phone for joining. It was another strong quarter, the result of picking the right secular trends, delivering differentiated innovation and focused execution that results in increased engagement and usage. The intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge era is already upon us. It represents a tremendous opportunity. We took significant steps this quarter to put this at the forefront of everything we do, realigning our entire engineering organization to accelerate innovation and better serve the needs of customers and partners.
With that as a backdrop, I want to highlight key areas of innovation and growth across our customer solutions. Creating a modern workplace where people can do their best work requires the right culture and the right technology. Microsoft 365 helps every organization empower their employees with AI-backed tools that unlock creativity, increase teamwork and fuel innovation, all the while ensuring compliance and protecting data from new cyber threats.
Microsoft is a clear leader in cloud security. Advanced AI reasons over hundreds of billions of signals each month to identify anomalies, automate detection and help customers respond to cyber threats. Just last week, we announced new value for customers, Microsoft Secure Score, Attack Simulator and Windows Defender ATP automatic detection and remediation capabilities, as well as a new open API for the Intelligent Security Graph.
We've also built compliance capability directly into our cloud services. Thousands of organizations are using the recently launched Compliance Manager with new information protection scanner and built-in classification capability to help prepare for GDPR. Our comprehensive approach and proactive protection are one reason Coca-Cola chose Microsoft cloud for their digital transformation.
One year in, Teams has rapidly become the hub for teamwork. More than 200,000 organizations in 181 markets use Teams from Maersk to General Motors. Teams is now enabled for a broad spectrum of calling and meeting room devices. We're also building AI-powered services into Teams. We've integrated Microsoft Stream, our enterprise video service, into Teams for transcription and time coding of recorded meetings.
We've added new facial recognition capabilities, which will attribute remarks to specific meeting attendees. And we are adding new Cortana capability to make calls, join a meeting or initiate three-way calling just using your voice.
All this innovation is driving customer usage. Windows 10 continues to gain traction in the enterprise, with Windows 10 commercial monthly active devices up 79% year-over-year. Office 365 commercial now has more than 135 million monthly active users, and Office 365 consumer subscribers increased to 30.6 million.
Now I'll turn to LinkedIn and business applications. From the start, we recognized the opportunity for LinkedIn and Microsoft to combine forces to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce and enable professionals to be more productive and successful. A little over one year in, we feel great about the value we are delivering for members, customers and shareholders
Our integration model has enabled LinkedIn to accelerate growth, while retaining its member-first ethos. Results are ahead of expectations across all lines of business with revenue growth of 37% year-over-year. We saw record levels of engagement again this quarter with sessions growth of more than 30% year-over-year, driven by innovation across the platform. This increased engagement is driving strong demand for sponsored content and marketing solutions and record levels of job postings and job visitors again this quarter in Talent Solutions.
Shifting to business applications. Dynamics 365 is gaining traction as our third commercial cloud growth engine, up 65% this quarter. We unleashed a wave of AI innovation in Dynamics with hundreds of new capabilities to transform sales and automate marketing, with Office 365 embedded inside Dynamics for productivity.
Relationship analytics for sales and marketing leverage the Microsoft Graph and data from social networks to improve customer relationships, and predictive lead scoring helps sellers identify and focus on high-quality leads.
We're investing in our business applications platform capabilities across Power BI, PowerApps, Flow and a common data model. Now customers can extend Dynamics 365 and Office 365 and quickly build applications using data from across the organization as well as third-party data with minimal custom code.
The new power platform enables customers like Inter Cars, a leading European auto parts company, to go from paper to digitized workflows within days versus months. With the rapid growth of Power BI, we are now the leader in business analytics in the cloud.
Now I'll turn to infrastructure and AI platforms. Our architectural advantage of a consistent stack from the cloud to the edge is resonating with customers, with Azure revenue growth of 93% this quarter. Recent CIO surveys affirm our leadership position in hybrid, developer productivity, trusted security and compliance and new workloads such as IoT and AI at the edge.
We have made the right investment decisions and they're having an impact, increasing our overall share in an expanding market. Our recent data center expansion, including the United Arab Emirates and Switzerland, brings our total number of regions to 50, more than any other cloud provider, and the additional availability zones provide the most comprehensive resiliency in the industry.
We also continue to see strong customer demand for Azure Stack across industries, and its unlocking new workload scenarios across hybrid and edge. Industrial IoT is transforming the rules of manufacturing, fueling cloud and edge innovation, accelerating the evolution of digital factories and enhancing supply chain performance. Azure IoT and Azure Stack enable customers and partners to build industrial IoT solutions that run at the edge, so operators on the factory floor can manage devices and analyze data in real-time. And HoloLens is quickly becoming an indispensable tool as we take digital twin technology to the next level.
We're also innovating in silicon to help customers realize the promise of a connected world of devices and things. Our just announced Azure Sphere is a first of its kind highly secure edge solution that combines chip design and IoT operating system and a cloud service to secure more than 9 billion microcontroller-powered devices entering the market each year.
And we're already seeing rapid customer adoption of IoT scenarios. Toyota Material Handling in Europe is using Azure as well as HoloLens to create a factory of the future. Using AI, drones learn complex processes to automate the flow of a factory, increasing supply chain and warehouse efficiency. And Microsoft and ABB are partnering to push the boundaries of smart manufacturing for industrial automation.
We're investing to make Azure the best cloud for enterprise data estates. In less than a year, Azure Cosmos DB, the first globally distributed multimodal and multi-model database, exceeded $100 million in annualized revenue. Azure database for MySQL and PostgreSQL makes it even easier to bring open source powered applications to Azure, expanding our opportunity in this space. We are seeing a rapid adoption of Azure Databricks for data preparation, advanced analytics and machine learning scenarios.
We continue to innovate to democratize AI. More than 1 million developers have already used Cognitive Services to quickly and easily create AI applications, and we have more services than any other cloud provider. Our Azure Bot Service has nearly 300,000 developers, up more than 150% year-over-year. Microsoft Translator brings AI-powered translation to developers where their data is, whether it's in the cloud or on the edge.
And just last month, we reached human parity in language translation, a new milestone in addition to our previous human parity achievements in object recognition, speech recognition and machine reading comprehension.
We're also gaining traction in machine learning tools adoption with tens of thousands of customers using Azure ML. Finally, we are innovating with new GPU and FPGA-based offerings to lead in AI infrastructure for both training and inference. I'm excited to share more about our cloud and AI innovation at our developer conference next month at Build.
Now, to gaming. We continue to pursue our expansive opportunity in gaming from the way games are created and distributed to how they are played and viewed. We had one of the best quarters in gaming with strong revenue performance and record levels of engagement. Software and services revenue grew 24% as we continued to attract, retain and deepen user relationships across Xbox Live, Game Pass and Mixer.
Xbox Live monthly active users grew to 59 million, up 13%. Our new first-party game, Sea of Thieves, drove gameplay across Windows 10 and Xbox One in addition to nearly 10 million hours of viewing on services like Mixer in its very first week.
Our results speak to the strength of our platform and services for both first-party and third-party experiences. And we'll continue to invest in our platform, enhancing our cloud services with AI capabilities for developers to quickly build and monetize games across PC, console and mobile.
In closing, intelligent cloud and intelligent edge represents a tremendous opportunity for our customers. It comes with a responsibility to ensure trust in technology. We are working to instill this trust in three key areas. The first is privacy. We recognize that privacy is a fundamental human right, and we have consistently acted accordingly.
Our success is grounded in our customers' success. We have been working towards the May 25th GDPR implementation date since 2016 with hundreds of engineers across the company working on end-to-end privacy architecture, and we'll ensure that all our products and services are GDPR compliant.
For customers, we will provide robust tools backed by our contractual commitments to help them comply with GDPR. In fact, for most customers it will be more effective and less costly to host their data in Microsoft's GDPR-compliant cloud than to develop and maintain GDPR compliance tools themselves.
Second, cybersecurity. In response to escalating cyber attacks around the world, we are leading a bold initiative to defend and protect our customers. We recently led a coalition of 34 global technology and security companies in signing the Cybersecurity Tech Accord. The accord is an important first step by the industry to help create a safer and more secure online environment for everyone.
Finally, we recently established the AI and Ethics in Engineering and Research Committee at Microsoft to ensure we always advance AI in an ethical and responsible way to benefit our customers and the broader society. This includes new investments in technology to detect and address bias in AI systems. Microsoft stands for trust, and this will continue to be a differentiating focus for us moving forward.
With that, I'll hand it over to Amy to cover our financial results in more detail and share our outlook. And I look forward to rejoining for your questions.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter revenue was $26.8 billion, up 16% and 13% in constant currency, with better than expected performance across all segments. Gross margin increased 16% and 13% in constant currency. Operating income increased 23% and 20% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $0.95, increasing 36% and 31% in constant currency.
From a geographic perspective, we saw broad-based strength across markets of all sizes, benefiting from the positive global corporate IT spend environment. Growth in cloud services increased our commercial annuity mix, up 2 points year-over-year to 89%. Along with healthy renewals, our sales teams and partners drove a higher volume of new business, leading to commercial bookings growth of 26% and 18% in constant currency. Commercial unearned came in slightly above our expectations due to FX, growing 20% and 17% in constant currency.
Commercial cloud revenue was $6 billion, increasing 58% and 55% in constant currency, highlighted by healthy growth in the U.S., Western Europe and the UK. We again improved commercial cloud gross margin, now at 57%, up 6 points, with improvement in each cloud service, most notably Azure.
We outperformed our expectation on company gross margin, finishing the quarter at 65%. We are up slightly year-over-year with improvement in our Productivity and Business Processes segment from Office 365 commercial and LinkedIn, offset by a decline in our intelligent cloud segment, driven by a greater mix of Azure revenue.
FX positively impacted revenue growth by 1 point more than expected, 3 points at the company and Productivity and Business Processes level and 2 points on both intelligent cloud and More Personal Computing. FX added 2 points of growth to COGS and operating expenses, 1 point more than expected.
Operating expenses grew 10% and 8% in constant currency as we continued to invest in commercial sales capacity, cloud engineering, and LinkedIn. Even with this accelerated pace of spend, we increased operating margin 2 points year-over-year, a direct result of our focused investments to drive top line growth.
Now, to the segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was approximately $9 billion, increasing 17% and 14% in constant currency, with better than expected results from Office 365 commercial and LinkedIn.
Office commercial revenue grew double digits again this quarter, up 14% and 12% in constant currency, including a couple points from a greater mix of contracts with higher in-period recognition. Office 365 commercial revenue grew 42% and 40% in constant currency, with continued installed base growth and ARPU expansion driven by customer migration to our premium workloads in E3 and E5. Office 365 commercial seats grew 28%, in line with the expected trend, given the increasing size of the installed base.
Office consumer revenue increased 12% and 9% in constant currency, driven by recurring subscription revenue and a growing overall installed base. Our Dynamics business accelerated this quarter, growing 17% and 14% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365 growth of 65%, 62% in constant currency. LinkedIn revenue grew 37% and 33% in constant currency, with more than $1.3 billion in revenue.
We continued to see outperformance across all segments, with record levels of engagement. Segment gross margin dollars increased 18% and 15% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage increased with margin improvements in Office 365 commercial and LinkedIn offsetting the increased mix of cloud revenue. Operating expenses grew 14% and 12% in constant currency as we continued to strategically invest in LinkedIn commercial sales capacity and cloud engineering. Operating income increased 23% and 19% in constant currency.
The intelligent cloud segment delivered $7.9 billion of revenue, increasing 17% and 15% in constant currency, exceeding expectations due to our on-premises server business.
Server products and cloud services revenue grew 20% and 17% in constant currency to $6.3 billion, driven by continued strong Azure revenue growth of 93%, 89% in constant currency on a significant revenue base.
Our on-premises server business grew 3% and 1% in constant currency, driven by customer demand for hybrid solutions as well as increasing virtualization needs, resulting in the uptake of premium versions.
Enterprise Services revenue increased 8% and 5% in constant currency, with growth in premium support services and Microsoft Consulting Services more than offsetting the continued decline in custom support agreements for Windows Server 2003.
Segment gross margin dollars grew 16% and 14% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage declined with the growing mix of Azure IaaS and PaaS revenue mostly offset by another quarter of material improvement in Azure gross margin.
Operating expenses increased 9% and 7% in constant currency, driven by our continued investment in sales capacity and cloud engineering. Operating income increased 24%, up 21% in constant currency.
Now to the results of More Personal Computing. Revenue from the segment was $9.9 billion, up 13% and 11% in constant currency, with significantly better than expected results in gaming, Windows commercial and Surface.
Windows OEM revenue increased 4% this quarter. OEM Pro revenue grew 11%, in line with a strong commercial PC market. We continued to see healthy enterprise demand for Windows 10, benefiting our OEM partners.
OEM non-Pro revenue declined this quarter by 8%, below the consumer PC market, driven by a higher mix of lower-priced licenses and continued pressure in the entry-level price category. Inventory levels were within the normal range.
Windows commercial products and cloud services increased 21% and 17% in constant currency from strong double digit billings as well as a higher mix of in-quarter recognition from multiyear agreements.
The fundamentals of this business remained healthy, with installed base growth and adoption of our security solutions. As a reminder, under Accounting Standard 606, the Windows commercial growth rate will have significant variability quarter-to-quarter due to its relatively high mix of on-premises licensing revenue.
Search revenue ex TAC grew 16% and 14% in constant currency with higher revenue per search and search volume driven by Bing performance in the U.S. and international markets.
Surface revenue grew 32% and 27% in constant currency with better than expected performance from Surface Book as we continued to transition to the latest products in our portfolio and against a prior year comparable impacted by product end-of-lifecycle dynamics.
Gaming revenue increased 18% and 16% in constant currency due to Xbox software and services revenue growth of 24% and 21% in constant currency. Momentum in digital distribution as well as record levels of engagement driven by a third-party title contributed to better than expected software and services revenue.
We grew Xbox Live monthly active users by 13% to 59 million with user expansion across Xbox One, Windows 10 and mobile platforms.
Segment gross margin dollars increased 13% and 11% in constant currency, in line with revenue growth. Segment gross margin percentage was relatively flat year-on-year. Operating expenses increased 5% and 3% in constant currency from investments in engineering across gaming, search and AI. Operating income grew 24% and 20% in constant currency.
Now back to the total company results. In line with our expectations, we increased capital expenditures on a sequential basis with $3.5 billion invested to support current and future growth of our cloud offerings. Cash paid for plant, property and equipment was $2.9 billion. Cash flow from operations was up 14%, driven by collections from strong billings growth.
Free cash flow of $9.2 billion grew at a slower rate, 3%, due to an increasing cash used for property, plant and equipment. Other income and expenses was approximately $350 million from net recognized gains on investments and income from dividends and interest, partially offset by interest expense. Our effective tax rate came in at 14% due to a benefit from an R&D tax credit.
We returned $6.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, increasing total shareholder return by 37%. We nearly doubled our year-over-year amount buyback, accelerating our pace from the prior quarter and now have roughly $30 billion remaining of our current $40 billion share repurchase authorization.
Now let's turn to next quarter's outlook. First on FX. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by 3 points, COGS by 1 point and operating expenses by 1 point.
Second, we again expect strong performance from our commercial business, with solid execution in our largest quarter of the year. We expect commercial unearned revenue to be up 38% to 39% sequentially.
Third on CapEx. We expect sequential growth in capital expenditures on an accrual dollar basis, as we continue to see strong demand signals globally.
Finally, we expect commercial cloud gross margin to be roughly flat to Q3, representing another quarter of material year-over-year improvement even with increasing Azure revenue mix.
Now to the segments. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $9.55 billion and $9.75 billion. We expect Office commercial growth rates to normalize as we do not expect the same level of in-quarter recognition on multiyear contracts as we saw in Q3. Dynamics should see another quarter of double-digit revenue growth, driven by Dynamics 365 and LinkedIn growth should remain high.
In Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $8.95 billion and $9.15 billion, with another quarter of server products and cloud services revenue growth in the high teens as our hybrid cloud leadership continues to be a differentiator for customers. We expect the total Azure revenue growth to reflect the balance of our continued strength in infrastructure, data and application services and a moderating growth in our per user base services like EMS.
In More Personal Computing, we expect $10.3 billion to $10.6 billion. Across both OEM Pro and non-Pro, we anticipate trends in Q3 to continue into Q4. In our devices business, we expect Surface revenue growth in the high teens, as we continue to transition to the latest products in our portfolio. Search ex TAC should see another mid-teens revenue growth quarter as it has the entire year.
In gaming, we expect a higher revenue growth rate than Q3, as we continue to benefit from third-party game title performance and user engagement on our platform. We expect COGS between $9.6 billion and $9.8 billion, including 1 point of growth from FX. We expect operating expenses of $9.8 billion to $9.9 billion, with 1 point of growth from FX. This would place us slightly above the high end of our prior range for the full year operating expense growth due to the impact from FX and incremental revenue-driven expenses that support our continued strong top line growth.
In Q4, we expect other income and expense to be approximately $350 million as we continue to take gains on our equities portfolio and earn dividend and interest income as we have in prior quarters. We expect our effective tax rate in Q4 to be approximately 16%, with some volatility in the final quarter of our fiscal year.
Finally, I want to offer a few early thoughts on FY 2019. Assuming the macro environment remains consistent, many of the key drivers of our business should remain intact. Revenue growth will continue to be driven by the transition to cloud services. And within our commercial business, strong execution and our differentiated hybrid position should drive continued high teens growth in our server product and cloud services revenue KPI.
Office 365, Dynamics 365 and LinkedIn should also continue to drive double-digit revenue growth in our Productivity and Business Processes segment. The gross margin percentage of every commercial cloud service will continue to improve, with more improvement in Azure IaaS and PaaS consumption-based services and less improvement in our per user SaaS services.
While we expect continued improvement in the overall commercial cloud gross margin, the revenue mix shift to Azure will moderate the rate of improvement relative to FY 2018. We will continue to grow our investment and capital expenditures to meet the growing demand for our cloud services.
With the business results we've delivered and the tremendous opportunities we see ahead, we will continue to see growth in operating expenses in key areas we've discussed, including LinkedIn. We expect other income and expenses to be slightly negative in FY 2019 as we don't expect to have any significant equity gains.
And lastly, we continue to expect the full year FY 2019 effective tax rate to be slightly below the new U.S. corporate tax rate of 21%, with variability across the quarters due to the mix of cloud versus license revenue and the timing of equity vests.
And with that, Mike, let's go to Q&A.
Michael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we be will conducting the question-and-answer session. Our first question is coming from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you, Satya and Amy. You guys are seeing a really nice acceleration in intelligent cloud gross profit growth. And with 15 straight quarters now of triple-digit premium services growth in Azure, I know you mentioned some comments directionally about the gross margin ramp. But how do we think about the pace of the ramp in gross margin expansion from here for this, for Azure in particular, as you approach what we estimate to be roughly an $8 billion business in annualized revenue? And I guess the other thing that would be helpful is when you think of the COGS of commercial cloud, can you give us a rough ballpark of what percentage of COGS comes from CapEx depreciation? Thank you.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
So maybe I'll start and then I'll have you, Amy, go into sort of the numbers. One of the things, Heather, that's happening is there is growth in Azure across each of the layers. And I think I've said this before. Sometimes, when you have new workloads and new customers onboard, they start with in some sense the IaaS and the data more at Blob storage, but then scale to higher layer services like our Cosmos DB or even some of our compute higher-level services like in AI.
So that I think will continue, because we're still in the early innings of the cloud transition. We're investing aggressively, whether it's on the field side or on the CapEx side to attract more customers and more workloads per customer. So they will have that same profile, which is lower-margin services first, higher-margin services over time. That's just inside of Azure. And of course, you combine that with the rest. One of the things that I think should be fairly clear is the high correlation between our services in Office 365 as well as Dynamics 365 around data in particular with Azure. So that's why we think of this as one cloud play but that should give you a feel for how the customers are looking at it.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And I think to your specific questions, there were a couple in there, Heather. If you think about the portion of our commercial cloud gross margins that come from depreciation, it's best to think of it as roughly half. And actually it's been going up as we began to get scale through these services over time actually. Some of the fixed costs, frankly, even in COGS, tend to come down as a percentage over time. So that should help you roughly to think about how much depreciation is at that number.
Now, if you think about some of the dynamics that we've been going through in the intelligent cloud segment, in particular the way I tend to think about that, as you've seen, we're now 20% growth this quarter in that server and product services KPI, 17% on a constant currency basis, and are sort of confident that you should continue to see that, as I said, into Q4 and then into FY 2019 as well.
I tend to think about that as we'll have significant revenue growth in that segment. We'll have significant gross margin dollar growth in that segment, and you'll actually continue to see operating margin dollar growth that's significant in that segment even as we reinvest into it, given the top line signal.
If you think about gross margins in particular, what you'll see is Azure continuing to be a growing percentage of the total revenue growth. So even with significant improvement again in, what Satya was talking about, some of the lower level IaaS and PaaS services within Azure, on the gross margin side you'll see some gross margin percentage pressure in that segment through 2019, but with significant dollar growth.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you.
Michael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Heather. We'll take next question now, please.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mark Moerdler with AllianceBernstein. Please proceed with your question.
Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Thank you very much, and congrats on the quarter. CapEx increased significantly this quarter, $2.9 billion you said in cash on property and equipment. We know that you build out – you significantly invest in the data center footprint ahead of demand, but you don't build out the equipment itself that far in advance. Is there a large corporate or government requirement or is it the acceleration in the new data centers that ended up causing that lift? Or is there something else driving it? And as a follow-up, how should we think about that for the next couple quarters? Thanks.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Mark. I actually didn't think of it as a significant change in trajectory from what we expected. A year ago, Q3 was actually a little low. So on the year-over-year basis, I think it pops a little bit, Mark, when on really a sequential basis I actually don't think, to me, it looks out of sorts, especially with the type of demand we're seeing, not just for Azure, but across all of the cloud components. Those growth rates really at 58% on that total cloud number, it's pretty good demand signal on a global basis. So I hear you on a year-over-year basis, but Q3 was a little funny a year ago on that front.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
And we continue to really monitor the actual equipment in that supply chain and what have you. And if anything, there's a lot of automation and demand sensing capability we have there.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Yeah. And I would say, Mark, while I appreciate your point that it takes – and we do build data centers in advance, the majority of the cost obviously in a data center is in the equipment inside. And so, while this really is – the majority of this spend is servers.
Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Perfect. Thank you.
Michael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Mark. Operator, can we please move to next question?

The next question is coming from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question and really nice quarter across the board. There's really not much to pick on in this quarter. One of the highlights from my perspective was definitely LinkedIn and what seems to be an acceleration in the revenue growth in LinkedIn. So a two-parter here. One, where are we in terms of that acquisition? Is this still just LinkedIn operating better as an independent company or are we starting to see some of the synergies, specifically revenue synergies, come to bear from maybe broader distribution channel that they get from Microsoft or product integration? So have synergies started to kick in, number one?
And number two, given where we are in terms of the M&A process on LinkedIn, what's the appetite for further like large M&A for Microsoft on a going-forward basis?
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Keith, for the question. Let me start and then, Amy, you can add to this. First of all, it is very important for us to ensure that we did everything to enable LinkedIn to keep their product and cultural ethos of putting members first and innovating on their behalf. I mean, that was sort of our priority one, two and three. And that's what you see in their sessions growth, engagement growth, their quality member growth. And obviously that all translates into the revenue growth as well across all of the marketing solutions, talent solutions, and sales solutions.
We also, during that one year, done integrations. You see it. I see it every day in my Outlook Mobile. I see it in Sales Navigator and Dynamics. And so, you will see us – with Windows 10, so you'll see us continue to do these integrations that add value again to both the Microsoft 365 and Dynamics users, as well as LinkedIn members.
And clearly that's increasing engagement as well and that obviously then translates into revenue growth of those business solutions we mentioned. So, yes, revenue synergies are showing up, but mostly because product synergies are showing up, and that's because of the product ethos of LinkedIn around member-first is what we have maintained throughout this integration.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And I would also add, Keith, the LinkedIn team has really done a tremendous job. So let me also say, after a year of working with them closely, my appreciation and, frankly, a lot of inspiration that I think you've seen in our own product development has been their focus on users and how important it is and how focused they are on it.
In some of the products, I would urge people to look at the Outlook Mobile experience and how really meaningful the experience is for the user and the member. And I think sometimes it's harder for us to measure exactly what a revenue synergy means. But I think I look at this and say, at a 37% growth rate, plus some of the integrations we've seen and the growth in uses and users of things like Outlook Mobile, I believe that we're probably a little bit on the front end of the revenue synergies you'll see in product over time.
When it comes to our appetite for M&A, actually it has remained unchanged, which is when things meet our criteria and when we feel like it's in core areas for us, where markets are expanding, where the companies have a unique asset, I think that our ability to both execute on those and see them both execute on their own and execute inside Microsoft, I actually feel quite good that we don't worry about our ability to do them, but I wouldn't say that's new this quarter.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Yeah. And I think just to add on that, which is whether it's Minecraft or LinkedIn or many other acquisitions we've done as part of Azure, I think the key thing that we are very, very focused on is how do we make this culturally accretive, management times accretive as well as revenue. And that's where we are building good muscle and we'll continue on that.
Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Excellent. Thank you very much guys.
Michael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Keith. We'll take the next question now please.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thanks. And just to start, Satya and team congrats on getting Microsoft to over 10% organic growth. That's a big achievement for a company at your scale, and it looks like you're expecting the same for the June quarter, so congrats. So I guess, my question is in the spirit of this, to Amy, on the overall growth margin trade-off as you look into fiscal 2019.
Amy, when I go back to the Analyst Day you had almost a year ago, I left thinking that your messaging was really that you were going to press on revenue growth and not on big margin leverage. So I'm just wondering as we look into fiscal 2019, is it correct to assume that that's a similar framework with the focus on top line growth and not to expect much in the way of overall improvement in gross margins? Thank you.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Karl. Yes, I think that's a fair interpretation of my commentary both last year and this, which really speaks to consistency. I do believe that the market that which we are operating, the set of assets we've picked, the team we've built, the investments we made in our sales force, even some extent the acquisitions we've done, these are all showing up as top line revenue growth for us. You see it this quarter. You see it frankly in the guide. And I think your interpretation that our focus on being a growth company, even at our scale, is certainly the right interpretation.
Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thanks for that.
Michael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Karl. Let's please move to the next question.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Hi, Thank you. I'm wondering, maybe a combination of Amy and Satya, talk about the forward kind of view of Azure growth and how we should think about the drivers of that as we go into 2019. New customers existing consumption, premium services and I think we're growing at eye-popping rates right now. We saw that with Office 365 in the early days. How should we expect this business to sort of level out over time as I think it inevitably will as we look to next year?
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Yeah and I'll start qualitatively. And it's true that we are at this point at scale on Azure and with very, very high growth rates. But as I said, I think the key things that we think about is differentiation of Azure at each level because that's what is super important for us as we compete in this marketplace and more importantly double down on areas of differentiation we have.
So the first thing is on the infrastructure side itself with the combination of the edge and the cloud I believe between Azure Stack and Azure as well as inclusive of our servers, we have the best crowd platform for what is going to be hybrid computing and we'll continue to push on that, so you'll see growth. It's just got a different margin profile.
The layer above that is the place which we are very excited about. We've seen lots of consecutive quarters of growth in our higher-level services but we're now seeing some good scale. I, for the first time, talked about Cosmos DB. This was actually a database we just launched last year. I mean, I've been around databases for a long time. I've never seen a product that's gotten to this kind of scale this quickly.
And so we're very bullish about what can happen in the higher-level services and we'll continue to build on that piece. But as I said, one of the key things is, architecturally, the way we build Azure, the way we build Office 365, the way we build our gaming cloud and the way we build even Dynamics are all pretty much one architecture.
And you see that even in the way customers use it. So overall to your specific question on Azure, the growth will moderate as the numbers become big, and they've already become very big. But that said, we see plenty of opportunity for total gross margin growth in terms of dollars just because of the number of markets that we participate, in which we by the way, never participated in the old server world.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And, Walter, I think the way you see that show up is really in my conversation on FY 2019, to Satya's point, really we talked about that server product and KPI being high teens through FY 2019. We're really confident in double-digit growth in that PBP segment with the components of Office 365, Dynamics 365 and LinkedIn. So if you think about that as the primary components of our commercial cloud overall, we're certainly saying that it's a big business growing very fast at $6 billion not counting LinkedIn. At 58% growth, it certainly speaks to having a big base and a big growth number.
On Azure, you're right. It will moderate through next year. But because of the scale at which it's operating, that's why you still see that server KPI remain at that high level even as the base grows. And so you will see also some different dynamics within that Azure revenue number. Satya mentioned the layers of Azure. If you think about the IaaS and PaaS numbers, I would expect to be on the higher end of growth rates. And some of the services that are more per-user like, like EMS within the Azure frame, you would expect that growth to moderate somewhat more quickly just because it's a per-seat business.
You will actually over time see us be able to continue to add ARPU and growth in those segments. Think of it almost like an Office business. Internally, we call that component part of our Microsoft 365 Value. That's how we sell it externally even. And so hopefully, that helps give a little context to the number as well as our overall ability to continue to grow the sort of hybrid cloud opportunity high teens.
Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.

Hey guys, thank you guys for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter. Satya, you touched on the synergies that you're seeing between new applications businesses and LinkedIn helping the two out. Wonder if you could talk just sort of high level and strategically about applications and enterprise applications in Azure, and how you kind of see the synergy potentially coming out between those, especially when you think about Azure AI and all the services, or kind of the question is, how important or how critical are applications like the growth that we're seeing in Dynamics, et cetera?
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Yes, I mean, one of the things that I talked about in my remarks this time was this power platform. One of the areas of in fact real breakout growth in differentiation as being in Power BI, PowerApps and Flow. For the first time in fact, in our own Microsoft history, we have an extensibility model that is the same for Office 365 and Dynamics 365. This has been a dream of mine for, I don't know, for 15 years probably. And we are finally here and we are executing super well.
But the interesting thing is it's not just even for our own SaaS applications. It is the extensibility model for every SaaS application out there, including a common data model. So I think that that's where the synergies lie, because AI starts with having a data estate that can really bring data from all of your applications, silos in some sense, together so that you can start doing, building that analytical power that you can then visualize and put in the hands of people using Power BI or run an AI model that does some prediction that you can deploy in your system, whether it's forecasting, sales lead scoring, what have you.
So that workflow, we have every layer of it. We have the best deployment tools and development tools in Azure. We have this common data model. On top of this, we have the best BI visualization technology. So that's what you're seeing increasingly as the synergy. But most importantly, architectural benefit for customers because by having incoherence around these layers is where you may feel like you're making some great best-of-breed sort of choices in individual layers, but you'll bear that expense in your overall agility as well as your overall management of your data. And that's where I think we will be very differentiated.
Philip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Great, thanks guys.
Michael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks. Let's move to the next question please.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Okay, we'll move on to the next question which is coming from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
Brad Robert Reback - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Great, thanks very much. Maybe Amy, quick question. The Windows OEM Pro business has been extraordinarily strong the last few quarters. Could you maybe give us a sense of how penetrated you guys are in the Windows 10 corporate upgrade cycle and the sustainability of that growth? Thanks.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks Brad. Let me, first, I wouldn't say penetration is the word for this. Let me talk about this in two or even a couple of components, because when you think about Windows 10, what we've seen over the past couple of years is, you're right, a very strong enterprise deployment cycle and real pull for that product inside enterprises, because of the security value prop of the product itself.
When you see that deployment for security reasons, an externality of that is people often choose to upgrade machines in that process. We've seen good demand inside commercial entities for and when they make those upgrades to buy Windows PCs and often Surface devices, in that choice, I think it's benefited our OEM partners and us. The portfolio of devices that are available are incredibly compelling. I think our partners have done a terrific job on that as well.
The overall economy is certainly also quite good, and the installed base had actually gotten older. And so I think what you're starting to see is a process whereby there's a great product, there's a good macro environment. And you've got customers who really want to move to a modern infrastructure. A modern infrastructure has to both be secure at its very core, and that can result, as you're seeing through that confluence of events, in a very strong PC market with very strong Pro performance. And certainly, the guide for Q4 continues to imply all those factors.
Brad Robert Reback - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Great. Thanks very much.
Michael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Brad. We'll take next question now, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Michael Nemeroff with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Nemeroff - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Thanks for taking my question. Satya or Amy, can you help us understand the large revenue outperformance and guide for continued strong growth in gaming? And Amy, could you please give us a sense of the margin profile of the areas of gaming that exceeded expectations? And if you could also comment on the strength of the MPC margin in the context of the gaming margin as well, that would be helpful. Thank you very much.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Yeah, I can start and then, yeah.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Why don't you start.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Because even on gaming, very much like how we talk about some of our commercial segments, we've gotten a strategy which sort of really helps us articulate both the growth opportunity as well as our investments across all of the various layers.
So first is, the console itself is the highest engagement console out in the marketplace. So anytime a new game, whether it's first-party or third-party releases, the fact that Xbox is where the best engagement is driven benefits us. So as a platform owner, that's a great growth area for us. But we don't stop there because now we have, whether it's Xbox Live, whether it's Game Pass or Mixer, these are all additional opportunities to really serve the gamer as they play more games or watch games on different platforms. So that's the other big opportunity.
But the last one, which I think is new and is something which is already paying its dividends on the Azure growth side, is we've taken all the knowledge of what it means to build any one of these first-party titles of ours and building it as a PaaS service in Azure for game developers, and the PlayFab acquisition speaks directly to that. So those are all the various levers we have in gaming. And you'll see it in the MPC segment and you'll see it, as I said, increasingly over time even on Azure.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And I think, Michael, if you don't mind, I'm going to expand your question a little bit, because I don't think the increase in the MPC guide is simply gaming. So let me talk a bit about the components and which ones, I think, are a bit more sustainable and which ones may have a temporal nature to them.
The performance in Q3 and the guidance for Q4 shows actually strong performance in a number of places that we expect to continue. OEM Pro is a terrific example, for the reasons I just gave in Brad's question. Windows commercial, which is really the business inside the enterprise of selling much of the security value on a far more annuity-like basis, we've seen strong double-digit billings growth there and we expect that to continue into Q4 as well.
The next piece that I would say is a part of that sort of uplift in Q4 is our Surface device. The reception to Surface Book 2 as well as Surface Pro with LTE has been quite good. And you see us reflect that again in Q4 even as the comparable gets a little bit more difficult than it was in Q3 for us when you saw a very large growth rate. We're still expecting high teens there.
Then you get to that gaming component, and specifically what Satya was talking about, the Xbox software and services component is where I would expect to see the impact of the continuation of Q3. Part of that, I want to be very clear, is consistent even going back a few quarters. That has been a double-digit grower. It will be a double-digit grower. There'll be some volatility in the number like anything else. And third-party hit games will move it higher as they did this quarter, and we're expecting in Q4. But there's also a really strong base to that business that is the result of what Satya's talking about in terms of having a vibrant platform with fans that believe in it and come to it with all the value that's been added.
Michael Nemeroff - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
That's very helpful. Thank you very much.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
So did that help? Okay, great. Thanks.
Michael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Michael. We'll move to the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets
Thanks so much. Hopefully, the line is clear this time. So Satya and Amy, I wanted to ask about server products which was striking growth this quarter, given the comp. And, Amy, you talked about expected strength into fiscal Q4 and all of that, I guess, is testament to the strength of the kind of hybrid leadership you have. But the two questions though were really, is that strength in server products broad-based across Windows Server, SQL Server, System Center, et cetera? Or is there any sort of bias in the mix, if you will, in terms of what's driving that strength?
And then, Satya, you mentioned Cosmos DB and that was a striking number to me as well. And I was just curious, do you think now you have the multi-model database in market that can help you take market share within the data management database space? Thanks.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Yeah. I mean, I'll take the second one. I think that, yes, I mean, Cosmos DB's pretty unique capability in combination with everything else we do in both the data layer, the AI layer and the infrastructure layer, I think we have a tremendous opportunity, because, as I said, this AI era is mostly first a data era. And that's where I think the opportunity lies.
But to your previous question, even there, there are multiple trends here, and Amy referenced it in her remarks, which is for example, virtualization still continues to be a growth driver of server products. The other growth driver of server products is cybersecurity and the security value in our servers. So that's one.
The fact that we now have SQL and, for example, when you think about SQL itself, it's a hybrid product. You can tier SQL databases with the cloud. SQL is an AI product because we have the one database that actually allows you to write Python and R in situ, store procedures right in your database.
So, for example, when we talk about data and AI close to data, because computation will always go wherever data is. And a lot of data shows up in relational databases and we have a growth driver there as well. And then there is the hybrid choices, where if somebody's building a smart factory, they're now looking and saying, what is the server I deploy in the factory to manage the millions of sensors that are there across the factory. And that's where Azure Stack shows up. So multiple drivers of what is essentially the server and cloud number in combination.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And to your point on the component, the on-prem component, even with comparable doing well, let me break Satya's comment into sort of two drivers that have been actually more sustaining. And it's across both Windows in particular, but also SQL, which are obviously the largest products within our server portfolio.
The first exactly with hybrid demand. We have something called Azure Hybrid Benefits. What it does is really provide confidence to our committed customers buying on-prem servers that their transition to a hybrid, to cloud over a period of their agreement, is really about their choices, their timelines and their confidence. And so, with that right, it lets them easily transition between Windows or SQL to those same benefits in Azure with a small uplift in price. I think that has actually been a core component.
The second one was the virtualization drive or data center modernization, another one, do move the premium mix up a bit. So that's, if you wanted to break it down into two more sustaining things, those are the types of things we're seeing in that number.
Michael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.
Great. Thanks. And this will be our last question.
Operator
Thank you. Our final question is coming from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Last question will be the longest one; really, really long. Thank you guys for getting me in. A question for you, Satya. As you meet with CEOs of large companies, this is a recurring theme that we've been hearing from other software company CEOs, the theme of digitization. Can you help us to understand, especially given that Microsoft's growth rate is accelerating whereas the GDP growth rate is the GDP growth rate.
So obviously, tech spending or IT spending as a percentage of GDP or average company revenue is going higher. So can you help us, given your perspective, which is pretty unique, help us understand what is the baseline of IT that we've been operating in, when it comes to digital business transformation, what are the phase 1, phase 2, phase 3 initiatives like and where are companies likely to spend more? And what kinds of products and services that are new and upcoming or maybe you sell them today that comprise that incremental swing factor over the baseline of what IT is today versus wherever we're likely to go with the digitization of business processes? Thank you.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Yeah, I mean, I think when we talk to customers and CDOs, CEOs, what have you, we talk about four digital transformational outcomes. In fact, everything that we do across our solution areas are all ingredients to helping our customers achieve digital transformation objectives on, for example, how do they engage their customers. When I talked about Cosmos DB growth, Cosmos DB happens to be one of the best database products to be able to capture the signals that you want around your customers from a variety of different sources. That's gone one example of it.
The second piece is of course around empowering your employees. I mean, one of the things that now has increasingly become a number one priority for every CEO is to make sure that the right tools, the right products are in front of their own employees so that they can do their very best work and collaborate. So teams grow. There's a great example of how companies are modernizing their workforce with things like Microsoft 365.
The third one is operational efficiency. When you see the Dynamics 365 growth or Azure IoT growth, taking every IoT project, it ends up as a field service project, so that's a classic way somebody says, let me sense something, predict something and then actually fix using field service. So that's a transformational outcome where we're very well positioned.
And lastly, people are changing their business models. You take somebody like a Nalco Water. You could say they're a water company, but now they're pure water service company. In other words, they put sensors that allow them to actually deliver a very differentiated business model to their customers. And so that's the transformational outcomes we see. And we feel, at Microsoft, we're well positioned both with the technology but also with our frontline sales capability, service capability and partner capacity to best address the digital transformation needs.
Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Wonderful. It seems like CRM, HCM, ERP, IoT, these are the predominant themes that are going to be driving your growth. Thank you very much. Very useful, insightful.

Welcome to the Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Microsoft Corporation Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to turn the call over to Chris Suh, General Manager of Investor Relations. Chris, please proceed.
Chris Suh
Thank you, Ria. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and Carolyn Frantz, our new Deputy General Counsel, Corporate Secretary.
On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provide to the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. This quarter, we incurred tax charge related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We have excluded the impact of this tax charge in our non-GAAP net income and earnings per share metrics.
These non-GAAP financial metrics should not be considered as the substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They're included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's second quarter performance in addition to the impact that these items and events had on the financial results.
All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses is performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only.
We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website until January 31, 2019.
During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during the conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.
Satya Nadella
Thank you, Chris, and thanks to everyone on the phone for joining. Our results this quarter speak to us picking the right secular trends and markets, and following that up with focused innovation and execution. The intelligent cloud and intelligent edge paradigm is fast becoming a reality. Azure growth accelerated. LinkedIn growth accelerated. Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365 are driving our growth and transforming the workplace. Xbox is reaching new customers with new offers.
With that as the backdrop, I want to highlight key areas of innovation and growth across our customer solutions. Every CEO I talk to is keen to start their transformation journey by empowering their employees in creating a modern workplace. They want productivity and collaboration tools that deliver continuous innovation and do so securely.
Spectre and Meltdown are the latest instances in an increasingly complex threat environment. Our investments to make Windows 10 the most secure, always up-to-date operating system enabled us to move quickly to protect customers in the face of these threats.
Protecting customers will continue to be a top priority. Our continued commitment to operational security and advanced technology is one reason customers like BP, Goodyear, PayPal are choosing Microsoft 365. MasterCard chose Microsoft 365 to empower employees and inspire teamwork with integrated apps like Teams, Yammer and SharePoint.
We're infusing AI across Microsoft 365 with the simple goal of helping people do their best work. Insights in Excel is a new service that uses machine learning to detect and highlight patterns. Translator brings 60 languages to Word. We're helping people be more productive on the go on any platform with real-time co-authoring in Office apps on iOS, Android and now the Mac.
And just this month, we announced that dictation will be available across multiple apps in Office 365, empowering users to write freely using only their voice. We're making voice a first-class input for productivity. Cortana can help manage your e-mail, by pulling up important e-mails, reading them aloud, and letting you reply using just your voice.
We're also bringing Cortana's intelligence to Outlook Mobile app, notifying you when it's time to leave a meeting to get to your next one, based on your location and traffic.
Mixed Reality empowers employees with new immersive experiences. Enterprise customers like Mercedes Benz in Germany are using Mixed Reality to transform training, helping maintenance technicians learn everything from guided brake repair to how components in a new diesel engine work.
We're expanding our opportunity with Microsoft 365 for organizations of all types and sizes. Take Firstline Workers, leading global telecommunications, retail and hospitality companies such as BT, Target, Panera Bread and Delta Global Services, all chose Office 365 to maximize the impact of their Firstline Workforce.
In education, we're empowering every student with new learning tools natively built into Office 365 to improve reading, writing and comprehension, as well as Mixed Reality experiences for immersive learning.
This quarter, we launched Surface LTE and unveiled a new generation of always-on, always-connected Windows 10 PCs from our OEM partners. With up to 20 days of standby power, this new category of PCs, deeply integrated with Cortana and with new near-field and far-field capability, will fundamentally change productivity.
Now, I'll turn to LinkedIn and business applications. As we pass the one-year mark of Microsoft and LinkedIn, uniting the world's leading professional cloud with the world's leading professional network, LinkedIn continues its strong trajectory with accelerating revenue growth and record levels of engagement. The fifth consecutive quarter of more than 20% sessions growth.
Appetite for conversations across the platform continues to grow from sharing in the feed, to video, to one-on-one messages sent, all up more than 60% year-over-year. This increased engagement across the platform is driving strong growth in demand for sponsored content and marketing solutions and record levels of job postings and job visitors in Talent Solutions.
LinkedIn is continually creating new ways for members to connect and engage with one another, such as this quarter's launch of Career Advice. From the deeper integration of Sales Navigator and Dynamics 365 for Sales and Dynamics for Talent to the launch of Profile Card to bring personalized LinkedIn insights directly into Office 365 to the new Resume Assistant. I'm excited about the many ways in which we are delivering powerful customer and member experiences that leverage both the Microsoft and LinkedIn Graphs.
We continue to see good momentum in Dynamics 365 with revenue growth of 67% year-over-year. Our modern and modular business process applications are resonating with customers driving digital transformation. Park Place Technologies, a global leader in datacenter support, chose Dynamics 365 along with LinkedIn Sales Navigator integration. And United Technologies and Columbia Sportswear chose Dynamics 365 and Azure for their digital transformation.
Now I'll talk about Cloud and AI. As Intelligent Cloud, Intelligent Edge becomes more predominant, our architectural advantage is increasingly clear to our customers. You see this reflected in the latest CIO surveys, as well as in our 98% Azure revenue growth this quarter. Only Microsoft delivers hybrid consistency, developer productivity, AI capabilities, and trusted security and compliance. This architectural advantage helps us address both existing enterprise workloads and new workloads such as IoT and Edge AI.
To thrive in this new era, customers need a consistent stack across public cloud and the edge, a model Azure Stack uniquely enables. Since broad availability just a few months ago, we are seeing incredible customer demand for Azure Stack across a diverse set of industries, including Schlumberger, ABB and Mitsui Knowledge Industry.
We are democratizing data science and AI, so any organization can convert their data into actionable insights and drive competitive advantage. Azure Cosmos DB is the first globally distributed, multi-model database. It is unique in its support for a new class of low-latency, event-based server-less applications.
Azure Databricks brings leading Apache Spark-based analytics. Our new SQL Server on Linux is off to a strong start with more than 5 million downloads and will bring more developers to the SQL ecosystem longer term.
To thrive in a world with millions of intelligent end points, every company needs an IoT strategy. Microsoft is giving customers comprehensive solutions to help them realize the promise of connected world of devices and things.
Azure IoT Central is the first global-scale SaaS offering that enables customers to build intelligent, secure, enterprise-grade IoT app in hours. Azure Event Grid simplifies the creation of event-driven IoT solutions across millions of end points. Azure IoT Edge enables customers to run server-less computing and machine learning models at the edge.
Chevron is using Azure IoT to harness massive amounts of data from its oil fields to accelerate deployment of new, intelligent solutions for oil exploration and to manage thousands of oil wells worldwide, increasing revenue and improving safety and reliability of their operations. Kohler is building connected, voice-activated products powered by Azure IoT and Johnson Controls is using large-scale device management capabilities in Azure IoT and Windows IoT for their new smart GLAS thermostat with Cortana voice control.
We reached the human parity milestone in machine reading comprehension using the Stanford Question Answer Dataset benchmark, which is the ability for AI to read a document and answer questions about it. We're using this and other AI advances to address some of society's most pressing challenges by partnering broadly across industries.
In healthcare, we are partnering with Adaptive Biotechnologies to build a practical solution for mapping the human immune system to detect cancer and other diseases in the earliest stages. We've created a HIPAA-compliant Health Bot powered by Azure Cognitive Services to assist with questions about health insurance, symptoms, and location of nearby doctors. Aurora Healthcare, UPMC and Premera Blue Cross have already signed on.
In retail, Kroger is using Azure to power their digital grocery store display solution for real-time pricing and promotions based on customer data to boost sales. Lowe's autonomous in-store robot uses Azure to keep constant tabs on inventory and identify out of stock or misplaced items, freeing store employees to focus on their customers. And Publicis Groupe's new AI platform built on Azure and Office 365 will empower their 80,000 employees worldwide.
Now, let me turn to Gaming. Our new Xbox One X was the top selling premium console this holiday in the United States, and we saw strong sales of the Xbox One S. We will continue to innovate in console to attract high value gamers, who want immersive 4K experiences, to build a broader subscription service with Game Pass, and to extend our services to all devices in our customers' lives across console, PC and mobile.
Our decision to release exclusive game content on the Xbox Game Pass simultaneously with global release increases the value of the subscription for members and our partners, and we are off to a very good start.
We grew gamer engagement again this quarter with 59 million monthly active Xbox Live members, record usage of our Xbox Live services, record viewers of our new streaming service, Mixer, and record Minecraft users.
Finally, we just acquired PlayFab, which serves more than 700 million gamers with more than 1,200 games from companies like Disney, Rovio and Atari. It's a complete backend platform for mobile, PC and console game developers to build, launch, and scale cloud-connected games, extending our investments in Azure to provide a world-class cloud platform for the gaming industry.
Before I turn over to Amy, I want to reflect on a topic that is at the forefront of every customer conversation that I have. In an era, where there is rapid transformation driven by digital technology, customers are looking for a trusted partner. Someone with a business model that is aligned with their long-term interests, deep technical innovation, and an understanding of the responsibility that goes along with this innovation. This perhaps is one our key differentiators. Internally, we have a saying, Microsoft runs on trust. And we strive to earn it every day with all of the constituents we serve.
Now, I'll hand it over to Amy, who will cover our financial results in more detail and share our outlook. And I look forward to rejoining you for the questions later.
Amy Hood
Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. Our second quarter revenue was $28.9 billion, up 12% and 11% in constant currency, with better than expected performance across all segments. Gross margin increased 12%. Operating income increased 10%. This quarter, we incurred a tax charge of $13.8 billion related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Excluding that, earnings per share was $0.96, increasing 20%.
We achieved another quarter of double-digit top and bottom line growth, as we continued to realize the impact of strategic growth investments, along with strong sales execution.
At a company level, LinkedIn contributed approximately 4 points of revenue growth and 5 points of gross margin growth, with minimal impact on operating income growth. Excluding the cost of amortization of acquired intangibles, LinkedIn contributed a $111 million to operating income and continues to be accretive to EPS this fiscal year, ahead of our original expectations.
Across most geographies, our results were in line with overall, improving macroeconomic trends. Large markets including the U.S., Western Europe and France performed better than expected, driven by commercial cloud momentum.
Our sales teams and channel partners delivered another quarter of outstanding commercial results even as we continue to work through our sales reorganization from July. Our commercial revenue annuity mix improved by 3 points year-over-year to 86% with healthy renewal rates.
Commercial bookings increased 7% and 4% in constant currency, even with a 20% smaller underlying expiration base. Commercial unearned revenue came in slightly higher than expected, at more than $20.2 billion, from growth in multiyear customer commitments to Azure.
Commercial cloud revenue was $5.3 billion, growing 56% year-over-year, with broad-based growth across geographic markets and customer segments. Gross margin increased by 7 points to 55%, in line with seasonal trends. We improved gross margin percentage in each cloud service, and Azure again saw the most significant margin improvement this quarter. Company gross margin was 62% and flat year-over-year.
Sales mix of higher margin products and services, including better than expected performance from Windows Server and Windows OEM Pro, combined with improving cloud margins offset the impact of the growing mix of cloud revenue, LinkedIn amortization cost, and device launches.
The FX impact on company and segment revenue growth was in line with expectations. The weaker U.S. dollar increased revenue growth by less than 1 point. FX had only 1 point of impact on operating expense growth, less than expected. This quarter, operating expenses grew 14% and 13% in constant currency, with 10 points of growth from LinkedIn, including $154 million of amortization expense. We continued to increase investments in cloud engineering, AI and sales capacity to drive future growth.
Now to the segment results. Productivity and Business Processes revenue grew 25% and 24% in constant currency to $9 billion, slightly better than expected, fueled by LinkedIn revenue acceleration. LinkedIn contributed 15 points of growth.
Office Commercial revenue grew double-digits again this quarter, increasing 10% year-over-year. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 41% from installed base growth across all customer segments, and ARPU expansion from continued customer migration to higher value offers in the E3 and E5 workloads. Office 365 commercial seats grew 30% in line with the expected trend, given the increasing size of the base.
Office Consumer revenue increased 12% and 11% in constant currency, driven by Office 365 recurring subscription revenue and growth in our subscriber base, now at 29.2 million. Our Dynamics business grew 10% and 9% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365 revenue growth of 67% and 68% in constant currency.
LinkedIn revenue for the quarter was better than expected, at $1.3 billion, driven by strong sales execution across all LinkedIn services. We saw continued strength in user engagement, customer acquisition, renewals, and upsell performance.
Segment gross margin dollars increased 24% and 23% in constant currency, with 14 points of contribution from LinkedIn, including the impact of $222 million of amortization expense. Gross margin percentage decreased slightly due to the impact of LinkedIn related amortization expense and the increased mix of cloud services.
Operating expenses grew 41%, 39% in constant currency, with 33 points of contribution from LinkedIn, including $154 million of amortization expense. Excluding LinkedIn, operating expenses increased on cloud engineering and sales capacity investments. Operating income increased 9% and 10% in constant currency, with only 2 points of negative impact from LinkedIn.
The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered $7.8 billion of revenue, growing 15%, with better than expected performance driven by hybrid cloud. Server products and cloud services revenue grew 18% with another quarter of double-digit annuity revenue growth. Azure revenue growth accelerated to 98%, with Azure premium services revenue growing triple-digits for the 14th consecutive quarter.
Enterprise Services revenue grew 5%, and 3% in constant currency, as growth in Premier Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services was partially offset by declines in custom support agreements for Windows Server 2003.
Segment gross margin dollars grew 13%, and gross margin percentage declined slightly, as the impact of increasing cloud revenue mix was mostly offset by material improvement in Azure gross margin. Operating expenses grew 3% and 2% in constant currency from ongoing investments in sales capacity and cloud engineering. Operating income increased 24%.
In More Personal Computing, revenue was $12.2 billion, up 2%, with better than expected results driven by Windows and Search. Excluding phone, revenue grew 4%. Our Windows OEM business grew 4% this quarter, better than we expected.
OEM Pro revenue reflects a stronger than anticipated commercial PC market bolstered by improved macro conditions and continued healthy enterprise Windows 10 deployments. We benefitted as well from a higher mix of premium licenses and the timing of license purchases.
OEM Non-Pro revenue was down 5 points, below the stabilizing consumer PC market. We continued to see growth in the premium category in line with the market, but heightened price competition on entry-level devices contributed to lower volumes. Inventory levels remained in the normal range.
Windows commercial products and cloud services declined 4% and 5% in constant currency, mainly due to the impact of a large deal in the prior year.
Search revenue ex-TAC grew 15% from higher revenue per search driven by continued optimization of our advertising platform, and search volume growth in both the U.S. and international markets. Surface revenue grew 1%, roughly flat in constant currency, as we continued to transition our portfolio towards Surface Laptop, Pro with LTE and the new Surface Book 2.
This holiday quarter, Gaming revenue grew 8%, mainly driven by hardware revenue growth of 14%, 13% in constant currency, from the launch of our premium console, the Xbox One X. Xbox software and services revenue growth was 4%, with continued monetization growth partially offset by prior year first party AAA title launches.
Segment gross margin dollars were roughly flat year-over-year, with the decline in Gaming offset by growth in Search and Surface. Segment gross margin percentage declined, as expected with the console launch.
Operating expenses increased 2%, and 1% in constant currency, from growth in engineering investments in Search, AI and Gaming that were partially offset by declines in Windows marketing and phone expenses. Operating income declined 2%. As a reminder, Q2 was the last quarter of phone comparability given the sale of the feature phone business last year.
Now back to the overall company results. As expected, our capital expenditures, including finance leases, increased sequentially to $3.3 billion due to higher levels of customer demand and usage for our cloud services. Cash paid for property and equipment was $2.6 billion.
Free cash flow generation - free cash flow grew this quarter 23% driven by operating cash flow growth of 25%. Free cash flow increased from higher customer collections following strong billings growth, working capital improvements in the hardware business and contribution from LinkedIn. Other income and expenses was $490 million this quarter, more than planned, due to higher interest income.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate this quarter was 18%, lower than anticipated, driven by an audit settlement as well as the normal variability between service and license revenue mix, geographic revenue mix, and the timing of equity vests. We returned $5 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends.
Now let's turn to next quarter's outlook. Assuming rates - assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by 2 points, COGS by 1 point and operating expenses by 1 point.
With positive IT spend signals, a strengthening commercial PC market and growing customer demand for hybrid cloud services, we expect our commercial business to remain strong, as we drive annuity growth, expand our installed base and execute well on renewals. We expect commercial unearned revenue to be down approximately 2% to 3% sequentially, in line with historic seasonality. And our Q3 expiry base will return to year-over-year growth, impacting commercial bookings growth.
Third, CapEx. We will increase our capital expenditures to support increasing demand and capacity requirements. On an accrual dollar basis, we expect a sequential dollar increase next quarter.
We expect year-over-year improvement in overall commercial cloud gross margin as Azure margin improvement continues to offset an increasing mix of Azure revenue. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $8.6 billion and $8.8 billion. Both Office commercial and consumer revenue growth will be driven by Office 365, with growth rates for each consistent with Q2.
We expect double-digit Dynamics revenue growth from the shift to Dynamics 365. LinkedIn should deliver approximately $1.2 billion, growing more than 20%.
In Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $7.55 billion and $7.75 billion, with strong double-digit revenue growth in server products and cloud services. In Enterprise Services, we expect a revenue growth rate similar to Q2, as growth in Premier support should offset the decline in Windows 2003 custom support agreements.
In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $9.1 billion and $9.4 billion. In Windows, we expect OEM revenue to be largely in line with the total PC market. Both OEM Pro revenue and Non-Pro revenue should be impacted by similar dynamics seen in Q2.
Now to Devices, Surface revenue should grow year-over-year from continued launch momentum from the latest Surface Pro, Book and Laptop, but decline sequentially consistent with holiday seasonality.
In Search ex-TAC, we expect a similar strong rate of revenue growth to Q2. In Gaming, we expect revenue growth similar to last quarter, but with a revenue-mix shift to software and services and continued year-over-year growth of our Xbox Live user-base.
We expect COGS between $9 billion and $9.2 billion, including 1 point of FX headwind. We expect operating expenses of $9.1 billion to $9.2 billion, including 1 point of FX headwind. Given the opportunity ahead of us and our execution to date, we will continue to invest in intelligent cloud, intelligent edge, AI and our sales teams to drive sustainable top-line growth.
Other income and expense should be approximately $350 million as we continue to take gains in our equities portfolio and earn dividend and interest income. This is lower than we previously expected, reflecting the impact of rising interest rates on our fixed income portfolio.
Now, a few comments on the fiscal year. First, given our outperformance in the first half of the year, we are now ahead of our previous expectation for full-year gross margin. We are now trending to be roughly flat year-over-year including LinkedIn. Second, we still expect full year operating expenses, including LinkedIn, between $36.4 billion and $36.7 billion. We are confident in this investment, given our significant growth opportunities, consistent execution and strong competitive position.
Third, on operating margin we are again trending ahead of our previous guidance. We now expect company operating margin, including LinkedIn, to be slightly up year-over-year. Excluding LinkedIn, company operating margin should improve by more than a point.
Fourth, tax rate. Based on our current understanding of the recently enacted tax law, we now expect our effective tax rate for H2 to be 16%, plus or minus 2 points. For FY 2019, we expect our full-year effective tax rate to be slightly below the new U.S. corporate tax rate of 21%, due to the impact of tax law provisions effective for us July 1, 2018.
We will continue to have quarterly variability based on the mix of service and license revenue, geographic mix of revenue and the timing of equity vest.
Finally, we remain consistent in our ongoing commitment to capital return. As always, we believe the highest shareholder value is created first through organic and inorganic investment to pursue the significant market opportunities ahead and are proud of our resource allocation changes and the results.
And, we've been focused on capital return through both dividends and share repurchase as a key part of our commitment to total shareholder return for many years. With the recent tax reform, we can continue that commitment without the need to access the capital markets.
Before turning to Q&A, I have one special thank you. Chris Suh is moving to a new role as the senior finance leader of our Azure and Server business. On behalf of the company, thank you for your significant impact on Investor Relations for the past five years. And I'd like to welcome Mike Spencer, the former finance leader of our Office 365 business, as the new Head of Investor Relations. We look forward to having you lead the team.
Now, Chris, let's go to Q&A.
Chris Suh
Thanks, Amy. We'll now move to the Q&A. Ria, can you please repeat your instructions?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Karl Keirstead
Thanks very much and congratulations on the results. So relative to your guidance, over half the beat this quarter came in the Intelligent Cloud segment. So I wouldn't mind digging in there a little bit. And it wasn't just the amazing Azure performance. Your on-prem server product business accelerated despite the cautious commentary about a tough comp on the last call.
Even Enterprise Services was plus-3% instead of flat. And your guide actually suggests that that goodness in Intelligent Cloud should continue next quarter, despite actually a way tougher comp. So I'm just curious, Amy or Satya, if there are any threads that you can weave through this Intelligent Cloud outperformance, if you saw any broader increase in enterprise spend in the December quarter. Any change in behavior or is all of this goodness a little bit more Microsoft-specific? Amy, you called out IT spending signal, so I'm guessing maybe a little bit was macro. Thank you.
Satya Nadella
Thanks, Karl. Let me start and, Amy, you can add. I mean, for me it all comes down to really having an architectural advantage on what is a new secular trend. So when we think about the Intelligent Cloud and the Intelligent Edge, and then bring that to the Azure business, you can see it at each layer. When it comes to infrastructure, we're the only cloud provider that provides true hybrid cloud computing with Azure and Azure Stack.
When it comes to the data tier, we have real uniqueness. Take something like Cosmos DB. It's the only planet-scale database, that's multi-model, supports these new programming models of server-less and event-driven programming. Take SQL, what we are seeing in terms of SQL growth, in terms of Azure DB, as well as SQL server and SQL server on Linux, that's again addressing the customer needs.
There are new workloads that are being born, that require both the cloud and the edge, IoT being a great example of that. And especially when you take that in combination with AI, again, you train on the cloud and you score on the edge. That's a real competitive advantage. We have everything from sort of the lifecycle management of how these models get created and deployed, and so on.
So I think that's what you're seeing. There will be variability quarter to quarter. There will be mix differences. But overall, when I look at what is it that we need to get done is innovate on what is a fundamental architectural advantage to where the world is going.
Amy Hood
And I would say, Karl, a couple of things. We've been investing here both in engineering to land the differentiation that Satya just talked about in sales resources and then continuing to invest in technical sales resources that can help our customers be successful in these deployments. I actually think you're continuing to see the impact of those investments growing in time and growing in expertise.
And so, I feel encouraged both by the technical differentiation, but also the return on the investments we've made here, that lead us to have good amount of confidence that you do see in the guide in Q3. And yes, you're right, we do have a tougher comparable, particularly on-prem in Q3, which is correct.
Karl Keirstead
Okay, thank you both.
Satya Nadella
Thank you, Karl.
Chris Suh
Thanks, Karl. We'll move to next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Keith Eric Weiss
Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question. Very - again, a really solid quarter. And, Chris, it's been great working with you. Sorry to see you go from this role.
I'll ask my questions. One question for Satya, and starting a little bit narrow, maybe running off from there. Gaming in the quarter seems to have - had a good quarter for gaming with Xbox launch. But more broadly, there are some murmurings out there about Xbox falling behind PlayStation. If you look at the sort of the bases of those two consoles, there are murmurings about not having enough kind of exclusive games on the console.
I know you sort of mixed up leadership a little bit there. How do you feel about your positioning in gaming from a narrow focus? And then more broadly, how are you guys feeling about your position in the home if you will. When I go home, I'm talking to Alexa. I'm not talking to Cortana. Is that something that you're comfortable with where we are today? Is that something we should see improving on a going forward basis?
Satya Nadella
Thanks, Keith. So let me take both of those questions. So on gaming, we feel good about Xbox One X, the premium console launch. We also feel good about the volume we got for Xbox One S, because we always wanted that halo effect of the premium console driving even the lower-end console, because that creates the sockets for gaming for us.
But our real strategy going forward is not only to do great work on the console, but to complement that with the work we're doing on the PC. PC gaming is a growth market. And so, therefore you see us, whether it's our subscription offer, whether it's our streaming efforts that are increasingly bringing the console plus PC together.
And then, not stopping there, but going to other devices, for example mobile. Minecraft on mobile we just launched in fact in the last quarter in China. We are seeing tremendous growth of Minecraft expansion on mobile platform in China. So overall, you will see us do good work on the console, we'll compete there. But more importantly, we have a much more broader gaming view in terms of what value we can add with our subscription services streaming services across all devices.
And one other point I think I made in my remarks earlier is gaming also is a growth area for Azure. In other words, we have now increasing past services that we are going to reinforce on Azure and attract more game developers. Some of the know-how that we have from Xbox is not just about the Xbox, but it's going to help developers across the board. So that I think will also transcend or lead into even media companies. So we're very excited about some of what we can get out of our investments in gaming. So that's our focus on gaming.
In terms of Cortana and home, I think it's probably important. Although the question I'll ask is, you asked it narrowly, but my investments are much broader. In other words, I first start by saying let's make sure our best AI capability, whether it's speech, whether it's ultimately even image recognition and dialogue management, because right now most assistants are fairly dumb in terms of just doing one-turn dialogue, but where we're going to go is multi-turn dialogue and that requires real natural language understanding.
So all of those investments, for example, are available on Azure as Cognitive Services. I even referenced in my remarks how in healthcare people are using those to build bots and skills and agents. That's where we will make sure we do our best, building blocks and AI work. Of course, it will manifest for us with Cortana as an agent from Microsoft that has some special skills, especially around that crossover between work and life.
Most agents and their knowledge or smarts come from the data access they have. In our case, it's going to be about things that are there in Office 365. The people, places, things and how we reason about it and help users, whether they're at home or whether they're at work.
Lastly, even when it's comes to devices, we want to take an approach that brings all assistants. That's why we are working with Alexa, we would welcome it on our devices, because we believe in a world where our own assistant should be available everywhere and so should other assistants be available on our devices versus thinking that the end game here is about speaking, doing one-turn dialogues on one speaker in one home. That's just not our vision.
Keith Eric Weiss
Excellent.
Chris Suh
Thanks, Keith. We'll move to next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with [Ever AB] [ph]. Please proceed with your question.
Mark Moerdler
Thank you. Congrats first on the great quarter, and Chris, thanks and congratulations on the new position, so you'll be greatly successful. Satya, I'd like to ask you a question, can you give us a sense of what is the adoption of Azure in the U.S. versus International, not just in the revenue point of view. But in terms of the mix of premium workloads, types of workloads, et cetera? How should we think, where we are in that process?
Satya Nadella
I would say, the U.S. has been a lead market in general when it comes to the latest technology and architectural paradigm adoption, whether it'd like take something like AI or the higher-level services around data. We clearly see first things happening in U.S. and quickly followed by geographies like Germany and the UK. There are certain workloads like the IoT workload, where we do see very advanced action in countries like Germany, especially with the industrial customers in terms of smart factories, Japan.
But I think broadly, I don't see any difference than say, what we used to see or what we still see on our server or any other technology adoption curves. And they have differences in industry patterns, because different industries are strong in different parts of the globe. So - and then, they represent different use cases in terms of the components of Azure that get used.
Mark Moerdler
Thank you.
Chris Suh
Thanks, Mark. We'll take next question please, Ria.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Heather Bellini
Great. Thank you. Two questions. One, Amy, I guess you've been talking about and so is IR about the commercial bookings, where the expiry base was down over year-over-year - on a year-over-year basis. I am just wondering, if you look ahead to 2019, is there anything you could share with us about the size of the expiry base in that period just so we can think about it? I know, you don't give guidance that far out, but just as we start to think about - thinking about further out growth.
And then, I guess the other question would be - you mentioned better IT spending. But just also given the significant savings companies in the U.S. are going to be seeing due to lower tax bills. Is there any early feedback from partners or customers about the rate that this might be reinvested back into IT spending and digitization? Thank you.
Amy Hood
Thanks, Heather. In general, fiscal 2019 will have a higher base than fiscal 2018, just as you start to think through the impacts on bookings for the next year. And as we talked about, Q3 has that same attribute, it's higher than it was a year-ago Q2. The reason we called it out, obviously, because it was such an outlier. And if you look back three years sort of how this EA expiry base works, our performance this quarter was really strong compared to three years ago. So I feel great about our sales execution especially in terms of growing the recapture rate at accounts.
To the question on the demand signals we're seeing in the U.S. in particular - I think, it is quite early, but as we said the U.S. has been a good market for us and a strong market for us for a good period of time, and it was again in Q2, as we noted. And I think, we are optimistic as we look to H2, when we see the signals we're seeing in the market whether it's PCs, server or the cloud demand.
Heather Bellini
Thank you.
Chris Suh
Thank you, Heather. Thanks. We'll take next question, Ria.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
Philip Winslow
Hi. Thanks, guys, for taking my question and congrats not only just on the income statement, but also obviously the balance sheet where, obviously, the commercial, it was only down 5% versus your guided 7%, so congrats there. The - my focus is actually on the commercial side, but specifically on Office. Obviously, your Office 365 revenue continues to outpace seat growth there.
We've talked about that in the past with pricing, but if I just look at also overall Office on the commercial side, up 10%, same as Q1, when you all think about just going forward just the mix of those two, obviously, the on-prem business is still declining in the high-teens, and then Office 365 growing rapidly. How do you think about just the blended growth of Office commercial and the puts and takes there?
Amy Hood
This is one, where I tend to when I think about that 10% number, it really is the same way I think about Office 365. Our goal and I think the real opportunity that remains with Office 365 and Microsoft 365 going forward, is our ability to continue to grow the installed base, and to also continue to grow our ARPU. The combination of those two things and the opportunity we see is the reason in the sales re-org that we did in July, we continue to put resources and sales resources behind collaboration and communication, and so many of the important workloads that allow us to give great value to customers.
And you've even started to see it this quarter as you're pointing out, Phil. We saw a little bit more impact of E5 this quarter in ARPU than we have been seeing. It's been in the market a while, we're seeing that momentum, the value all up of E5 not just from an Office perspective, but from a Microsoft 365 perspective with security and management as well as some of the newer products that are getting some strong adoption like Teams.
I think we feel really good about where we are, and the value and our opportunity both from small business up to the large enterprise from first line workers to do all of these - do all these things and continue to execute well. So the guide certainly implies that continued optimism.
Philip Winslow
Awesome. Thanks, guys.
Chris Suh
Thanks, Phil. We'll take - go to the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.
Raimo Lenschow
Thanks for taking my question, and all the best for you, Chris. I just wanted to double click on the productivity gaze you see in the Cloud especially on Azure. Can you talk a little bit about the [drivers there] [ph]? I know one is that your build-out pattern was different than some of your competitors, so you're kind of filling capacity. But also talk a little bit about what you see in terms of how you are delivering the services in Azure and how that's evolving? Thank you.
Satya Nadella
I mean, overall we did take an approach that we want to make sure we meet the real world needs across the globe. And we'll continue to do so, when we look at our CapEx spend we want to make sure that the data center regions meet the needs of our customers globally across both consumer workloads and enterprise workloads, where real data sovereignty requirements and speed-of-light issues are already relevant.
Having said that, the way it fills up is by the value-add that we can do. So that's why the mix of these higher level services especially around data and AI is definitely driving a lot more consumption of our higher level services. And even something like IoT, they're not just at the consumption meters, but they're also got SaaS like qualities to them.
So I feel very, very good about ultimately having innovation that drives both the consumption of more higher level services and then also making sure that we are available in all parts of the world, where the demand is going to spread to, because we are in the very, very early innings of essentially this new cloud growth, and there's only going to be increasing demand as there's more digitization of every city, every factory, every hospital and so on. So I think we have a long way to go to still fill up.
Amy Hood
And I would say, the way to think about that and you see it in the gross margin percentages and the improvements we've continued to see is the Azure premium revenue growth exceeding the overall revenue growth that actually is a benefit to the gross margin rate. Then again all the work we have done through the supply chain. So while we have a signal come in, you see a very quick turn from demand signal to us having servers in place and ready to be utilized very quickly. That work continues and the team has done a really nice job.
And then as well software improvements, they continue to go on to increase our ability to run more or less. Those taken together continue to show gross margin improvement.
Raimo Lenschow
Thank you.
Chris Suh
Thanks, Reimo. We will go to the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company. Please proceed.
Gregg Moskowitz
Okay. Thank you very much. Amy, I'd like to follow-up on Heather's question, because it's really difficult to grow commercial bookings by mid-single-digits constant currency in the face of 20% or so declining EA expirations. And so I'm wondering, looking beyond this quarter, if you could expand on how commercial bookings growth ex-renewals is trending? And in other words, are you getting more separation, if you will between reported growth and growth excluding renewal activity?
Amy Hood
Let me take a shot. The way I think about bookings growth every quarter, as you tend to look at a couple of things. And I would say, I start with renewals, not just that we renew the contract but how many new products, new services did we add to that contract? Do we expand our footprint, our percentage of the IT budget at a customer? Do they rely on us for more products and more services? This quarter is a good example of that happening.
And if you think about the connection to why that happens it's not just a terrific engineering work that we've done in product value, it's also the investments that we've made to put resources and some of these larger accounts to continue to add new workloads that are only possible in the cloud and we've added resources that we're seeing the revenue get recaptured in that way. So that I think feels very good from a resource allocation and return perspective.
And so, then the next component obviously is being able to grow just brand new accounts. Are we growing customer bases? Are we penetrating segments and you also saw that in the quarter. So at a high-level you can either sort of add more, expand your footprint or you get to add a new customer and both of those are motions that we focus on and I feel good about our execution.
I think there is and you'll see that dynamic, so if the expiry base is a little bigger, you'd expect obviously a number bigger than that on the booking side and when the expiry rates' growth - it's really about the delta between the two as you know. And our execution this quarter was quite good. But it's come from sustainable investment and our sales, technical resources, and in the engineering to deliver a differentiated value at the customer.
Gregg Moskowitz
Very helpful, thank you.
Chris Suh
Thanks, Gregg. We'll take the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
Kash Rangan
Hi, Satya, my nine-year-old kid insists that the Minecraft is the best thing for his brain development. So whatever it is congratulations. But serious question is with cash repatriation obviously Microsoft has the ability to bring back a lot of money. I'm wondering what the priorities of the company are with respect to doing a large strategic deal or not so perhaps, and perhaps even share repurchases and dividends. Clearly, this is once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and there is a lot that can be done. Curious, how you think about this. Thank you so much.
Satya Nadella
I'll actually let Amy.
Amy Hood
Yeah, why don't I take this. Number one I would say, we have - when we have seen an opportunity to invest, we have not really waited for tax reform to do that. Our opportunity, the TAM, really the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity is really the technical transition and digital transformation that's occurring now. And so, we've invested to make that happen. We made acquisitions when they made sense. We have used the capital markets and the debt market to fund those to make sure that we made the right investments to grow our business.
And so for us, we also didn't wait when we thought about capital return. Even this quarter, we returned almost all of our free cash flow generation in dividends and share repurchase. And we've been on that path for a number of years. Now, that being said, I am pleased obviously, to be able to access the cash more easily and not has to go through the debt market to be able to make these choices. Whether it's investment in ourselves, and the returns you've seen in this quarter in revenue growth, whether it's the acquisitions like LinkedIn that are performing better than we expected. And I think today, we would even say it's a more strategic asset than we even maybe thought a year ago in terms of the power of it to add to our graph and our understanding.
And then, be able to return capital. So for me, while I appreciate the spirit behind the question, for us we have felt a necessity to do that for years, as a part of total shareholder return and our commitment to do that. And I think we've done a good job. And I'm proud of what we've done, and I'm proud and excited for what we can continue to do.
Kash Rangan
Terrific. Thanks so much.
Chris Suh
Thank you, Kash. We'll take one - the next question, please. We'll move to the next question please, Ria.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nemeroff with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Michael Nemeroff
Well, thanks for taking my question. This one's for Amy, about the Office 365 commercial. Are there any limitations other than storage-related workloads that would limit Office 365 commercial gross margin from reaching, say, 80% over time? And what are some of the current limitations on that gross margin that you'd think could be improved upon, for that to work higher than 70% over time? Thanks.
Amy Hood
Thanks. You're right. In general, workloads like Exchange and increasingly SharePoint, which we have seen some really great encouraging numbers on usage of SharePoint in our Office 365 commercial base. Those do have storage requirements. And so, you're absolutely right. They are slightly different than many of the very high-level SaaS workloads that you see. But we still do have room, which I think is really the core of the question.
We still have some room to improve that Office 365 commercial gross margin, from the new workloads we've added, which have even more of this pure SaaS like workloads, and aside from Office, in that same segment is Dynamics who - or LinkedIn, which both have those SaaS like margins, and can, and we see opportunity to both improve those as well.
So I don't think there's necessarily a level, but there's certainly room even within these storage-heavy workloads.
Satya Nadella
I mean, I'd just add, this is not specifically to the gross margin question, but the expansive nature Microsoft 365, first of all, we think of it all up in that context. Amy already referenced how small businesses that perhaps never did advanced workloads are now able to do so. Emerging markets that never did are able to do so.
So first of all, whether it's - on firstline workers, we never had any solutions for firstline workers. So there is a market expansion in terms of users and the sophistication of the workloads that they can use or the higher-level services. The other thing is Office by itself. You talked about storage. It's an interesting question to say, what is being stored in Office, in meetings going forward, at home office or people calling in, things like mixed-reality being used in meetings.
It's very different. It's not about you sitting in front of Word and entering text. That's not the full limit of Office. Office is about any people collaborating in voice or in - with even computer vision and many other ways that I think collaboration will happen. So we have a very expansive view, much like Azure for infrastructure, and data and AI. In terms of human activity that gets digitized at work and at home is something that we're going after with Microsoft 365.
Michael Nemeroff
Thanks for taking my questions.
Chris Suh
Thanks, Michael. We'll go down to our last question now please, Ria, if we can move to it.
Operator
Thank you. Our last question comes from line of Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.
Alex Zukin
Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Satya, I wanted to ask you about Azure Stack adoption. You mentioned it was ahead of your expectations on the call. And, I guess, if you think about your early traction with service providers and how you're empowering them to build these Azure capable datacenters globally, maybe longer term how should we think about the impact of this on Azure hyper-growth durability beyond fiscal 2018 as you scale?
Satya Nadella
See, our overall vision for how computing evolves is that it's going to be more distributed, not less distributed. Let's just take for example what's happening in a factory. In a factory, one thing that is secular is that they're putting lots and lots of more sensors. Lot of the sensors today are in fact rendezvousing some of that data straight to the cloud.
As you do more of that, what happens is you need to - and then you start doing sensor fusion, which is your multiple sensors that you want to be able to fuse and take action. The speed of light gets in the way. So they want local compute. And so, in order to have that local compute in some of these factories with millions of sensors, you may in fact need Azure Stack. So it's not just about old workloads and service providers and essentially hybrid computing as we understand it.
When I think about hybrid computing at least in the fullness of time, it's more the future of distributed computing, where there is a cloud, there is an edge. And even the edge is not just one single edge. But it's got a topology associated with it, going all the way to the sensors, whether it's at home, whether it's in a hospital, whether it's in a factory.
So that's where we're going to end up, which is a true distributed computing fabric that the world needs in order to be digitally transformed. How - and quarter to quarter will there be volatility, shifts, changes, that's all going to be the case. But we see the pattern emerge pretty clearly in terms of where we need to go.

Greetings, and welcome to the First Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Microsoft Corporation Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to turn the call over to Chris Suh, General Manager of Investor Relations. Chris, please proceed.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Jesse. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary.
On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call. As a reminder, this is the first quarter we're reporting our results under the new revenue standard, ASC 606. As we detailed during a conference call we hosted on August 3, the adoption of the standard had several impacts, but most materially, the revenue recognition of Windows 10 OEM licenses and the license component of on-premises annuity contracts.
As we discuss our Q1 results and share our outlook on the call, please keep in mind the following: first, the new standard allows us to simplify the communication of our results by eliminating the non-GAAP revenue reporting; second, there's no change in customer billings, cash flows or revenue recognition for our cloud services, hardware, enterprise services and advertising businesses; and lastly, the quarterly seasonality of our revenue within a given year does change, and we may experience higher quarterly volatility as well.
The prior periods we will reference on this call and in the earnings materials on our IR website have been restated to reflect adoption of this new standard. During our August 3 call, we also translated our outlook for Q1 into the new standard, and all references to expectations on this call refer to that translated guidance. You can find additional information on this accounting change located on the IR website.
All growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We'll also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website until October 26, 2018.
During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Thank you, Chris, and thanks to everyone on the phone for joining. We are off to a very strong start in FY 2018, delivering double digit top and bottom line growth and exceeding $20 billion in commercial cloud ARR, outpacing the goal we set just over two years ago. I'm proud of our team's work behind these results that spanned all of our segments.
We now have 120 million monthly active users of Office 365 Commercial. We have more than 530 million LinkedIn members. Dynamics 365 customers grew 40% year over year. Azure Compute usage more than doubled this quarter and revenue grew 90%, and Windows 10 Commercial monthly active devices grew 90% year over year. These results reflect our accelerating innovation as well as increased usage and engagement across all businesses as customers continue to choose Microsoft to help them transform.
Amy will cover our financial results in more detail, but today I wanted to talk about the key areas of innovation and opportunity for growth in 2018 and beyond. Our focus is on bringing our technology and products together into experiences and solutions that deliver new value for customers by galvanizing around five key solution areas.
First, top of mind for every CEO is empowering their own employees for the modern workplace. Microsoft 365 is our core offering to address this $500 billion-plus market. We are bringing together Office 365, Windows 10 and Enterprise Mobility + Security as a complete integrated solution for organizations of all sizes. It represents a profound shift in the way we design, build and deliver our productivity solutions, moving to a people-centered approach, spanning all their devices to unlock creativity and inspire teamwork while simplifying security and management.
This past quarter, we launched a wave of innovation across Microsoft 365. The Windows 10 Fall Creators Update empowers people with new AI-first interfaces, ranging from voice-activated commands through Cortana, inking, immersive 3D content storytelling and Mixed Reality experiences.
Cloud sharing and co-authoring experiences are now natively enabled with OneDrive files on demand. We are making Windows 10 more accessible to everyone with new features like the eye control, which gives people the ability to operate a PC using just their eyes.
You'll see a great lineup of Windows 10 devices this holiday from the new Surface Book 2 to a vibrant range of devices from our OEM partners.
This month, we also introduced Windows Mixed Reality broadly. Mixed Reality, which is a voice, gaze and gesture interface, will fundamentally change the way people and teams collaborate. Our work with Ford is a great example of this promise. Ford's designers are using Mixed Reality to blend 3D holograms digitally with models and physical production vehicles, allowing them to experiment and iterate on design much more quickly.
HoloLens, Windows VR headsets and Microsoft 365 enable any customer to blend physical and digital worlds across devices, empowering people to collaborate in the same shared experience from anywhere in the world. AI is infused across Microsoft 365 in a myriad of helpful ways, making it easier for people to create high-impact presentations and documents, automate routine tasks and search and discover people and content in highly personalized and relevant ways.
Beyond new AI capabilities in PowerPoint, Word, OneNote, SharePoint, we're enabling AI-first workloads like Bing and Cortana using the Microsoft Graph. Soon, you'll be able to search not only the public Internet but also corporate intranet sites, line of business applications and people with Bing for Business, now in private preview. With Cortana, you'll be able to query your calendar and automate tasks like scheduling a meeting or replying to an e-mail using just your voice.
Microsoft Teams is core to our vision for the modern workplace as a digital hub for teamwork, bringing together conversations, meetings and content into a single canvas. We are integrating AI and cognitive services to make meetings more productive for users today and longer-term.
Lastly, Microsoft 365 connects users, devices and SaaS applications into a single control plane to simplify IT management while providing comprehensive security across the entire digital estate. Today's sophisticated threats require AI-based security approaches. Using the Microsoft Intelligent Security Graph, we process billions of signals to detect and remediate threats. New conditional access capabilities evaluate risk in real-time based on the user's account, device and application and physical location. Our leading-edge security and management capabilities are just one reason customers trust Microsoft 365 for their modern workplace needs.
Now, I'll turn to LinkedIn and our business applications. From the outset, the priority one was to ensure that LinkedIn, on its own, accelerate its mission and growth while retaining its culture as part of Microsoft. Nearly one year in, we are ahead of plan with LinkedIn contributing positively to EPS ex-purchase accounting in fiscal 2018.
Second, we're seeing record levels of engagement. LinkedIn is on target to surpass 21 billion sessions this calendar year and has seen its fourth consecutive quarter of 20%-plus sessions growth. Engagement across the platform is strong, with 65% year-over-year growth in jobs, visitors across mobile and desktop, 60% growth in feed update views and nearly 40% growth in messages sent, driven by more ubiquitous messaging.
Third, innovation and execution are accelerating in both the business and in the product integrations across Microsoft, with a positive reception to native video, career advice marketplace and this week's launch of smart reply messaging. LinkedIn profile integration in Office 365 delivers rich people insights from both the LinkedIn Graph and the Microsoft Graph. The Microsoft Relationship Sales solution brings together LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Microsoft Dynamics to transform business-to-business sales through social selling.
Dynamics 365 for talent with LinkedIn Recruiter and Learning gives HR professionals a complete solution to compete in the talent marketplace. You'll see more product integration in fiscal 2018 as we continue to accelerate our innovation to connect the world's leading professional cloud with the world's leading professional network.
Now, I'll turn to two areas of our hybrid cloud value proposition, applications and infrastructure and data and AI. We've been focused on addressing the real-world needs of customers with our differentiated approach to the cloud, architecting for hybrid consistency, developer productivity, AI capabilities and trusted security and compliance. Moreover, customers are choosing the Microsoft Cloud for its operational consistency, productivity and security that spans the entire digital estate, inclusive of Windows 10 security and management, Dynamics 365, Enterprise Mobility + Security and Azure.
Let's double-click on hybrid. To support the emerging intelligent cloud, intelligent edge application pattern, you need a consistent stack across the public cloud and the edge. Merely providing colocation services or connectivity between on-premise data centers and the public cloud is not sufficient to meet customer needs. You need consistency across the development environment, operating models and technology stacks.
Azure provides this consistency across the entire stack, inclusive of identity, data, app platform, security and management at the edge and in the cloud. Our hybrid cloud is one of the reasons nearly every Fortune 500 company has chosen to partner with Microsoft. Costco recently chose Azure as its hybrid cloud platform, and we are excited to partner with them on their digital transformation.
Core currency of any business going forward will be the ability to convert their data into AI that drives competitive advantage. Azure SQL DB makes it possible for customers to take SQL Server from their on-premise data center to a fully-managed instance in the cloud with no code changes. SQL 2017 is now broadly available on Windows, Linux, Docker containers, with everything built in, including the ability to run AI compute close to the data with Python or R.
Azure Cosmos DB is the first globally distributed multimodal database that enables developers to write apps for IoT and other event-based serverless applications. We're accelerating our innovation to help every developer be an AI developer with approachable new tools from Azure Machine Learning Studio for creating simple ML models to powerful Azure Machine Learning Workbench for the most advanced AI modeling and data science. We continue to enhance our cognitive services to give every enterprise powerful building blocks to create their own AI applications.
Finally, we continue to invest in making Azure the most trusted cloud with AI-based security built in. Azure confidential computing enables encryption of in-use data to ensure that information is always under customer control, a first for any public cloud.
Our ongoing data center expansion brings Azure to 42 regions globally, more than any other cloud provider and 69 compliance offerings and the most comprehensive compliance coverage in the industry. And new Azure availability zones provide new levels of resiliency for high-availability apps within a region and across regions.
Now, let me turn to our last solution area, Gaming. We are mobilizing to pursue our expansive opportunity in the $100 billion-plus gaming industry, broadening our approach to how we think about gaming end-to-end, from the way games are created and distributed to how they are played and viewed.
We will continue to connect our Gaming assets across PC, console and mobile and work to grow and engage the more than 53 million Xbox Live member network more deeply and frequently with new services like Game Pass and Mixer. And we are a few days away from launching the Xbox One X, the most technically advanced and powerful console ever built.
Moreover, we have high expectations for our Gaming business to bring more people to more Microsoft experiences and broaden our engagement and usage scenarios. This means fundamentally rethinking how we measure progress in Gaming. While we continue to innovate across the console, PC and Xbox Live services, we see substantial additional opportunities across e-sports and streaming.
At 20% this quarter, our software and services revenue growth reflects the early-stage potential of this larger opportunity. We also see the opportunity to empower developers who work on console, PC and mobile games to use our cloud infrastructure and services to enhance their game play and community.
Gaming pushes the boundaries of hardware and software innovation, with some of the most CPU and GPU-intensive applications and content, giving us a huge opportunity in the cloud. As one example, PUBG Corp., with the hit game PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS, is not only partnering to make Xbox the exclusive console at launch but is also running on Azure.
In closing, across the company, we are mobilizing to pursue our five core customer solution areas. We are partnering deeply with our customers so that our new technologies and innovations can help them digitally transform, grow and thrive.
Now I'll hand it over to Amy to walk through this quarter's results in more detail and share our outlook, and I look forward to rejoining you for the questions.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. This quarter revenue was $24.5 billion, up 12% and 11% in constant currency with better than expected performance across all segments. Gross margin increased 15%. Operating income increased 15% and earnings per share was $0.84, increasing 17%. Our strong start to the fiscal year with double digit top and bottom line growth is a result of our consistent execution and ongoing investment in product innovation and sales capacity.
At a company level, LinkedIn contributed approximately 5 points of revenue and gross margin growth and had a 4 point drag on operating income. Excluding the cost of amortization of acquired intangibles, LinkedIn contributed $78 million to operating income. We are confidently ahead of our original financial commitment for LinkedIn. We now expect LinkedIn, ex-purchase accounting, to be accretive to EPS this fiscal year.
Our results were in line with macroeconomic trends, with better than expected performance from large markets like France, Japan and the UK and stabilization in markets like Brazil and Russia. Our sales team and partners delivered strong commercial results this quarter. Multiyear commitments from customers contributed to an 89% annuity mix. On a roughly flat dollar volume of EA expirations, we grew commercial bookings 14% and 9% in constant currency.
Commercial unearned revenue came in higher than we expected at $21.5 billion, primarily from higher Software Assurance billings and FX benefit.
Our commercial cloud business had another quarter of robust revenue growth and material gross margin improvement. Revenue exceeded $5 billion this quarter, growing 56% year over year and gross margin increased 8 points to 57%, with improvement in each cloud service, most notably in Azure.
Our company gross margin was 66%, up 2 points from prior year as sales mix of higher-margin products and services, along with improving cloud margins, more than offset the impact of the growing cloud mix of revenue and LinkedIn amortization cost.
The FX impact of a weaker than expected U.S. dollar increased total company revenue growth by 1 point. At the segment level, FX had minimal impact on Productivity and Business Processes and increased revenue growth in both Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing by 1 point. FX added 1 point of growth to operating expenses this quarter, which grew 16% and 15% in constant currency. LinkedIn contributed 14 points of growth, including $154 million of amortization of acquired intangible expense.
Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes segment grew 28%, also 28% in constant currency, to $8.2 billion with better than expected results due to FX as well as Office commercial, consumer and LinkedIn.
LinkedIn contributed 18 points of growth. Office commercial revenue increased 10% as revenue mix continued to shift to Office 365 Commercial. Office 365 Commercial revenue grew 42% from strong installed base growth and ARPU expansion.
Companies like Lowe's and Devon Energy chose Office 365 to connect their employees and empower them in the modern workplace. And with our channel partners, we added on average more than 50,000 small and medium business customers each month, a trend we have sustained for more than 3 years.
Office 365 Commercial seat growth was up 1 point sequentially to 32% and declined 8 points year over year. We do expect that year over year trend to continue, given the increasing size of the base.
Office consumer revenue increased 12% or 10% in constant currency, driven by recurring subscription revenue and growth in our subscriber base, now at 28 million. Our Dynamics business grew 13% and 12% in constant currency, driven by the revenue mix shift to Dynamics 365. Customers like the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the Seattle Seahawks have adopted Dynamics 365 to modernize their business processes. Dynamics 365 grew 69%, same in constant currency, with continued installed base and ARPU growth.
LinkedIn revenue for the quarter was approximately $1.1 billion, a bit better than we expected. Post-acquisition sales execution has been strong with record levels of user engagement. This quarter, LinkedIn sessions again grew more than 20%.
Segment gross margin dollars grew 25% and 24% in constant currency with 15 points of contribution from LinkedIn, including $218 million of amortization. Gross margin percentage declined due to the impact of LinkedIn-related amortization.
Operating expenses grew 54% and 53% in constant currency with 49 points from LinkedIn, including $154 million of amortization expense. Operating income increased 3% and 4% in constant currency, with 10 points of negative impact from LinkedIn.
The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered $6.9 billion in revenue, growing 14% and 13% in constant currency with better than expected performance driven by hybrid cloud results as well as FX.
Server products and cloud services revenue grew 17%, also 17% in constant currency, with another quarter of double digit annuity revenue growth. Azure revenue grew 90% and 89% in constant currency and Azure premium revenue grew triple digits for the 13th consecutive quarter.
Our unique ability to provide a distributed hybrid model for the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge continues to attract customers to Microsoft. Symantec, the industry's largest security vendor, has adopted a company-wide hybrid strategy with Azure, including delivery of its Norton consumer products to a global community of more than 50 million people. And financial services firms like Bank of America, TD Bank and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation are all using Azure and its data services to improve customer experiences.
Enterprise Services revenue grew 1% and was flat in constant currency as premium support services growth offset declines in custom support agreements for Windows Server 2003. Segment gross margin dollars grew 10%, the same in constant currency, and segment gross margin percentage declined due to the increasing cloud revenue mix and lower Enterprise Services margins, partially offset by material improvement in Azure gross margin.
This quarter, operating expenses grew 3%, or 2% in constant currency, from ongoing investments in sales capacity and engineering. Operating income increased 20%, the same in constant currency.
Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue from this segment was $9.4 billion with FX as well as each core business contributing to the segment's better than expected results. Excluding phone, revenue grew 3%, the same in constant currency. Both the commercial and the consumer PC markets were better than we expected, contributing to OEM revenue growth of 4%. OEM Pro revenue grew 7%, ahead of the commercial PC market from a higher mix of premium SKUs and a couple points from timing of license purchases. We continued to see Windows 10 deployment cycles drive commercial customer hardware demand.
OEM non-Pro revenue was down 1%, in line with the consumer PC market and reflecting healthier conditions in key markets like Brazil and Russia. Inventory levels were in the normal range for a pre-holiday quarter. Windows commercial products and services grew 7% and 6% in constant currency, mainly driven by seat growth. We continue to see enterprise customer momentum, with Coca-Cola Company, Her Majesty Revenue & Customs and Rogers Communications choosing Windows 10 for its intelligent security features and advanced management capabilities.
Patent licensing declined this quarter, primarily due to a one-time impact of IP deals signed in the prior year. Search revenue ex TAC grew 15%, the same in constant currency, from higher revenue per search and stronger than expected performance from volume. Our online businesses showed healthy improvement in revenue growth and profitability as we realized the benefits of scale. Our Surface business grew 12% and 11% in constant currency, driven by sales of the new Surface Laptop in both the commercial and consumer segments. We continued to see solid execution through the product lifecycle transition between Pro 4 and our new devices.
Gaming revenue grew 1% and was flat in constant currency as Xbox software and services growth offset declines in hardware. Software and services revenue grew 21%, or 20% in constant currency, driven by continued growth in monetization. Our engaged user base grew 13% to 53 million monthly active users across Xbox One, Windows 10 and mobile platforms. Additionally, new services like Game Pass and Mixer, which create more opportunity for engagement and monetization, showed encouraging early results.
Segment gross margin dollars increased 10%. Gross margin percentage increased primarily due to sales mix shift to higher-margin products and services. Operating expenses declined 1%, or 2% in constant currency, from lower Windows and Gaming marketing spend and our last full quarter of significant benefit from phone savings. Operating income grew 26%, the same in constant currency.
Now back to our overall company results. This quarter, we invested approximately $2.7 billion in capital expenditures, including finance leases, down sequentially and lower than originally planned mainly due to quarter to quarter volatility. Cash paid for property and equipment was approximately $2.1 billion. Our significant capital investment continues, mainly based on customer demand and usage signal, and the teams remain focused on gross margin improvement as they deploy services globally to meet that demand signal.
Free cash flow grew 10% from operating cash flow growth of 8%. As a reminder, in the prior year, we had $1.3 billion in unsettled cash equivalent positions that reversed the following quarter. Excluding this amount, free cash flow increased 27% from higher customer collections following strong billings growth and working capital improvements in the hardware business, primarily driven by our exit from the phone business.
Other income and expense was $276 million, a little more than planned, as we continued to see opportunities in the equity market to realize gains throughout the quarter. Our effective tax rate was 18%, 1 point lower than we expected, primarily due to geographic mix of revenue. This quarter, we returned $4.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchasers.
Now, let's turn to the Q2 outlook. First on FX. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by 1 point, COGS growth by 1 point and OpEx growth by 2 points. Our commercial business should remain healthy, with solid renewal execution and increasing customer demand for our hybrid cloud services and new cloud solutions like Microsoft 365.
Turning to commercial bookings. As you know, the underlying dollar volume of EA expirations impacts commercial bookings growth. For the full year, total expirations will be up slightly, but Q2 expiration dollar volume will be down roughly 20%, impacting our Q2 commercial bookings growth. We expect commercial unearned revenue to be down approximately 7% sequentially, reflecting normal seasonality. We remain committed to material improvement in our commercial cloud gross margin percentage.
Margin performance is variable quarter to quarter, driven by revenue mix and seasonality, as well as the timing of infrastructure spend. We expect continued year-over-year margin improvement and sequential trends consistent with prior years.
Next to CapEx. We will increase our capital investment to meet growing demand and capacity needs. And on accrual dollar basis, we expect a sequential dollar increase next quarter.
In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $8.75 billion and $8.95 billion. Office 365 commercial growth will continue to outpace the transactional decline. We expect a more moderate rate of growth in our Office consumer business, given the prior-year comparable. In Dynamics, we expect continued double-digit revenue growth, driven by the shift to Dynamics 365. And we expect approximately $1.2 billion of LinkedIn revenue, reflecting continued strong sales execution by the team.
In Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $7.35 billion and $7.55 billion, with another quarter of double-digit revenue growth across server products and cloud services. As a reminder, starting in Q2 of last year, the launch of Windows Server 2016 drove strong on-premises performance, resulting in 6% constant currency growth for server products. This comparable will impact the segment's year-over-year growth rate. We expect Enterprise Services revenue growth to be similar to last quarter, driven by Premier Support Services offsetting declines in custom support agreements.
In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $11.7 billion to $12.1 billion. First on Windows. OEM revenue should track roughly in-line with the overall PC market. Specifically, OEM Pro revenue growth should be more aligned to the commercial PC market, normalizing for a couple points of growth from the timing of licensing purchasing in the first quarter.
Next, Devices. In Surface, we expect revenue to be up slightly from Q1 as we continue to transition to the new Surface Pro, ramp Surface Laptop and launch the Surface Book 2. Also in November of last year, we closed the sale of our feature phone business, so this will be the final quarter of revenue comparability impacted by the phone. We expect double-digit revenue growth in search ex-TAC, reflecting continued strong performance in both rate and volume.
And finally, Gaming. We expect revenue growth from the launch of the Xbox One console and continued healthy growth of software and services revenue. In Q2, the higher mix of Gaming hardware revenue will significantly impact both the segment and company gross margin percentages.
We expect COGS between $11 billion and $11.2 billion, in the normal range for a holiday quarter with new device launches and including 1 point of FX headwind. This includes approximately $400 million of LinkedIn COGS, of which $220 million is related to amortization expense.
We expect operating expenses of $9.1 billion to $9.2 billion, which includes 2 points of FX headwind. This includes $1.1 billion of LinkedIn expenses, of which $154 million is related to amortization.
Other income and expense should be approximately $450 million as we continued to take gains in our equities portfolio. And we expect this pace to continue until the end of the fiscal year.
Now, let me share some additional comments on fiscal 2018, given our strong first quarter results, our business momentum and the changing currency landscape. First on FX. For the full year at current rates, we expect FX to increase revenue, COGS and OpEx growth at the company level by 1 point. Therefore, we now expect full-year operating expense growth, excluding LinkedIn, to be between 4% and 5%. This is unchanged from our prior outlook except for the updated FX impact.
Second, on margins. With our strong Q1 results and the FX impacts I just outlined, we are trending a bit better on both gross and operating margin relative to our original full-year outlook of down roughly 1 point each. We now expect operating margin, ex-LinkedIn, to be up year over year, even as we increase investment to support long-term top-line growth in commercial cloud, AI, Mixed Reality, quantum, new hardware launches and the continued transformation of our sales team.
Third, tax rate. We're updating our full-year tax rate to 22%, plus or minus 2 points, with variability due to the mix of service and license revenue, geographic mix of revenue and timing of equity vest, and expect next quarter's tax rates to come in at the midpoint of that full-year range.
Chris, let's go to Q&A.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Amy. We'll now move to Q&A. Jesse, can you please repeat your instructions?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Absolutely. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question is coming from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question, and very nice quarter. Satya, a question for you. We've been seeing Intelligent Cloud growing very well for quite some time, Azure sustaining very, very impressive growth rates, but even the server and tools businesses sustaining growth. When we think about the drivers of that growth, is this just continued share gains by Microsoft, enabling you guys to outgrow the market? Or have you started to see stuff like AI and all these additional cognitive services that you bring to the market actually accelerating workload growth within your customers? You're actually like building new market opportunity for yourselves with these additional services.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Keith, for the question. And I would say all of the above. One of the things that we started always, we always believed in distributed computing, and we've built for that so when we say hybrid, we never thought of it as some kind of a temporary state but we always thought the edge and the cloud was going to be where the application pattern was in fact going to get to. In fact, I'm very excited about some of the new workloads.
If I look at whether it's IoT or AI, the two workloads that are new, both of them require both computation and intelligence on the edge and a very new way to do even computation, which event-driven computation. So we feel good about new workload growth. We feel good about this lift-shift modernize motions that are happening. We feel that we're well positioned for both meeting today's realities of our enterprise customers, but most importantly, where on a secular basis I believe hybrid computing is going, which is to this architectural pattern of intelligent cloud, intelligent edge.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Keith.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, we'll take the next question now, Jesse, please.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you very much. I had a question related to Azure. You guys mentioned on the call that premium services grew triple digits for the 13th quarter in a row. And I was wondering if you could give us a sense for how to think about the percentage of workloads that are now running premium services as a percentage of the total. And/or are we at the point now where that's a high enough percentage of the mix that we're at a tipping point here, where what seems like very significant gross margin progression is going to continue at this similar clip? Thank you.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
I mean, I can start and, Amy, you can add to this. The premium services, for example, the way we think about them is in everything related to our data is, and especially the higher level databases, so I'm not talking about raw storage but this is Cosmos DB or Azure DB or any of data services, our IoT services, our AI services are all the premium services. And there is a path. Every customer sometimes just starts with infrastructure as a service and some storage. And then the lift-shift turns into lift-shift and modernize and that's where these premium services get activated. So they definitely are margin accretive for us, but most importantly, they add a tremendous amount of value to the customers. And I'll let Amy add any additional color to that.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And I think, Heather, it gives me a good opportunity to talk a little bit about the real drivers of the Azure gross margin improvement. There are really, when you think about it, three. The first one's just pure revenue scale. We've done such a terrific job, I think, of growing and focusing and the innovation we put in and having our sales teams, through investments we've made for the past couple of years, and competency building, land that at customers.
The second component, and the one you'd asked about, is a little bit about that premium services revenue mix. And you're absolutely seeing the impact of that growth as mix show up in the gross margin. And addition to the workloads Satya mentioned, I'll also bring up EMF. EMF continues to be I think of incredible value to customers. And I think we've done a very good job of pointing out its competitive advantages, and we're seeing that also benefit margins.
And finally, just the strong work on the infrastructure team, both between hardware innovation done at everything from the network, all the way to the prox and their integration with each other as well as the software innovation being done on top of it. Those things together, with premium being a component of that, are all lending itself to gross margin improvement.

Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Philip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Thanks guys, and congrats on a great quarter. I just wanted to focus in on Office because you've obviously spent a fair amount of time on Azure, the gross margins there. But within Office, you've got several secular trends as well as just mix shift going on there just from a price point perspective as well as the gross margin between the different levels of E1, E3, E5. So wondering if you could give us some color of what we're seeing there, because obviously, there's healthy, healthy seat growth, revenues outpacing and it seems like margins are as well. So just provide us more color on sort of what we've been seeing and kind of how you think about that trending going forward?
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Let me just start at the highest of levels, because for us again, and in this last quarter, some of the innovation that we launched I think is also pretty key as you look forward to what it means for Office and Office growth. One of the new suites we have is called F1 and this is about first-line work. So Office is no longer limited just to the knowledge workers. In fact, we see significant opportunity for some of our teamwork, collaboration, communications, as well as scheduling software to be very, very relevant for anyone who's on the manufacturing plant or a retail specialist. Some of our social tools like Yammer are increasingly getting used for broad communications, inclusive of Skype for Teams.
So I just wanted to put that in there as well, as there is of course E3. There is E3 to E5. But there is also F1, which is increasing the overall penetration and not to mention the small business segment, and of course all the markets that we participate in with Office 365 where we don't have much of a server business at all. We sold Office on-premise or Office perpetual clients. But now you can have a small business in a country like India, buy Office 365 as a subscription service. So those are all the things that are in play.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And I do think that's important, Keith, in terms of the innovation and the value. I think sometimes, on this call in particular, we talk about there's installed base growth and there's ARPU increases. Sitting underneath that is this very large 120 million dollar-monthly active users in commercial. And they're experiencing frankly the latest innovations that the company has built. So I look and say, seeing growth in that number allows us to actually grow the ARPU, and the new services that Satya mentioned continues to let us grow the installed base.
Innovations around teams, innovations in AI in the actual Office products themselves are now being experienced by our customers. I think when you have that happen over time, it builds confidence in the product and it builds confidence in end-user confidence in itself. And then purchasers are happy to continue to add SKUs and add and move up the scale. We still, this is primarily the ARPU growth, continues to be some of the earlier transitions we've always talked about. It's that E3 transition as well as installed base growth. E5 continues to see encouraging signs. We're starting to see it enter but that will take a long time, as we've talked about, to actually land in ARPU.

Thank you. The next question is coming from line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thanks. This one for Amy. Amy, just a general sort of corporate-wide question on gross margins. Your revenue and COGS guide, if I ran the math correctly, imply about 60% gross margins for the December quarter. So that's going to be down year over year and I suspect below some of the street estimates. But it sounds like your tone is a little bit better for gross margins for the full year. So I just want to make sure I leave the call understanding what's happening here. Is the conclusion that 2Q is somewhat of a one-off, given the uptick in lower-margin hardware and thereafter will return to a more normal year over year pattern on gross margins? Thank you.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Karl. Actually, this is really all the gaming Xbox One console launch. It's very specific. And so every other gross margin trend across IC, across PBP and across the rest of the MPC portfolio exhibits the exact same fundamental drivers and improvement. And so really, this is really 100% the Xbox One X impact in Q2 of the launch on the company gross margin and in particular, the MPC gross margin.
Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Hi, thanks. I think another question for Amy here. Just looking at the dependent – trying to figure out the dependency of your Azure growth this year on the volume of annuity up for renewal. I know last year, you had very, very strong growth in annuity on that renewal cycle, and you're talking about some pressure in the Q2 and then a slightly up trend for the year. But how dependent is Azure growth in customers attaching that to the volume of annuity up?
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Yeah, I wouldn't call it pressure, Walter, just how I think about it. There's just an expiration base that comes up every quarter.
Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Understood.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And there's volatility to it. So the way to think about it is over the year, it's up a little and in Q2, it happens to be just a low quarter of the 12 that come up through the cycle, much like Q4 was quite large in the cycle. And Azure actually falls a couple of patterns. It's not just about EA attach although it absolutely can be one of the motions. Because it tends to be project-based as well and many of the investments we've made in sales capacity, and the reason we did some of the sales transformation, was to invest a lot more in that project-led motion, which is a bit disconnected actually from the EA renewal cycle, and you've really seen that. The Azure pace is not, if you drew a line, as correlated to EAs as it even was 3 years ago, as we've I think matured the product and matured our sales cycles.
Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Okay. Great, thank you.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.

Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
Kirk Materne - Evercore Group LLC
Thanks very much and I'll add my congrats on the quarter. Satya, yesterday you were down at the GE event and announcing the partnership with them around Predix. And I was wondering, when we think about the opportunities for Azure to be that sort of trusted platform for ISVs, can you just talk about how you think the progress is going on that front? Because it seems to obviously just expand your overall TAM and the kind of use cases you can address by bringing partners like GE onto your platform. Thanks.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Yeah. Thank you for the question. Overall, I think you sort of speak to I think one of the big advantages and one of the big value propositions we have on to both sides. One is to the enterprise customer. We are a trusted partner. And we support them with their hybrid computing needs and their AI needs. One of the things that we emphasize is it's not about our technology, but it's our ability to transfer that capability to our customer because they're increasingly becoming, whether you're in retail or you're in oil and gas or you're in financial services, every one of them is trying to build their own software capability and we are uniquely capable of doing so.
The second part is the ISVs. We now, in fact, one of the big areas of investment this year was the core sell capacity in our field so that ISVs can be successful on our platform. Whether it is GE or Adobe and many others can all now benefit, both because of our enterprise partnership and credibility, and more importantly because of the field resources we have put in place. So we are really looking forward to accelerating our business with GE and many others to come. But it's a very important core sell motion and more importantly building trust on both sides of that equation.

Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.
Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my question, and again congrats on the quarter. I'd like to look at Dynamics 365. It's been growing really fast. It was center stage at Envision in almost every presentation and discussion. Can you talk more about how you think about the opportunity and give us a sense of which of the offerings right now within 365, whether it's CRM or Talent or ERP or whatever, are driving the growth and could be part of the future growth? Thanks.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Thank you, Mark, for that question. The way we designed Dynamics 365, both on the technology front as well as on the business model front was to get away from what I would describe as the old-school suite-based selling or suite-based building of these things, whether it's CRM or ERP or SCM. Because we realized that, for example, you take any IoT project that is starting in Azure, it first translates into an analytics workload that pulls through some Azure high router analytics services. And then immediately after you do something like preventive maintenance, you need field service. And all they need is just a very robust field service module that's cost-effective and efficient. And so we're able to attach that to that project.
Similarly on Talent, they want to be able to – if you start on LinkedIn with hiring, you want to be able to do the on-boarding and talent management. That's the module you want. Even on the operations side, we are realizing that even if you keep your financials the same, there is need, and with increasing digitization, there is more operational modules that you need. So that's what we've designed it for. So the growth is actually across the board. It's coming in customer service. It's coming in sales. It's coming in talent. It's coming in operations, and we have some very competitive price points there.
The other one is that there is no such thing as a canonical business. There's no such thing as a canonical business in time. That means things are always changing. So customization, customization and composition, especially with Office 365, is very important, and this is where we have some very differentiated offer with Power BI, PowerApps and Flow. And that's another big driver of some of that growth across our enterprise customers.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.

Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Adam Holt with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question.
Adam Holt - MoffettNathanson LLC
Hi, everyone. That was some quarter. I'm tempted to ask about the strength in Windows, which I know you don't talk about much and don't get much questions about. But really since we've launched, the question that I get by far the most is around the long-term margin potential in Azure. And with the gross margins being as good as they were this quarter, without giving us long-term guidance, is there any reason to believe that the long-term operating margins in Azure couldn't be – we just saw AWS put up a mid-20s operating margin. Is there anything structural that would lead us to believe that you couldn't do something in that range? Or how should we think about the long-term framework for that business? Thank you.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
I'll start, Adam. The one thing I'd say is when I think about the long-term margin, I actually think of the long-term margin across our cloud. I mean, when we even make our CapEx decisions, which is one of the drivers of margin, we think of first of all, first party equals third party. A lot of what we do even in Windows, mostly people don't recognize it, but one of the most important services we run is Windows Update as a cloud service. And so we have a lot of value that is across the board cloud services, whether it's Xbox Live, Windows Update, Office 365, Dynamics 365, and of course all of the Azure services. And we're going to build scale across all of them.
And so we would not – in fact, we will be very aggressive in taking margin in one place, which is different as we see a path to margin in a different spot. That's something that we want to make sure we follow more our opportunity in a customer across the board versus trying to micromanage to certain margins in very specific opportunities, because we think that it's the integrated ability for us to deliver value is which I think long term is what the customers expect of Microsoft.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And I would just add that as we think about that long-term trajectory, our ability to continue to improve margins in our SaaS portfolio and our PaaS portfolio and IaaS portfolio still exists. And our ability to blend them into interesting products that solve customer solutions, which may not even be priced as the component parts, is I think how we think about, especially in our solution areas that Satya talks about, how we talk about delivering it to a customer. So while I'm confident in our ability to continue to grow the core margin, I do think for us in particular, it really is a portfolio that we believe that we need to manage appropriately.
Adam Holt - MoffettNathanson LLC

Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.

Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Michael Nemeroff with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Nemeroff - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Hi. And thanks for taking my question. My question is on the Gaming business. Given the even larger focus you're putting on this segment in the near-term, how quickly or in what timeframe do you think Gaming revenue could grow at or above the average gaming industry growth rate of mid to high-single digits? And I know you don't break out segment margins, but could you give us a sense of how you think about Gaming from a normalized contribution margin perspective relative to MPC and your overall company-wide margins, excluding the one-time Xbox launch effects? Thanks.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
I can start again. I would say from a Gaming perspective, one of the bigger changes that has happened in the last, I would say, couple of years is one, of course the vibrancy of the Xbox Live network across the PC and the console and now increasingly even on the phone because of titles like Minecraft. And once you have the network, you have plenty of different opportunities. In particular, we now have a subscription offer with Game Pass that's off to a good very good start and our goal is to be able to have essentially a Netflix for games, so that we can have the game subscriptions that people can use across all of the devices that they play in.
The other area is streaming. As you know, there is game playing and game watching and there is secular growth on both fronts. And we feel very, very good about the engagement increases in a pretty unique value proposition we have in Mixer. So that's another opportunity that we believe will shape in addition to things like e-sports and so on.
So it's the totality of that. And one of the numbers that I did put in my script was that 20% growth in what we call software and services, that's perhaps a leading indicator of where we think the opportunity lies. These are early days for us, but that said, that's probably one of the key numbers to watch as we make progress and execute.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And because of that, you're actually already seeing that impact in the MPC gross margins. Even this quarter is a great example. There was material improvement in gross margin in that segment, and a lot of that was actually due to the higher margins that we have structurally in that software and services revenue from Xbox. And as I believe, the industry that Satya is talking about pivots to be more about the engagement and monetization of that member network, you can expect that margin profile as well of our traditional, more hardware-focused Xbox to evolve, to be a real combination of those two things going forward. And structurally, that would of course have higher operating margin.

Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hey, thanks for taking my question. The conversation we have on around Azure and adoption there seems to be changing with customers, where they seem to be seeking a deeper relationship with you guys now, given that your maturity has increased quite a bit over the last few quarters. Can you talk to that? Is that something that just I picked up, or is that what you're seeing in your conversations as well? Thank you.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Hopefully, we picked it up a lot earlier than you did. But we have. So we do have a very different dialogue. You think about it, all of the customers that we have worked with, we have always worked with them historically even in our server days. But to your point, Raimo, I think what has happened is the change, even in the financial services, the segments that you all represent, the kinds of workloads now that are moving to the cloud has qualitatively changed.
In the past we participated, but a lot of Tier 1 workloads were not on Microsoft stack, whereas now, a lot of Tier 1 workloads are in fact increasingly on Microsoft cloud. And so to me, that represents a qualitative change, and so the type of dialogue we have, whether it's with an auto company or a financial services company or a retail company, is much deeper, much broader. And I would use the word we are deeply partnering with them. It's no longer just simple vendor relationships, because as they are trying to build their own software capability, they need a trusted partner who's more interested in making sure that they build their own technology capability. And that's what we're investing in.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And I would say, Raimo, a way to think about this is we've always had that trusted relationship, which we're incredibly proud of as a company with our enterprise customers. The investments we've made over the past years are about hiring the type of talent that can go and sit with a customer and drive the customer's successful outcomes of the projects they deploy. And that's what we mean. It's about the investment we've made in capability, the evolution of the product and its innovation. And I think using and trying to continue to earn the customer trust to deliver these world-class workloads. So I do think this is really an output of multiple years of concentration on delivering that capability.
Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Perfect. Thank you.

Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks for taking my question. Satya, I was curious. You've made a number of announcements with Adobe over the last year or so. And it seems like Microsoft's product and Adobe's products are getting more intertwined. And just curious from your perspective, if you could just maybe give us some insights into where you see the big opportunities to work with a vendor like Adobe and what are the go to market actions that you're seeing being more successful? Thank you.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Yes, we're very excited about the partnership with Adobe. And as you said, Adobe and Microsoft have partnered. In fact, across our entire histories in many of the areas, but increasingly across of the creative cloud and their Document Cloud as well as their Experience Cloud, we have plenty going on.
In fact, we are very excited about what we are doing with our devices and Adobe and with Windows because I think Windows and Windows 10 Creators Update is the ideal platform for all of the creators in the world because of the innovation in Windows and the innovation in devices, both Surface Book as well as our OEM devices. So that's one area that I think you will see. I would love if you're an illustrator or a Photoshop user, you should just check out the dial support that they have in Surface, which just is beautiful.
And then you go to Office 365. We have a partnership with them on e-signatures. We have good interoperability between our respective document clouds. That will in fact continue. And then on the creative side or on the experience side, in fact we are adding a lot of data and AI capability, which is obviously key to Adobe as an ISV.
So we're looking forward to the, ultimately the impact all this has with customers in terms of their ability to take advantage of our respective value and for them to be able to benefit from it all. And so these kinds of partnerships, whether it's with Adobe or others, we are very focused on making sure that ISVs and partners have success on our platforms. And that's sort of our core heritage, and that's something that we want to absolutely focus on.

Chris Suh
Thanks, Reyna. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me today are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary.
On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and the financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provides a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.
Unless otherwise specified, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's fourth quarter performance in addition to the impact these items and events had on the financial results.
All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. We also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations.
At the start of fiscal 2018, Microsoft adopted ASC 606, the revenue accounting standard.

In early August, we will be holding a conference call to provide you with information that will aid you in the transition to the new standard.
We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included on our live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website until July 20, 2018.
During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.
Satya Nadella
Thank you, Chris, and thank you to everyone joining on the phone. This quarter, we delivered $24.7 billion in revenue, up 10% in constant currency. For the year, we’re at $96.7 billion in revenue, up 5%. I’m proud of the progress, particularly the strength of our commercial cloud results. FY 2017 all up was a tremendous year of customer momentum with cloud, AI, and digital transformation.
Our technology world view of an Intelligent Cloud and an Intelligent Edge is resonating with businesses everywhere. Every customer I talk to is looking for both innovative technology to drive new growth, as well as a strategic partner who can help build their own digital capability. Microsoft is that trusted partner.
Now let’s look at the progress we have made this quarter by segment, starting with Productivity and Business Process. The workplace is transforming from changing employee expectations, a need for more diverse skills and globally distributed teams, and an increasingly complex threat environment. Only Microsoft gives customers a comprehensive approach for this new culture of work.
Earlier this month, we introduced Microsoft 365, which brings together Office 365, Windows 10, and Enterprise Mobility & Security in a complete, secure solution to empower employees, safeguard businesses, and simplify IT management. Microsoft 365 is a fundamental shift in how we design, build, and go-to-market to address customer needs.
Fortune 500 customers Fed-Ex, Dow Chemical, Staples, Progressive Insurance all chose Microsoft 365. The success of our Secure Productive Enterprise offering with its triple digit seat growth is one reason we are investing in Microsoft 365 for businesses of all sizes. We continue to see strong growth of Office 365 with customers like Nissan, Quicken Loans, Key Bank, Deutsche Telekom all choosing Office 365.
And importantly, customers are moving beyond core workloads to adopt higher value workloads. For example, we’ve seen a significant increase in SharePoint usage, which nearly doubled year-over-year. The classroom is also transforming. This quarter, we introduced Microsoft Teams in Office 365 for Education, the digital hub for students and teachers. 
Microsoft Teams gives educators a whole new way to create and inspire modern classroom environments. With rich learning tools and the ability to have digital conversations with students, share materials and manage assignments, Teams gives educators more time to focus on doing what they love most, teaching.
Now I’ll talk about the second part of our ambition in this segment, reinventing business process. We are investing in the LinkedIn flagship experience to create new value for members and customers and accelerate growth. We saw continued momentum in mobile and strong engagement across the platform, with sessions up more than 20% for the third consecutive quarter. And we continue to innovate new ways for members to maximize the value of the platform.
We launched a new messaging overlay resulting in record levels of messages sent on LinkedIn, and introduced a career advice marketplace that will let members easily tap into the professional expertise of more than 500 million members around the world. On top of that, Talent Solutions saw record level growth in confirmed hires and InMail response rates this quarter.
I’ve talked about the opportunities with Dynamics and LinkedIn. Earlier this month, we launched Microsoft Relationship Sales solution, bringing together LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Microsoft Dynamics, as well as Dynamics 365 solutions for Retail and Talent. In a world where customers are increasingly digitizing every business process, we continue to invest and expand our portfolio of modern, modular business applications that are infused with AI.
We also introduced ISV Cloud Embed to make it easier for partners to modernize their existing business process applications, build new ones using Dynamics 365, Power BI, Power Apps, and Microsoft Flow. A global healthcare solution provider and partner Indegene is using it to create a mobile CRM solution for medical sales. Customers like HSBC, Best Buy, and Dolce & Gabbana all chose Dynamics 365 to transform their own businesses processes and experience the benefits of moving away from monolithic suites.
Now, let’s talk about the progress we are making in our Intelligent Cloud segment. Our commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate now exceeds $18.9 billion. This quarter’s cloud growth puts us squarely on track to reach the goal we set a little over two years ago of $20 billion in commercial cloud ARR in fiscal 2018. More than ever before, customers are placing their trust in the Microsoft cloud.
Azure revenue accelerated this quarter, growing 97% year-over-year. CIOs and Business Decision Makers increasingly prefer Azure as they make decisions about their cloud strategy. They value our hybrid consistency, developer productivity, AI capabilities, and trusted approach. And we keep investing in cloud computing to create broader economic benefit and opportunity, as we’ve done with our South Africa datacenter expansion, bringing Azure to 40 regions globally - more than any other cloud provider. And as part of our commitment to trust, we are helping our customers prepare to be GDPR compliant and meet the requirements of the European Union ahead of the enforcement deadline.
AXA Global, KPMG, Dun & Bradstreet, Hearst, Walgreens, T-Mobile and Sephora all chose Azure to transform their businesses. Box announced that it will bring its content and collaboration services to Azure and plans to use our AI to simplify discovery and use of all types of content across the enterprise. And Baidu will use Azure to take its autonomous driving platform worldwide.
The core currency of any business going forward will be the ability to convert their data into AI that drives competitive advantage. It all starts with having support for the comprehensive data estate spanning Azure Database, Cosmos DB, Data Warehouse, Data Lake, combined with SQL Server. Azure Cosmos DB is the industry’s first globally distributed database service. It enables customers to securely and reliably power data-intensive applications at unprecedented scale and performance from IoT to AI to mobile and much more.
Retailer Jet.com is using Azure Cosmos DB to process trillions of transactions every day. Customers are infusing AI into their products & services using Azure AI infrastructure and services such as Bot Framework and Cognitive Services. Sabre, a leading technology provider to the global travel industry, is piloting AI-powered solutions for travel agencies to better serve customers. And Dixons Carphone is using Azure and our Cognitive Services to boost customer engagement and provide a more consistent, seamless experience across online and in their stores.
Azure is also unique in its support for this emerging intelligent cloud and intelligent edge applications. Azure IoT Edge extends cloud intelligence to edge devices. This means IoT devices can act locally at the edge, while taking advantage of the cloud for global coordination and machine learning at scale. Azure is the first cloud to provide true hybrid support that customers predominately choose. Azure Stack extends Azure to enable developers to build and deploy applications the same way whether they run on the intelligent cloud or at the intelligent edge, so customers can meet any regulatory requirement and bring cloud applications to remote or disconnected locations like cruise ships or oil rigs.
Now I’ll turn to our progress in More Personal Computing. Against the backdrop of more than 500 million Windows 10 monthly active devices and continued broad progress across the Windows ecosystem, I want to highlight a couple of key strategic areas this quarter. Windows 10 is made to inspire the creator in all of us and is pivotal to enabling employees to transform the way they work. Increasingly, commercial customers value Windows 10 as the foundation for a secure, modern workplace. Enterprise and education deployments increased 33% over the last quarter, as companies like NASCAR, Emirates Airline, BMW Group, Bank of China all adopt Windows 10.
This quarter, we introduced Windows 10 S, streamlined for simplicity, security and superior performance and tailored for the classroom. Our goal for Windows 10 S is to develop a vibrant ecosystem with partners like Acer, ASUS, Dell, Fujitsu, HP, Samsung, and Toshiba to introduce a new class of modern devices that enables affordable, powerful new scenarios from Windows ink to 3D. We also introduced Surface Laptop and the new Surface Pro this quarter to continue to build and create momentum for new Windows device categories.
Now on to gaming. Our gaming business is now more than $9 billion, and growing profitably. The gaming world is evolving faster than ever before - from game play across multiple devices, to the explosive growth in streaming and eSports, to new subscription services and mixed reality scenarios. We are uniquely positioned to capture a large share of this opportunity because of our ability to unite the global community of gamers through Xbox Live, now 53 million strong and growing, and to enable new experiences across PC, console and mobile. Our approach is to let gamers play the games they want, with the people they want, on the devices they want.
At E3, we celebrated the passion of gamers by introducing Xbox One X, broadening our portfolio of gaming devices with the world’s most powerful console. We launched two new services that broaden our reach and enrich the gaming experience, both of which are off to a very strong start. Mixer, our new live streaming service, makes it easier than ever before for gamers to create and share across platforms and to interact in entirely new ways. The Xbox Game Pass is a digital subscription service that expands our existing gaming value proposition.
In closing, I’m proud of the progress this year, both in our own continued transformation and in how we are empowering customers to digitally transform. As technology disrupts every industry and has the power to make a difference in the lives of everyone, we strive to create local opportunity and growth and impact in every country around the world. Our platforms and tools help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness and public sector efficiency.
They also support new startups, improve educational and health outcomes and empower human ingenuity. Our sense of purpose lies in our customers’ success. Transformation is a continuous process of renewal and reinvestment. We will continue to invest in the high growth opportunities, lead innovation in cloud and AI, and bring our technology and products together into experiences and solutions that unlock new value for customers.
Now, I’ll hand it over to Amy to walk through this quarter’s results in more detail and share our outlook. And I look forward to rejoining for your questions.
Amy Hood 
Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $24.7 billion, up 9% and 10% in constant currency, with stronger than expected performance across all segments. Gross margin grew 11% and 12% in constant currency. Operating income increased 13% and 16% in constant currency. And earnings per share was $0.98, increasing 42% and 43% in constant currency, which includes $0.23 from the utilization of phone-related losses from prior years that were previously non-deductible.
At a company level, LinkedIn contributed approximately 5 points of revenue and gross margin growth. LinkedIn’s operating loss of $361 million was a 6 point drag on total company operating income growth, and is entirely attributable to the $371 million of amortization of acquired intangibles recorded in COGS and OpEx.
From a geographic perspective, our results were mostly in line with macroeconomic trends, though large markets like the US, Germany, and Japan performed better than we expected. We had a strong quarter in our commercial business, reflecting terrific execution from our sales teams and partners in the largest quarter of our year. We increased commitment to our commercial cloud and healthy renewals on a record volume of expirations.
We closed the highest number of multi-million-dollar Azure deals to date, and improved our annuity mix to 86%, up 3 points year-over-year. As a result, commercial bookings grew 30%, and commercial unearned revenue was $27.8 billion, significantly higher than we expected. Our contracted not billed balance increased to more than $31.5 billion.
As Satya mentioned earlier, our commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate exceeded $18.9 billion this quarter, growing 56%. We finished the year with nearly $15 billion in commercial cloud revenue. 
At the start of the year, we committed to material improvement in commercial cloud gross margin percentage and dollars. This quarter, our commercial cloud gross margin percentage was 52%, up 10 points year-over-year, with positive gross margin in each cloud service. Commercial cloud gross margin dollars grew 92% from strength across all services.
Our company gross margin was 66%, up 1 point from the prior year, as sales mix of higher margin products and services offset the impact of the growing mix of cloud revenue and $217 million of LinkedIn amortization costs. FX was mostly in line with our expectations, with 1 point of negative impact on total revenue growth even with a slightly weaker than expected US dollar.
At the segment level, FX had a negative impact of 2 points on Productivity and Business Processes, 1 point on Intelligent Cloud and 1 point on More Personal Computing. Total operating expenses grew 9% and 10% in constant currency, with LinkedIn contributing 12 points of growth, including $154 million of amortization of acquired intangibles expense.
Now, to our segment results. Revenue from our Productivity and Business Processes segment grew 21% and 23% in constant currency to $8.4 billion, with LinkedIn contributing 15 points of growth. Office Commercial revenue increased 5% and 6% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue grew 43% and 44% in constant currency with continued installed base growth across all workloads, ARPU expansion and emerging E5 momentum. For the first time, Office 365 Commercial revenue surpassed revenue from our traditional licensing business.
Office Consumer revenue increased 13%, driven by recurring subscription revenue and growth in our subscriber base. Our Dynamics business grew 7% and 9% in constant currency, and Dynamics 365 grew 74% and 75% in constant currency. LinkedIn revenue for the quarter was approximately$1.1 billion, a bit better than expected.
Segment gross margin dollars grew 14% and 16% in constant currency, with 12 points of contribution from LinkedIn, including $217 million of amortization. Gross margin percentage declined from an increasing cloud revenue mix and the impact of LinkedIn related amortization.
Operating expenses increased 41%, with 40 points from LinkedIn, including $154 million of amortization expense. Operating income declined 8% and 5% in constant currency, with 12 points of impact from LinkedIn. The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered $7.4 billion in revenue, growing 11% and 12% in constant currency.
Our server products and cloud services revenue grew 15% and 16% in constant currency with double digit annuity revenue growth. Azure revenue growth accelerated to 97%, up 98% in constant currency. Azure Premium revenue grew triple-digits for the twelfth consecutive quarter. Enterprise Services revenue declined 3% and 1% in constant currency, driven by a lower volume of Windows Server 2003 custom support agreements, partially offset by growth in Premier Support Services.
Segment gross margin dollars grew 8% and 9% in constant currency, and segment gross margin percentage declined due to increasing cloud revenue mix and lower Enterprise Services margins, partially offset by material improvement in Azure margins. We grew operating expenses by 2% and 3% in constant currency with continued investment in sales capacity and developer engagement. Operating income increased 15%, up 18% in constant currency.
Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue from this segment was $8.8 billion, down 2% and 1% in constant currency, with 4 points of decline from phone. Our OEM business grew 1% this quarter, as both our commercial and consumer OEM businesses were slightly ahead of the PC market. OEM Pro revenue grew 3%, ahead of the commercial PC market, mainly due to a higher mix of premium SKUs. Windows 10 deployment cycles continue to drive commercial customer hardware demand.
OEM Non-Pro revenue was flat, ahead of the consumer PC market, with continued positive impact from Windows premium device mix. Inventories remain in the normal range. Windows commercial cloud products and services grew 8%, driven by annuity revenue growth. Enterprise customers increasingly chose Windows 10 on new and existing devices, which led to install base growth and higher adoption of our cloud security solutions.
Patent licensing declined this quarter, primarily from lower revenue per unit. Search revenue ex-TAC grew 10% and 11% in constant currency, driven by higher revenue per search and search volume. Devices revenue declined 28% and 27% in constant currency. Our Surface business performed better than we expected, declining 2% and 1% in constant currency, with strong sales execution on our Surface Pro product transition and early positive signals from customers and partners on our Surface Laptop launch in June.
Our gaming business grew 3% and 4% in constant currency. Xbox software and services growth of 11%, 13% in constant currency, offset declines in hardware. And our engaged user base grew 8% to 53 million monthly active users across console, mobile and Windows 10 platforms. Segment gross margin dollars increased 9% and 10% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage increased, primarily due to sales mix shift to higher margin products and services.
Operating expenses declined 10%, and 9% in constant currency, from lower Phone expense, as well as Surface and gaming marketing spend in the prior year. As a result, operating income grew 68% and 72% in constant currency. Now back to the overall company results. This quarter, we invested approximately $3.3 billion in capital expenditures, including capital leases, up sequentially in part due to the planned Q3 datacenter spend pushed into this Q4. This includes approximately $2.3 billion of cash paid for property and equipment, which was down year-over-year as we utilized more capital leases.
Free cash flow grew 50% year-over-year, driven primarily by operating cash flow growth of 30%, as well as lower cash outlays for CapEx. Operating cash flow increased due to higher collections from customers following strong billings growth, as well as working capital improvements in our hardware business. Other income and expense was $215 million, more than originally planned, as we continue to see opportunities in the equities market to realize gains throughout the quarter.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was negative 6%, significantly lower than we expected, due to a $1.8 billion impact related to the utilization of prior years’ losses from our phone business that were not deductible in the years incurred. Excluding this item, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 19% this quarter and 20% for the full year. This quarter, we returned $4.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
Now let’s turn to the outlook. The key trends for FY 2018 from the Financial Analyst Briefing remain largely unchanged. For the full year, we expect about 1 point of negative FX impact assuming current rates remain stable. In our commercial business, we anticipate that increasing demand for cloud services and healthy renewals will continue to drive a higher annuity mix. Our commercial transactional business will continue to decline driven by the transition to the cloud.
We remain focused on improving our commercial cloud gross margin percentage in each of our cloud services. As a reminder, given seasonality and revenue mix, commercial cloud gross margin will experience quarterly variability. Cloud migrations, deployments and new scenarios are driving greater customer usage. We will increase our capital investment to meet growing demand and capacity needs. Total CapEx spend will continue to have variability quarter-to-quarter.
At the company level, our gross margin percentage should decline about a point in FY 2018 with increasing cloud revenue mix, a full year of LinkedIn amortization and hardware launches, including our new console, Xbox One X. We expect LinkedIn quarterly amortization expense in COGS to be approximately $220 million, or about $880 million for the full year.
Next, operating expenses. You should think about our FY 2018 operating expenses in two categories. First, organic Microsoft expenses, which we expect to grow between 3% and 4%, reflecting the investments we are making to support our top line growth. Second, LinkedIn. We are making incremental investments in LinkedIn to fuel its continued strong revenue growth. Additionally, we will recognize our first full year of operating expenses, including $620 million of amortization expense.
Importantly, we expect our company operating margin to only decline by about a point as we continue to grow our cloud revenue, we fund new investment to support growth in strategic areas and absorb $1.5 billion of LinkedIn amortization in COGS and OpEx. Excluding the LinkedIn impact, operating margin should be flat year-over-year.
Next, our effective tax rate. As a reminder, our tax rate is impacted by at least three major factors: the proportion of services revenue versus licensing revenue, the geographic mix of revenue, and the timing of equity vests. As cloud revenue mix increases, we anticipate our tax rate will move higher. With quarterly variability based on these factors, we anticipate our full year non-GAAP tax rate to be 23%, plus or minus 2 points. And finally, we expect LinkedIn, ex-purchase accounting, to be non-dilutive in FY 2018, as it was in Q4.
Now, to the outlook for next quarter. Based on current FX rates, we expect less than 1 point of negative impact on revenue growth overall and for each segment. We expect commercial unearned revenue to be within the range of $24.85 to $25.05 billion. 
In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $8.1 and $8.3 billion. Office 365 commercial revenue growth will continue to be driven by install base growth, ARPU expansion, and adoption of premium services like E5, and should outpace the rate of transactional decline.
We expect a more moderate rate of growth in our Office consumer business given prior year comparables. In our Dynamics business, Dynamics 365 will continue to drive our cloud mix higher. And we expect approximately $1.1 billion of revenue from LinkedIn, adjusted for the impact of purchase accounting.
For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $6.9 billion and $7.1 billion. Customer demand for Azure and our hybrid cloud offerings remains strong, and we anticipate another quarter of double-digit revenue growth across server products and cloud services. Enterprise Services should decline, given lower volumes of custom support agreements.
We expect More Personal Computing revenue between $8.6 billion and $8.9 billion. We anticipate OEM revenue will move more closely in line with the PC market. Devices revenue growth will continue to be impacted by the prior year phone comparable. Surface revenue will continue to be driven by the product lifecycle transition between Pro 4 and our new Surface Laptop and Surface Pro.
In Search, Bing’s revenue growth ex-TAC should be similar to prior quarters. And we expect gaming to have the typical seasonality revenue pattern for a pre-holiday quarter. We expect COGS between $8.2 billion and $8.3 billion, including approximately $400 million from LinkedIn. LinkedIn COGS include about $220 million of amortization.
We expect CapEx, on an accrual dollar basis, to be similar to Q4 as we grow our investment to meet demand. We expect operating expenses of $8.6 billion to $8.7 billion, with about $1 billion from LinkedIn, of which roughly $155 million is related to amortization. Other income and expense should be about $250 million, as we expect to realize more gains from our equities portfolio.
Given the volume of equity vests that occur in our first quarter and based on today’s stock value, we expect our first quarter non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 4 points lower than the estimated full year tax rate.
Finally, we adopted the new revenue standard, ASU 606, effective at the start of fiscal year 2018. To assist in the transition, Chris along with our Chief Accounting Officer, Frank Brod, will be hosting a conference call in early August to discuss these changes, present historical restated financial results, and share Q1 guidance converted to the new standard.
And with that let’s go to Q&A.
Chris Suh
Thanks Amy. We will not move to the Q&A. Reyna, can you please repeat your instructions?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Certainly. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Heather Bellini
Great, thank you very much for taking the question. Amy I had a question about commercial cloud COGS, and I was wondering if you could give us a sense of what percentage of these roughly is related to depreciation and how should we think about the pace of your CapEx deployments versus what you have been experiencing in commercial cloud to support the initiatives in the vast growth opportunities that you see ahead as we look out over the next 12 months to 24 months if there is anything you could share with us around that. Thank you.
Amy Hood
Let me break down the question in a couple of ways. Overall, when you think about COGS and the pacing, the depreciation rates of our servers don't change. It’s generally over a three-year period and there is other pieces of equipment that have a longer, shorter depreciation life. So that piece of depreciation doesn't change per se. If you're looking to see how we see demand, obviously this quarter in Q4, we felt very good about cloud demand across all three services, but in particular with Azure. 
I feel confident in our ability to produce gross margin improvement across all those services. I feel confident in our ability to continue to make progress on our overall commercial cloud gross margin growth, and I am encouraged by the demand signals we are getting. All of those things I think, it’s not really about the pace, it is much about the progress and demand and meeting those things as closely as we can and I feel really good about the team's execution.
Heather Bellini
Great, thank you.
Chris Suh
We will move to the next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Keith Weiss
Excellent, thank you guys for taking the question and very nice quarter. There’s lot of rumors and speculation around sales reorganization of you guys sort of shifting around resources is sort of better distributed to cloud and new technologies, I was wondering if you guys could dig into that for us a little bit, what kind of changes are taking place in terms of go to market distribution heading into FY 2018?
Satya Nadella
Let me start, first of all thank you for the question Keith. Overall, the approach we have taken for multiple years now is to transform everything that we do inside the company, whether it’s the product creation, how we’re organized in the R&D, how we think about breaking down any silos and category definitions we may have had in the past, how we think about even marketing and the marketing approach, and then of course even with the go to market, and this transformation is ongoing.
This has been happening over multiple years, but we have now got very good customer momentum because ultimately this is all driven by the opportunity at hand, which is much bigger than anything that we have participated in the past, so the total addressable market is much bigger. And second, our customer expectations and our partner expectations of how we show up with them has changed, and so over the years we have been making changes and now that we have a lot more momentum and critical mass, we are going to that next phase and that’s what you are seeing us in terms of changing the skill set, changing the scope of how we show up to support the digital transformation needs of both large customers, as well as small businesses.
Amy Hood
And I think in many ways Keith what we have done is a really a natural extension of some of the investments we’ve made over the past 18 months to add technical resources to be more present in customer accounts, to really drive their transformation towards success outcomes. You are seeing it even in our intelligent cloud results for the last quarter and this quarter. We’re taking that learning over the past 18 months and really applying it at a broader scale across the sales force to put those resources where we feel confident that they will have a good long-term return in that next phase of transformation.
Chris Suh
Thank you, Keith. We will take the next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Karl Keirstead
Thank you. Question for Amy, Amy there were a lot of numbers in this print that look very strong, but one that stood out to me was the commercial bookings growth of 30%, you did touch on it a little bit in your remarks, but if you don't mind I’d love to ask you a few questions, one is you mentioned that may be part of the strength was terrific execution on renewals, does it feel like maybe last quarter was a little bit of a renewal flush and in other words it might have been a one-time phenomenon? Secondly, is Microsoft doing anything different around contract, structure, or invoicing to that would result in bookings being unusually high, maybe collecting a little bit more upfront? And lastly, is it fair to interpret the strong bookings performance as giving us and I suppose you comfort in your revenue growth profile in fiscal 2018 as all those bookings obviously convert to reported revs? Thank you.
Amy Hood
Thanks Karl. Let me make sure I cover of on most of those. Let me start by saying, the biggest driver in commercial bookings growth this quarter was excellent execution on a large base of renewals. The second component of that is the execution on new revenue; in particular Azure, as well as Windows commercial, and billings in the quarter were very good and quite encouraging overall. There was no change in any way to invoicing people paying earlier, paying more upfront, that’s definitely not an impact on that number.
And so overall, I think while it is certainly aided by the large expiry base because it tends to impact the CNB balance the most, it is really I think to your point; it is clearly encouraging because it gives us a very good base of support going into FY 2018 to come in to the GAAP reporting numbers.
Karl Keirstead
Got it. Thank you, Amy.
Amy Hood
Thanks Karl.
Chris Suh
Thanks Karl. Next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed.
Walter Pritchard
Hi, thank you. Amy I’m wondering on the gross profit growth, I was looking through the slide deck, and looks like gross profit growth in PBT was up about 2%, you saw some strong trends in different parts of that business and I think that 2% I would have thought would have been higher, could you help us understand the puts and takes around gross profit growth in PBT?
Amy Hood
There’s a couple of things, but in general it is almost always mix shift. While we saw improvement in the gross margin percentage in Office 365 and continue to make progress on that it is also the balance, right. This is the first quarter where we’ve actually seen the balance tip in terms of recognized revenue to online versus perpetual. So, I actually feel very good, but as we continue to accelerate the growth trajectory that you are not seeing frankly much impact on the gross margin line and we are seeing a lot of leverage in that through OpEx all the way down to the operating income line.
Chris Suh
Okay. Thank you, Walter. We will take the next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.
Mark Moerdler
Thank you, and congrats on the quarter. Amy commercial cloud ARR grew 24% Q-over-Q, which is the largest Q-over-Q growth so far. Completely understand that Q4 is a big quarter for closing business, but 3.7 billion is a large number, can you give us some more color on exactly what is driving this growth and then I have a quick follow-up.
Amy Hood
Sure. When you think about, you are right, it is a big number, and I feel very good about it, and for the year on a pure basis it was $15 billion of commercial cloud revenue. So we are starting to get to that point Mark where you have a big base, which is still growing at a fast rate, and so especially ARR numbers can see big jumps in the one that you saw this quarter, and your right, Q4 is also historically quite a big quarter and this one certainly was as well. But you also saw - and what really does matter, especially in Azure is usage of growth, really consumption growth having customers use deploy, be successful, and really continue to get you think sort of meters up and running and that continues to build on itself, and so when you start to see that you can, and I do think and we will continue to see good growth in this number.
Mark Moerdler
Excellent. As a quick follow-up, how should we think of how that sets us up to 2018 in terms of hitting expectations, beating expectations, continuing, you know strong 40%, 50% year-over-year growth.
Amy Hood
Let me start by saying, first I feel very good about meeting our stated goal of $20 billion in commercial cloud ARR. Next, I think across every service the momentum we’ve seen in Q4 and in particular, I would say, I think not many people focus on it, but even things like Windows E5, advanced threat protection services, those types of deployments really will add to momentum in our offerings. One of the things we often talk about is, we sell Microsoft 365. That’s Windows 10 with securities and services. It is a modern workplace that includes up-to-date Office 365 and it includes EMS. We really did see strength across all of them. So I don't really think it’s about a percentage, but it’s about each of them continuing to make progress.
Mark Moerdler
Excellent and congrats.
Amy Hood
Thank you.
Chris Suh
Thanks Mark. We will take the next question please.

Our next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
Philip Winslow
Hi thanks guys and congrats on another great quarter. Question first for Amy on Office 365, Office 365 commercial revenue continues to outpace the unit growth monthly active users, so are you still seeing that trend up to E35 cetera, I wonder if you could take us through where we are in that life cycle and also just to follow on your comments to the last question, you know Satya you launched at Inspire your Microsoft 365 that Amy just mentioned, how should we think about Microsoft 365 in the context of Office 365, also just given the fact that Windows commercial actually accelerated this quarter as well.
Satya Nadella
Yeah, maybe I can start and then…
Amy Hood
Why don't you start and I will do the next one.
Satya Nadella
So one of the things that we are very excited about and have learnt a lot from is the secure productive enterprise offer that we have had now last year and impacted Q4, it really accelerated significantly, and so that has helped us in fact come up with Microsoft 365 at this very strong offering that brings together Office 365, Windows 10, as well as our enterprise mobility and security. And support even cross-platform devices. 
So we think of the modern workplace as having a very significant footprint of Windows, but also people will use phones of iOS and Android, but they need both productivity, creativity, and security across all of this estate of theirs, and that’s where I think we have a competitive advantage and a great value proposition. So that’s what Microsoft 365 embodies. 
It’s today available for enterprises and in the fall you will have the midmarket version of it, which I think is a another very big opportunity because it really helps take what we have learnt in the large enterprises and scale it to where perhaps the need is even more acute and so we are excited about that and at Inspire the partner channel obviously is very excited about it as well.
Amy Hood
And so to your point and it’s a nice transition from Satya's point about, especially the midmarket offering coming in the fall for Microsoft 365 is installed base growth. You are right, in terms of Office commercial 365 the primary driver is still installed base, both the transition as well as new. I think we are optimistic as we head into FY 2018 for the installed base growth possible in particular for some of these midmarket offerings that we’re quite proud off
The ARPU growth that you saw and have seen in the past couple of quarters continues to primarily, Phil, be related still to the E1 to E3 transition. When we mentioned E5, I think that’s frankly encouraging for us because all of these premium offers do best when you start the deployment motion. People start using E1 then they use E3 and then you start to see the momentum in E5, and we did see that. However, in terms of ARPU impact very, very small in quarter. So that’s something that over time you will continue to see improvement in terms of impact on ARPU.
Philip Winslow
Awesome guys thanks a lot.
Amy Hood
Thanks.
Chris Suh
Thank you. We will take the next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
Kash Rangan
Hi, thank you very much. I'm curious if you can shed a little bit more light on commercial bookings growth of 30%, clearly that’s off the chart and also when I look at the $18.9 billion of annualized revenue and judging from the fact that the commercial business non-Azure component of it was about steadying growth rate up [indiscernible] Azure went through some significant acceleration, which is yet to be reflected in your forward-looking revenues. If you could just shed a little bit more light and drill into any two or three products SKUs or areas or geographies that contributed to that on the chart performance that will be great? That's it from me, thank you very much and congrats.
Amy Hood
Thanks Kash. Let me go through the bookings, again with that 30% the first and best contributor to that is the strong performance on the renewals in quarter. It was a reasonably consistent Kash, there was not a geo in particular that I would say was a massive outlier although in two of our largest geos, the U.S. and Germany they did have very good years in particular in Q4. 
Now if you separate the fact that we had the larger base with clearly contribute to that bookings number being big, aside from that in particular Azure in the last year point did really show up in that 18.9, it didn't, the strong billings growth really showed up in that unearned outperformance, which you saw versus the guide and it was significant, a lot of that is the Azure fillings. I think we felt very good, those as well, I think we’re pretty broad-based across industry. I would also say across geo. 
And so while we of course get some strength from our largest geos, and I would say they were probably the largest contributors if it was actually quite broad there is not only one place for me to say that we just saw it here, and then the final component that I would say was better than we anticipated and the way you’d see that cash, again versus the unearned guidance and the beat that we had there with that final piece around our security value prop, ATP - Windows annuity growth was very good. That’s in the KPI Windows commercial products and services. It is the place you will look and see that number and outside of that I mean those really are the biggest contributors.
Kash Rangan
Thank you.
Satya Nadella
Yes, I am going to - if I add one thing, I will just say that nothing shows up in just one quarter. We have been working on this for a long time whether it is the product and the approach we have taken from IaaS to PaaS to SaaS, even the diversity of our SaaS offerings, and also how we think about going to market. All of these have been multiple years of hard work, and clearly there is momentum across the board, and that I think is what you are seeing and we are excited about this quarter's execution and performance, and I think it bodes well for what we do in the future, but the key is for us to recognize that this is about the sort of long-term commitment to a big opportunity in making sure that you line up your execution against that.
Amy Hood
And I think maybe, I should have also mentioned, when you think about seeing that type of performance and Satya mentioned it is not just because of work done this quarter, it is a great point, but it’s also the investments we’ve made. We’ve committed, we did sales overlays. We added technical resources. We put resources at customers ahead of the curve, we did that you saw that and the operating in the intelligent cloud OpEx growth over the past few quarters, that execution is what’s landing.
Kash Rangan
Clearly something inflected and looks like you're gaining share. So congratulations thank you.

Amy, going back to the size of the large size of the expiry base in Q4, when we look back three years to June 2014, in that quarter the commercial bookings grew 23%, I am just curious, is that representative of the portfolio that flowed through into this quarter on a three-year cycle, or is it more complex than that and also does it include or exclude LinkedIn contributions for the current period? And just finally, I’m wondering again looking back three years, it was a different number in the September quarter that follows. And could you help us just with the year-over-year growth of the expiry base for the September quarter, I’m not sure if you had commented on that?
Amy Hood
Okay, you are right, Mark it’s not exactly if I said is the Q3 from three years ago exactly the expiry base it is not exactly, but it is directionally. And so that’s a good example to say, every three years tends to be the length of our agreements and so you to tend to see that repeated, and that’s what we mean by sort of the record or the largest expiry base and that is the pattern. In terms of LinkedIn having any impact? It did not. So that is the cleanest way to think about that number.
Chris Suh
Thanks Mark. We’ll move to the next question.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital. Please proceed.
Ross MacMillan
Thanks very much and my congratulations as well. I’m actually going to ask a question about the traditional server products business, which once again had a pretty strong growth rate up 5%. I think the last three quarters you have been trending at mid-single digits or even higher, and Amy I just love your thoughts as we progress through fiscal 2018, just so we think about this in the right way, you know how would you expect that sort of growth rate to trend and should we be sort of aware of the comps that come up in Q2 and beyond?
Satya Nadella
Maybe I can start and at least give you what or how we think about it technically and product –wise, and then we can go into talking about the future in terms of the results itself. First of all, we don't think of our servers as distinct from our cloud. In other words, there is intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge is the architecture of pattern for which we are building, whether it is SQL server 2017 or with Windows server, the container service everything that we do assumes that distributed computing will actually remain distributed, and it turns out that it’s helpful to think about it that way both for customers who are rationalizing their portfolios of apps as they lift shift modernize as to what they run in their data centers are in our data centers, but also forward-looking new workloads. 
If you look at some of the most exciting things that are happening in the cloud, is cloud applications that actively require an edge Azure IOT, or Azure Stack are becoming the runtimes of the edge where you do need not only the ability to do compute and storage, but to run the AI inference and the edge. So to me that’s what we’re building to. It’s actually a big architectural shift from thinking purely as a migration to some public cloud to really thinking of this as a real future distributed computing infrastructure and applications, but I quite frankly feel very, very good about leading and so in that context our server license revenue will fluctuate based on what the macro is and these transitions and mix shifts, but from a forward-looking perspective, I want us to be very, very clear that we anticipate the edge to be actually one of the more exciting parts of what’s happening with our infrastructure.
Amy Hood
And so that leads why I always tend to say, I don't focus as much on the mix per se. I know both of them will matter and both of them are important, and so that’s why I tend to focus on that all up server KPI combination of the progress in the cloud, Azure, as well as the edge which is the on-prem. And so I think, we remain confident that double-digit target that we have for that KPI and is it really, I don't think sort of a comparability challenge per se, but that’s why we try to keep it at that high level to not get too tied to one or the other, given we know the TAM expansion that’s possible, we know we can grow within it.
And I apologize, I didn't answer Marks last component, so let me just go back and I had forgotten, which was, was there anything unique in the expiry base for Q1, the answer is, it is up a little year-over-year, but in certainly not through the same type of Q4 comparable. When we tend to have these, we tried to call them out like we did in Q3 leading into Q4. So, Q1 I would say is just up a little. So I wouldn't expect any material impact.
Chris Suh
Thank you, Ross. We will take the next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.
Raimo Lenschow
Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to drill in on the premium services in Azure, Satya you talked a little bit about SharePoint taking off and being a big part. Can you talk a little bit about the portfolio you have there, and I also wanted to contrast it a little bit with one of your main competitors who keeps coming up when new products just to kind of get to that premium service, and the advantage that you guys have given the IP that you build up over the years? Thank you.
Satya Nadella
Yes, I mean I think we have premium services whether it’s an Office 365 or in the SaaS side with a Dynamic 365 and that’s where the SharePoint comment came, but there is a lot more in Office 365 adoption cycle beyond exchange or email. On the Azure side, my comments in fact walked that entire tree so to speak, which is the infrastructure there wherein flat even in the infrastructure side there is no such thing as one generic infrastructure when I look at the diversity of the virtual machines, what’s happening with AI infrastructure with GPU compute. So there’s a lot of richness there. 
The layer about that for me is the data state, one of the exciting things is the growth in Azure DB, the growth in Cosmos DB, data warehouse product, the Datalake, so that is a place where we are seeing significant attach. On top of the data is where the AI services, where the bot framework, the cognitive services. So that’s all the rich services where we are seeing significant customer action. The other side of it is the edge, so Azure IOT, our service both in the cloud and the edge and Azure Stack now truly are starting this quarter is going to be another way to extend out the rich services of Azure even beyond public cloud deployment. 
So that’s what hopefully gives you a flavor for the IP that we have. And then one linchpin that we have between, in fact, our SaaS services, as well as Azure is Azure active trajectory. 90% of all the enterprises use Active directory and all of them rendezvous with Azure Active Directory irrespective of what applications they have in whichever cloud because that becomes a very key control plane for IT.
Raimo Lenschow
Perfect, thank you.
Chris Suh
Thanks Raimo. We will just have one more question Reyna, please.
Operator
Thank you. And our last question will come from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Please proceed.
Brad Reback
Great thanks very much. Amy, as the Azure business continues to gain scale and to Raimo’s question the premium mix continues to be kind of bigger part of that, is there any reason to think that the gross margin gain shouldn't accelerate in 2018 versus where they were in 2017? Thanks.
Amy Hood
Thanks Brad. The way I tend to think about it is, with any service you want the gross margin itself to improve, and that includes in the Azure services components themselves. The difference between core compute in-store versus the premium layers can be significant and we’ve had improvements across all of them. So, the real question on how and where should the Azure gross margin be is about sort of the ultimate mix of those.
Anyhow, we saw significant improvement this year. We expect a lot of improvement again next year on each of those service lines. And where the actual mix occurs among those lines, I think we will just have to wait and see, but that’s why I tend to not focus at that layer it’s like can you get every service better, can you make material improvement, and then of course can you get usage and consumption going that leads to premium service usage, and of course over time you’d expect a higher mix of premium versus core.
Brad Reback
Great, thanks very much.
Chris Suh
Thanks Brad. So that wraps up the Q&A portion in today's earnings call. As Amy mentioned, Frank and I will be hosting a conference call in early August to discuss the changes under the new revenue standards, you can find additional details for that on the Microsoft Investor Relations website when available.

Welcome to Microsoft's third quarter fiscal year 2017 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would like to turn the call over to Chris Suh, General Manager of Investor Relations. Chris, please proceed.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Reyna. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me today are: Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary.
On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provides a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.
As a reminder, this is the first full quarter of LinkedIn results. As a result, comparisons made to prior years will be affected accordingly. During the call, Amy will discuss the financial impact of LinkedIn as she provides an overview of business results for the quarter. Our key investor metrics remain unchanged due to the LinkedIn acquisition.
Unless otherwise specified, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's third quarter performance in addition to the impact that these items and events had on the financial results.
All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. We'll also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations.
We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website until April 27, 2018.
During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Thank you, Chris, and thanks to everyone on the phone for joining. Today I'll share the results of the third quarter and discuss what's ahead.
I'm proud of the progress this quarter. We delivered $23.6 billion in revenue, up 7% in constant currency. Across all industries, organizations are looking to digitally transform with the state-of-the-art cloud services, AI, and new natural user interface technology. Increasingly, these organizations are turning to Microsoft as a partner they can trust for the innovation and building their own digital capability.
Now let's look at the progress we made this quarter by segment, starting with Productivity and Business Processes. We crossed a major milestone with more than 100 million monthly active users of Office 365 Commercial. Office 365 Commercial seats grew 35% year over year, and revenue is up 45% in constant currency. Across industries, customers recognize Office 365 is the productivity platform of choice, companies like H&R Block, Johnson & Johnson, and Deutsche Börse AG, LVMH, as all chose Office 365.
And we continue to innovate and add new value. This quarter we made Microsoft Teams broadly available to Office 365 customers in 181 markets. Our new chat-based workspace is already empowering a new way to work for more than 50,000 customers, including Accenture, J. Walter Thompson, J.B. Hunt, and Expedia. Teams also creates a new platform opportunity for developers to reach 100 million Office 365 users with rich extensibility for bots, apps, and services.
Additionally, we are expanding the relevance of Office 365 to new segments. Retail, hospitality and manufacturing companies have a huge need to empower their front-line employees. Our expanded offering for this segment includes Microsoft StaffHub, Teams, OneDrive, Skype for Business, and more to give these critical employees a robust collaboration toolkit to maximize their impact.
Now let me talk about the second part of our ambition in this segment, reinventing Business Process. Accelerating our growth with LinkedIn by driving value for members and customers remains our top priority. This quarter we redesigned the LinkedIn desktop to create a more seamless intuitive experience across devices. We continue to invest in the LinkedIn Feed, bringing curated news and views to help members stay informed on what's most important to them. Our innovation across both the desktop and mobile is driving strong engagement momentum, with sessions up more than 20% again this quarter.
LinkedIn marked an important milestone this week, exceeding 500 million members, and our jobs platform hit new record levels with more than 10 million jobs posted. This strong momentum with jobs and engagement is continuing to fuel the growth across talent, marketing, sales, and learning solutions.
We took significant steps this week to redefine social selling with deeper integration of Sales Navigator with Dynamics 365, enabling sales professionals to dramatically increase their effectiveness by drawing on the relationships in their personal networks. Customers like Visa are choosing Dynamics 365 because of our deep integration across Office 365 and now Sales Navigator. I'm excited to put the Microsoft enterprise sales force and partner ecosystem behind this new opportunity.
Dynamics 365 solves a critical challenge for businesses, helping them break free of monolithic siloed suites of applications to unlock insights across the entire organization. You see this in our new Dynamics 365 talent applications, which combines HR business processes with LinkedIn Recruiter to help companies manage the employee lifecycle from recruiting to retention. Our innovation in Dynamics is driving strong revenue growth, with Dynamics 365 up 82% in constant currency this quarter.
Now let's talk about the progress we are making in our Intelligent Cloud segment. Our Commercial Cloud annualized revenue run rate now exceeds $15.2 billion. Customers are increasingly choosing the Microsoft Cloud. They value our differentiated approach as the most trusted global hyperscale cloud with hybrid support and higher-level services to help drive their digital transformation. Moreover, they appreciate the agility, operational consistency, and security across the entire digital estate, spanning enterprise mobility, Office 365, Dynamics 365, and Azure.
Take Maersk, the largest transport and logistics firm in the world with operations in 130 countries and a fleet of over 1,000 vessels. Maersk began their journey to the Microsoft Cloud with Office 365, Enterprise Mobility and Security in Windows 10. They chose Dynamics 365 for operations to streamline container production and maintenance. Now Maersk is using Azure to digitally transform its supply chain management and global trade. The intelligent services in Azure deliver up-to-the-minute insights on carrier performance and equipment usage with real-time data visualization and advanced analytics, enabling them to trim costs and create new revenue streams. For a company that ships 17 million containers annually, the ability to react quickly can mean the difference of tens of millions of dollars to the bottom line. This is a great example of our three clouds coming together to enable deep digital transformation.
Across industries, customers are choosing Azure. UBS announced they're using Azure for risk management, and GEICO chose Azure for hybrid capabilities. Publicis Groupe announced that they will use Azure and Cortana Intelligence Suite to deliver AI-powered marketing solutions at scale. Flipkart, India's this leading online marketplace, chose Azure as the platform to enable their rapid growth.
We continue to rapidly innovate and add new capability to drive further customer value. Microsoft IoT Central is the first SaaS offering that provides the end-to-end solution for organizations of all sizes to manage their entire IoT ecosystem across devices, cloud, analytics, networks, and software. This week at Hannover Messe, the world's largest industrial trade show, manufacturers showcased how they're using our solutions to transform all aspects of manufacturing, from water management to food and beverage packaging, to improving safety on the factory floor. When it comes to AI, this quarter we made our cognitive services for face recognition and computer vision broadly available to enable any developer to become an AI developer.
We're excited about how Azure Stack and SQL Server are helping define the edge computing paradigm. Azure Stack will enable customers to extend Azure capability to their private data center in a truly consistent hybrid computing environment. SQL Server 2017, coming this fall, is the first database with cloud tiering and artificial intelligence built in. It runs on Windows and Linux, supports docker container deployment and popular programming languages such as R and Python for machine learning and data science. We will share more about all these advances and more at our upcoming Build Developer Conference.
Now I'll turn to our progress in More Personal Computing. Almost two years ago we introduced a new approach with Windows 10, transforming the way customers experience Windows on all their devices. Now customers are always up to date running the most secure Windows ever. This quarter, the Windows business grew 5% in constant currency, and we delivered the next phase of innovation with the Creators Update.
Creators Update is about inspiring the creator in us all. We create technology so that others can create their own content and technology. We want to empower people to paint in 3D or paint with numbers in Excel. We empower people to create in Word or in Minecraft. These new forms of creation and expression are shaping Windows for the next generation.
Gaming is a key scenario to expand our opportunity across the PC and console. We are building on our already strong foundation with Xbox One and our Xbox Live community, up 13% to 52 million active users this quarter. With Creators Update, we integrated gameplay broadcasting into Windows 10 PCs as well as Xbox One. We're off to a very strong start with both streamers and viewers. In fact, the majority of the streaming in this industry today is on the PC and console, and we are uniquely positioned to provide the best, most complete gaming experience, from hardware to software to broadcast services. It's early days and we are excited to pursue this new growing opportunity. This quarter, we also revealed more about our forthcoming Project Scorpio, which will be the most powerful console ever and will enable true 4K gaming in the living room.
Our commercial customers continue to adopt Windows 10 as the secure trusted platform of choice. Customers like the Department of Education in the United Kingdom, British Telecommunications, the Adventist Health System, one of the largest healthcare providers in the United States, all chose Windows 10.
When I talk to businesses and government leaders, they value security and privacy of their data, the reliability of their systems, and choice and control over how and when they deploy. We remain committed to our core values of trust, transparency, privacy, and security for every customer.
Finally, devices; this quarter our Surface results fell short of expectations, impacted by end of product lifecycle and increased price competition. We continue to innovate and invest in creating new computers and computing experiences. Surface Pro, Book, Hub, Studio, HoloLens are all creating new markets for the Windows ecosystem and pushing differentiation with new natural user-interface capabilities, ink, vision, voice, touch, and mixed reality.
In the context of mixed reality, we just passed the one-year anniversary of Microsoft HoloLens. We now have more than 150 exclusive HoloLens apps in the store. Moreover, many of our commercial customers are using HoloLens to drive digital transformation and seeing real impact. HoloLens-based innovation was featured front and center at NRF, HIMSS, and most recently this week at Hannover.
Digital transformation across these industries is being shaped by new technologies, from IoT to mixed reality to AI and the cloud. thyssenkrupp Elevator is using HoloLens and Azure to digitize their entire sales and order process, shortening delivery times by four times, and they chose Dynamics 365 to enable transformation in their Steel division. Leading global medical technology company Stryker chose Office 365 to empower employees and is using HoloLens to improve operating room designs for surgeons, staff, and ultimately the patients. All this creates a strong foundation for the broader opportunity ahead with digital transformation.
I'm proud of the progress this quarter. I'm enthusiastic about what's to come. In the coming weeks, we will share more about how Microsoft is innovating uniquely to empower every customer, from students and teachers to business professionals to developers.
Now, let me hand it over to Amy to walk through this quarter's results in more detail and share our outlook, and I look forward to rejoining for your questions.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone.
Our third quarter revenue was $23.6 billion, up 6% and 7% in constant currency; gross margin grew 7% and 9% in constant currency; operating income grew 2% or 5% in constant currency; and earnings per share was $0.73, an increase of 16% and 19% in constant currency.
This was the first full quarter of company results of LinkedIn, which had a significant impact on revenue, gross margin, and operating income. At a company level, LinkedIn contributed approximately 4 points of revenue and gross margin growth and 6 points of drag on operating income growth, which includes $371 million from amortization of acquired intangibles.
From a geographic perspective, our results were mostly in line with macroeconomic trends. Our performance in Japan was better than expected, driven by increased public sector spending and improved market conditions.
Our commercial annuity mix was 88%, even with another quarter of higher than expected transactional revenue results. Commercial bookings increased 12% or 11% in constant currency. Commercial unearned revenue followed historical seasonal trends, coming in at $20.4 billion and growing 9% and 10% in constant currency. And our contracted-not-billed balance increased to more than $27.5 billion.
Another strong quarter of cloud services performance drove our commercial cloud revenue run rate over $15.2 billion, growing 52%. Our commercial cloud gross margin percentage increased to 51%, up 6 points from last year, with improvement across Office 365, Azure, and Dynamics. And gross margin dollars grew 74%, keeping us on pace for material gross margin percentage and dollar improvement this fiscal year. As a reminder, our commercial cloud includes Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and other cloud properties, but does not include LinkedIn.
Our company gross margin was 66%, better than anticipated and up 1 point, as the sales mix of higher-margin product and services coupled with commercial cloud margin improvement more than offset the impact of $218 million of LinkedIn amortization.
Now to FX. This quarter, the U.S. dollar was weaker than expected. As such, we had 1 point less FX impact across our individual reporting segments, even though overall company impact was still approximately 1 point as guided. FX impacted the Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud segments by 1 point and had minimal impact in More Personal Computing.
Total operating expenses grew 12%, with LinkedIn contributing 13 points of growth, including $153 million of amortization of acquired intangibles expense.
Now, let's move to the segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes segment grew 22% and 23% in constant currency to $8 billion, with LinkedIn contributing 15 points of growth. Office commercial revenue increased 7% and 8% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 45%, driven by installed base growth across all workloads and continued ARPU expansion. Our transactional results came in higher than expected, mostly from performance in large markets like Japan and Western Europe.
Office consumer revenue increased 15% and 14% in constant currency, primarily from recurring subscription revenue as well as growth in our subscriber base.
Our Dynamics business grew 10% and 11% in constant currency, with Dynamics 365 customer momentum contributing to double-digit billings growth.
LinkedIn revenue for the quarter was $975 million.
Segment gross margin dollars grew 15% and 17% in constant currency, with 11 points of contribution from LinkedIn, including $218 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Gross margin percentage declined due to a higher mix of cloud revenue and the impact of LinkedIn-related amortization.
Operating expenses increased 44% and 45% in constant currency, with 43 points from LinkedIn, including $153 million of amortization expense. Operating income declined 7% and 4% in constant currency, with 13 points of impact from LinkedIn.
The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered approximately $6.8 billion in revenue, growing 11% and 12% in constant currency. Server products and cloud services revenue increased 15%, up 16% in constant currency, demonstrating durable double-digit growth. Azure revenue increased 93%, up 94% in constant currency, and annuity revenue again grew double digits. Azure premium revenue grew triple digits for the 11th consecutive quarter, with more than 80% of Azure customers using our premium services.
Our Windows Server and SQL Server transactional business continued to perform well; with better than expected results mainly from Japan and continuing post-launch demand. As expected, Enterprise Services revenue declined 1% and was flat in constant currency due to a lower volume of Windows Server 2003 custom support agreements.
Segment gross margin dollars grew 6% and 7% in constant currency, and segment gross margin percentage declined due to an increasing cloud revenue mix and lower Enterprise Services margins, partially offset by material improvement in Azure margins. We grew operating expenses by 11%, with ongoing investment in sales capacity, cloud engineering, and developer engagement. Operating income was flat and up 3% in constant currency.
Now to More Personal Computing, revenue was $8.8 billion, declining 7%, as Phone and Surface results offset healthy growth in Windows, search, and gaming. Our OEM business grew 5% this quarter. OEM Pro revenue grew 10%, ahead of the commercial PC market, mainly due to a higher mix of premium SKUs. Additionally, the commercial PC market was slightly below our expectations, negatively impacted by channel production timing changes and upcoming Windows SKU pricing changes. Commercial end customer demand signals remain consistent and positive.
OEM non-Pro revenue declined 1%, ahead of the consumer PC market, with continued positive impact from the Windows Premium device category. Overall, inventory levels remain in the normal range.
Windows Commercial products and services grew 6%, with healthy enterprise demand as customers continued to deploy Windows 10 for its advanced security and management capabilities. Patent licensing declined this quarter, primarily from lower revenue per unit. Search revenue ex-TAC grew 8% and 9% in constant currency, driven by higher revenue per search and search volume.
Devices revenue declined 51%. We had no material Phone revenue this quarter. Our Surface business declined 26% and 25% in constant currency, as heightened price competition and product end-of-lifecycle dynamics resulted in lower than expected Surface Pro unit volumes.
Our gaming business grew 4% and 6% in constant currency, as Xbox Live revenue growth offset declines in hardware. Xbox Live monthly active users grew 13% across Xbox One, Windows 10, and mobile platforms, which contributed to software and services revenue growth of 7% and 8% in constant currency.
Segment gross margin dollars were flat, up 2% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage increased with the sales shift to higher-margin products and services. Operating expenses declined 11% and 10% in constant currency from lower Phone expense and Surface launch-related marketing spend in the prior year. Operating income grew 20% in 23% in constant currency.
Now back to overall company results, we invested approximately $2.1 billion in capital expenditures, including capital leases, less than we expected, as a portion of the expense will move into Q4. Other income and expense was $322 million, greater than originally planned, as we saw more opportunities in the equity market to realize gains during the quarter.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was approximately 23%.
We returned $4.6 billion to shareholders, continuing our balanced approach to capital allocation through share repurchase and dividends. After a period of accelerated buyback, we've resumed a buyback pace consistent with our historical trends.
Now let's turn to the outlook, first FX. Given current rates, we now expect less FX headwinds in our fourth quarter. We expect about 1 point of negative impact on total revenue. Within the segments, we anticipate about 2 points of negative impact in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and 1 point in More Personal Computing.
Second, our commercial business, the fourth quarter is an important one for our commercial business, and we expect continued annuity growth and healthy renewals as customers adopt and use our growing portfolio of Commercial Cloud services. We expect unearned revenue between $26.8 billion and $27 billion, in line with historical seasonality.
Additionally, we have a large expiry base in the fourth quarter, and our sales execution on renewals and upsell opportunities, while contemplated in our unearned revenue guidance, should also show up in a larger contracted-not-billed balance and commercial bookings growth.
Third, capital expenditure, we expect CapEx to grow sequentially and year over year. Quarterly spend variability will continue, and we remain on track for our full-year capital expenditure year-over-year growth curve to slow.
Let's move to the individual segments. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of $8.2 billion to $8.4 billion, driven by the ongoing annuity shift to cloud and Commercial Office 365. In Office consumer, we expect growth rates to moderate from prior quarters, which were impacted by prior-year comparables. We expect consistent growth from Dynamics and approximately $1.05 billion of revenue from LinkedIn, adjusted for the impact of purchase accounting. Similar to Q3, we anticipate that LinkedIn, excluding amortization, will have minimal impact on segment operating income, and we continue to expect it to be minimally dilutive to non-GAAP EPS this fiscal year.
In Intelligent Cloud, we expect $7.2 billion to $7.4 billion in revenue. Performance trends from Q3 should continue into Q4, with annuity strength and double-digit revenue growth across our server products and cloud services. Enterprise Services should decline with lower volumes of Windows Server 2003 custom support agreements.
In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue of $8.4 billion to $8.7 billion. In our OEM business, we anticipate that revenue growth will be more aligned with the overall PC market. OEM Pro growth will continue to be driven by Windows 10 Enterprise momentum and aligned to a commercial PC market that should return to typical seasonality. Our non-Pro revenue is expected to be above the consumer PC market, with continued benefit from a strong mix of premium devices.
In search, we expect Bing's revenue growth ex-TAC to be similar to Q3.
In gaming, we expect to see continued healthy user engagement on our Xbox platform, and we look forward to E3 in June, where we will share more on Project Scorpio and new titles for next fiscal year.
And in devices, we expect revenue to decline with negligible revenue from Phone. With Surface, we expect a more moderate rate of decline given the prior-year comparable and current market dynamics. We expect COGS of $8.2 billion to $8.3 billion. This includes approximately $420 million of LinkedIn COGS, of which $220 million is related to amortization. We expect operating expenses of $9.1 billion to $9.2 billion, with roughly $1 billion from LinkedIn, of which $150 million is related to amortization.
We now expect full-year operating expenses between $32.9 billion and $33 billion, with approximately $2.3 billion from LinkedIn. That includes about $360 million of amortization expense.
Other income and expense should be about $150 million. And for tax, we expect the full fiscal year non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 21% plus or minus 1 point.
Finally, we encourage you to watch a few upcoming events, our Education event on May 2, our Dynamics 365 event on May 3, and the upcoming keynote from Bill to learn more about our ambitious plans leading into FY 2018. We will also host our financial analyst briefing on May 10. The webcast will be available our Investor Relations website.

Thank you. Our first question comes from line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Excellent, thank you very much for taking the question and a very nice quarter. I wanted to dig into Azure a little bit. You gave us some really interesting statistics about gross margins going up, premium mix going up. One of the concerns I hear a lot from investors is what happens when we get these price cuts that go back and forth between you guys and AWS? It doesn't seem like the price cuts this quarter really affected you guys. So I was hoping you could shed some light on how – to what degree do those price cuts actually affect you.
And then on the flip side, where does all that growth come from? Where do you get that tripling of premium growth from what kind of workflows are coming on board to actually drive the underlying growth in that business?
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Sure, thanks for the question, Keith. Let me start and then, Amy, if you want, you can add. Again, Keith, when we look at either the capital expense or the technical architecture, and the general approach we take is about all of our cloud. When you look at what we're trying to get done between Azure, we don't really see these themes across Azure or 365, Dynamics 365, and also the things that we're doing with Xbox Live, for example, all billed as one cloud infrastructure and a set of rich services in the cloud.
So for example, some of the cognitive capabilities that are there in Azure first come because of our first-party AI investments, whether it's been speech or vision or anything else. Even the infrastructure that is there in Azure came out of some of our first-party investments in Office 365 or again Bing in other areas. So we have an approach which takes all of our cloud pieces together.
And that same thing is reflected even in the customer journeys. I think the Maersk example I walked you through is probably a good one, where it may start with some commodity workload on Azure or it may start with Office 365, but then it will end up with HoloLens and someone using Dynamics 365 for increased automation. In the case of Maersk, they were using field service and operations inside of Dynamics 365.
So to me, those high-level services will over time attach in Azure, but also in Dynamics as well as in Office 365. So to me, that's why Azure is pretty strategic for us, not just for the attachment of high-level services in what is defined as Azure, but the all-up digital transformation opportunity. That's how Amy and I even think about our margin structure. We need to improve in each one of the elements, but all-up we need to improve because we think that increased opportunity is what's unique about our approach.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And I think what you're hearing in that answer from Satya, Keith, is really about whether the premium services exist as you heard at the Azure layer, or whether they show themselves in our Productivity and Business Processes segment.
The fact that you may see competition where there may be less differentiation, the real differentiation is where you've always been able to achieve margin and margin expansion, which is in the completeness of the solution or its delivery, the completeness of the business process change or not. And so I think while I do understand that people will ask a lot about that price competition at the lower level, I think what you're seeing is because we're able to continue to move people up the stack, including all the way up to the business process layer, I think you'll continue to see us be confident in our ability to move and create margin and growth.
Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Outstanding, thank you very much.

Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hi, thanks. I've got a follow-up, actually, on Azure, maybe to you, Satya, and it's the interplay between the cloud piece Azure and mostly the on-prem piece, what you guys call the server product. Most of your peers obviously, when they're pivoting to the cloud, are seeing weakness on the on-prem side. But what's unique about Microsoft is not only is Azure growth accelerating, but your server product growth at 7% is up meaningfully year over year as well, so we're not seeing that trade-off with Microsoft. I suspect part of the explanation is that a lot of the Azure growth is net new, but I'm just curious. When do you think customers will actually start migrating existing on-prem Microsoft workloads into Azure such that that server product line might start to decelerate? Do you think there's a prospect of that occurring in fiscal 2018? Thank you.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Yeah. The timeframes of these migrations and so on are a lot more complicated than they perhaps appear on the surface. So here's what we think of. For example, right when everyone's talking about the cloud, the most interesting part is the edge of the cloud. Whether it's IoT, whether it's the auto industry, whether it's what's happening in retail, essentially compute is going where the data gets generated, and increasingly data is getting generated at the volumes in which it's drawing compute to it, which is the edge.
So if you look even at our announcements over this quarter, a lot of what we have done with IoT is create an IoT edge. Of course, we have an amazing cloud with the SaaS services for IoT, but the edge compute, the ability to run a neural network at the edge, do inferences at the edge is exciting. Azure Stack is going to completely change what hybrid is and the expectations customers have with hybrid. I mean, GEICO example is a good one.
What's happening with SQL Server, SQL Server is no longer just about a database that's on-premise. It's a database that's on-premise that can be tiered with the cloud. A single table can be extended to the cloud. The queries will work across both the tiering. And so to me, the innovative work we're doing is what I would characterize as the future of true distributed computing, which is it will remain distributed. And that's what we are building towards. We'll talk a lot more and build on that about that architecture and what we're seeing with customers.
Then given that what you are saying is true, which is there will be some which will be lift and shift of workloads, but then there is lift, shift, and modernizing of workloads. And in that modernizing phase, it's not just being modernized to live only in what is called a cloud, but it will also be modernized to live in the edge of the cloud. And so that's the transformation at play. That's a multiyear and a generational transformation. Quarter to quarter, there will be all kinds of volatility. But what is clear to me and clear to Microsoft's engineers is that we have a very clear world view of what is it that we want to get done, and we stay focused on it.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And I think, Karl, to your question about how that shows up, it's why you hear us focus more on the all-up KPI between Azure and this transactional or on-premise number, because the line between them, both strategically and literally, is more important to be blurred and going in that direction. And so this quarter, you saw a little bit healthier than we had thought, I pointed out. It tends to be – in this instance, Japan was a little better. It can be product-launch related. It can be macro-impacted. But whether or not you see that in transactional, the Uber trend of being able to see it through the all-up KPI, the dynamic Satya has talked about, you're going to hear us talk more and more about, whether it's a quote-unquote, on-prem server launch or an Azure feature, about the integration of the two.
Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Perfect, thank you.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.

Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great, thank you. Again, I had a follow-up on Azure as well. I was just wondering, Satya, if you could share with us – and I know I've asked this in the past – but just any qualitative commentary you could give us about PaaS adoption. And I'm also wondering in particular, given the high percentage of workloads on Azure running Linux, what type of services are you typically seeing run on top of the OS? And how do you see your monetization of those workloads playing out over time?
And then, Amy, just the follow-up for you would just be – and I apologize, we had another earnings call tonight, so I might have missed it – but you usually give a comment about out-year OpEx on the call, and I was just wondering if you had any high-level thoughts there. Sorry, thank you.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Sure, Heather, thanks for the question. Overall qualitatively, in terms of PaaS adoption of Azure, a lot of it comes with what's happening, for example, in the services we talk about, like IoT. We now have a much higher-level managed service. We even launched a new packaging of it with the IoT Central, which allows developers who are building IoT solutions, instead of assembling it themselves to be able to use this managed service to be that much more agile and productive. So that's usually the way we make the atomic parts available as well as these essentially SaaS services or PaaS services.
Same thing with data, the DocumentDB is a massive thing for us. It's the planet-scale database that supports JSON and much more, and we see that as a core part of the data tier for many, many applications. We even see, obviously, the end-user parts of the infrastructure when it comes to enterprise mobility. So all-up, we have multiple pieces.
The other areas, course, the entire toolchain of what's happening with Visual Studio to continuous integration, to continuous deployment, and that's a place where we have a very, very differentiated solution for developers and developer productivity, which in some sense you can think of as like the Office 365 for developers. But that's all part of Azure. So those are the places where there are PaaS services.
But as I said earlier in response to the question, we also welcome the use of, I'll say, the most atomic building blocks of Azure, whether it just be a Linux container, Azure functions, which is very cost-efficient for developers, because we know that over time, it may be not just PaaS services in Azure, it could be in fact a Dynamics 365 module. The canonical example for me is someone who collects data, does a prediction, ultimately then has to do something about that prediction, which means some automation like field service. So a lot of what is Dynamics field service is actually in our module growth we are seeing because of Azure IoT, and that relationship is not just about Azure PaaS.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And to your specific question, Heather, on FY 2018 and OpEx, I did not because we're going to see each other and have more time on May 10 at the analyst briefing, and that's where I'll take some more time to walk through FY 2018.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.

Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.
Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Thank you, excellent, two questions. What were the drivers of the big growth in Dynamics 365? Is this large seasonality specifically in this quarter? Is it a big deal, or should we expect growth in the same vicinity for the near future?
And then as a second question, as discussed in, one of the previous questions about Server & Tools and the healthiness of that growth, I'm trying to understand the drivers. Is this the product refresh cycle? Is it Azure driving customer upgrades? Is it something else? Can you give a bit more color? That would be helpful. I appreciate it.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Sure, Mark, and let me start and then Amy, you can add. On the Dynamics 365, we're at the very, very beginning phase of the transition of Dynamics from primarily being on-premise to now being a very modern modular SaaS service. The Dynamics 365 momentum is picking up. I talked about the revenue growth rate, and that's definitely going to be what's going to be true in the quarters to come and the years to come.
But we do have a huge on-premise base. There is still a need for those on-premise products. That will continue, but our focus is on transitioning to the cloud. And you've seen us do this successfully with Office 365. You've seen us do that with Azure. And now we're ready to do that mainstream across what has been traditionally known as CRM and ERP without in fact us thinking and talking about those suites because we think that is a pretty old concept to have suites like that, which is we have now really made the entire Dynamics 365 much more modular, modern, and much more efficient for customers. So that's what's happening in Dynamics.
Same thing on Azure, which is – the driver is – a lot of it is net new. IoT, for example, was not a workload on the old server world, whereas it's one of the big workloads for us. Same thing with AI, not an old workload. So there's new growth in Azure. There is the lift, shift, and modernize motion as well, as well as a new need for the edge of the cloud. So all three of them are in play, while recognizing we had a large business called the Server Licensing business. So we have three new things that we're driving and a lot of large licensing pieces that are just transitioning into these three motions.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And in particular, in this quarter, how to think about I think some of the in-period outperformance versus what we see consistently, in the bucket of consistently, premium workload growth has been consistent for us. The double-digit annuity growth has been consistent for us, and that I think is a driver we continue to look for and be confident in its execution quarter to quarter.
In the more temporal bucket this quarter as well as last you saw a bit of it, some geo help in certain geos that may see and be more transactional in nature. Japan happens to be one of those geos. And then we are still seeing some post-launch impact, specifically on the Windows Server side and selling higher-end SKUs post-launch, which has to do with some of the value inherent. So that's how I break down the drivers, Mark.
Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Excellent, I appreciate it. Thank you and congrats.

Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed.
Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Hi, thanks, two things, Amy. I think you mentioned in the script that Windows – there was some Windows volatility around some new SKU pricing. Could you go into some detail there?
And then secondarily – I know we may get this at Analyst Day, but around ASC 606, I knew you're going to adopt that early, and I think that will change to some degree your annuity revenue. I wondered if you could give us any color, even directionally, on what percentage of that annuity revenue is licensed that after ASC 606 will go up front.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Great. On ASC 606, we will talk about it in detail actually on May 10 in terms of the timing and what you can expect. You will also note in the 10-Q this quarter, we do give a look at the initial impact on an annual basis, using last year as an example.
The biggest difference on an annual basis with the adoption of ASC 606 will really just be the change from Windows OEM. Now what we will talk about in more detail is that the quarter-to-quarter results in any given year will be a little bit more volatile. But over any annual period, the biggest difference will really just be the change in some ways back to how we thought about OEM revenue. So that's what I would think of on ASC 606.
Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
And then a question on...
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Windows, I'm sorry. I answered them in the opposite order. And on the Windows pricing, which we talked about, we do and always have worked with Windows SKUs as we release new products and add new value. This quarter, we had a bit of a mix shift to a higher-end SKU. And starting in April, we've introduced other SKUs that have more value in them at lower processing specs. And so what you'll continue to see is that would normalize. Even though we saw some high-end SKUs this quarter do well, I would expect in Q4 to have the normal breadth of those SKUs and revert back to looking much more like the commercial PC market itself.
Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Great, thank you.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.

Our next question comes from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Please proceed.
Brad Reback - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Great, so two quick questions. First off, Amy, there's been a lot of talk about tax law changes on the corporate side. Would a repatriation holiday impact how you guys allocate capital back to shareholders?
And then just real quickly, on the OpEx side, I know you don't want to get too specific, but over the last few years you've been able to effectively reallocate upwards of $2 billion from the Phone business elsewhere. Is there still a fair amount of ability to reallocate internally? Thanks.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Great, let me take both of those. Let me separate your first question because I think you're really asking two that I probably don't relate as directly, and I should do that for you. We've been a longtime advocate of structural tax reform, and so we'll just wait and see how things play out. And as decisions get made and proposals clarified, we'll share more about what that means for us.
Next, in terms of how we thought about that impacting capital return, as you know, I think we've been and executed a significant capital return program over the past couple years, including accelerating the buyback program that I think I feel very good about at the corporate level in terms of the value it's created. And so I wouldn't say that I view those two things as waiting for one to do the other. We've in fact continued to do what we thought created the most value for shareholders, which is to invest in ourselves, acquire companies that help us expand our TAM and grow, return dividends, as well as repurchase shares. And we've continued to do that this quarter as well. I think you'll continue to see us take a balanced approach, but I don't think of those as being related.
The last question on OpEx, I think over the past couple of years, we've continued to make decisions that said every dollar we spend, are we putting it in the right place for the long term, whether that's reallocating or adding new. And what we expect is to grow new markets and perform really well in them with every dollar that we invest, whether, frankly, Brad, it's in OpEx or in COGS. At this point, both of those are very large buckets of investments, which Satya and I as well as the whole senior leadership team spend the majority of our time picking markets and making sure we execute in them.
So in terms of our ability to continue to do that, of course there are opportunities. We learn, frankly, I think every week where we can do better and where we can continue to invest to accelerate. That being said, I don't view any OpEx number as a constraint. More I view, is the return healthy? Is it growing the top line? Are we executing well on it? And if we are, it will make sense to spend more and if we aren't, it won't. And so I tend to take that approach as opposed to solving for any one number.
Brad Reback - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Great, thanks very much.

Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.
Kirk Materne - Evercore Group LLC
Thanks very much and congrats on the quarter. Amy, I want to follow up on your last point around investment and return on it. Around this time last year, you guys started spending a lot more or investing a lot more in OpEx on the Intelligent Cloud side in particular. This quarter, you saw Intelligent Cloud operating profit on a constant currency basis get back to growth again, which I think shows that those investments indeed made some sense.
Now that you have spent a lot, you've obviously added a lot in sales and marketing resources, R&D resources on that front. Could you just give us I guess qualitatively how you're thinking about that? It seemed like last year, you needed to catch up to a certain degree in terms of go-to-market capabilities. Do you feel better I guess where you are today versus your position, say, a year ago, just in terms of being able to capture the opportunity on the Intelligent Cloud side? Thanks.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
I'll start and then I'll transition to you, Amy. I don't view it that narrowly quarter to quarter or even year to year. These are generational opportunities that what's at play when it comes to the Intelligent Cloud or what's happening in augmented reality. Either one of those things, I think if we started viewing it quarter to quarter or year to year, we'll completely miss the trend. We definitely need to be smart about two things that Amy said before, which is pick markets that are secular growth markets and got big TAM. And most importantly, what's our role in it? Is this something that the world needs Microsoft to be doing, or is it well served by others? That's where we spend most of our cycles in.
The fact that we put some salespeople and then there's increased productivity is something that we obviously celebrate and we track very closely. But the places where we are more likely to go and put our OpEx in the coming quarters, in the coming years are going to be about revenue that's going to show up for multiple years out. And it won't be very transparent to you, and that's how it is. If we had not gotten started on some of the distributed computing infrastructure in a completely different place, we wouldn't have even had Azure. But I completely understand that all of you measure us to what we have done for you lately. And that's a fine way and we'll keep account of it, but that's not how it works.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
I think the important part in what Satya says is the distinction between really engineering investments that take multiple years of investment and world view on a TAM and holding ourselves accountable to sales and marketing investments. And are they earning the right return? Are we doing them in the right way? Are they in the might market? Are we investing in the right types of people, in the right capabilities?
What I look and say that this number shows is that we are doing and it is encouraging that the plan that we put in place, that the sales team has done a really terrific job of executing on. And all that does is build more confidence that both we've picked a good market and we're investing in the right type of people to make sure we land that opportunity at customers. And then the most important thing is that the customers' success is what will breed revenue for the next quarter, the next year. And especially in this market, a generational move here really means, especially for many of the workloads being moved, these pay off every year for the next 10.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Great, thank you, Kirk. We'll go to the next question, please.

Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yes, thank you very much. Satya, I'm curious, how is the pace of the conversations around Internet of Things, machine learning, and cognitive services? And also, what are you seeing as the killer app types of use cases that could resonate with customers in terms of the more mainstream applicability?
And also, Amy, just given the strength in commercial bookings and also commercial bookings guidance, macroeconomically do you see any signs of enterprise budgets opening up somewhat or different activity levels, more receptivity to transformative projects? I'm just trying to understand maybe how we can separate out your company-specific momentum against any conceivable incremental macro tailwind.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
That's great, so let me start. The best way to think about how people are using, whether it's Azure or Dynamics 365 or other capabilities we have, is in the context of that digital transformation and the outcome. So when you say killer apps, the killer apps are how are customers able to reimagine how they think about customer engagement, how they think about employee empowerment or the operational efficiency, or how they can change the products and the business models and the products.
And if you look at even the examples I used in this quarterly earnings call, Maersk and what they are trying to do across all of those is pretty transformative. There is machine learning in AI. There is IoT. There is new type of business process automation with operations. All of that is transforming Maersk. What thyssenkrupp has done in their Elevator business and other business units by using anything from HoloLens to a front-line worker to how they're fundamentally moving their business model from essentially the margin on the thing to the margin on the service, which has machine learning and AI built into it. Those are the killer transformation opportunities that we are seeing.
And in fact, it's not about in fact taking any old workload per se, but it's about reimagining what they want to do across these. And in that context, of course, they're lifting and shifting some of the older workloads, but they're modernizing the entire business process flow. And that's what's I think the killer opportunity, not any one technology, but the entire flow.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And I think your question about is it really budgets, I think you used the phrase opening up. What I think is really interesting is, I don't know, I read probably the same CIO surveys you all do. Frankly, the numbers in those in terms of IT spend or intent to spend, they aren't much different than we've seen. For me, what I think is missing in that question is really – it's not about any one customer saying wait, I'm going to spend 2% more or 3% more. These are companies actually deciding that the change is required, not from an infrastructure perspective, but to change how they're running their business itself.
And so things that used to look more to them like capital expense or COGS or not just an IT budget, this is literally changing every business process they run or changing the services they offer, and thinking about literally driving their revenue differently. And so I don't really associate it probably as much with a quote-unquote, budget that sits in IT very narrowly. This is really about every budget that sits not just in IT, but under every functional leader of a company being spent differently and being spent on our technology.

Our next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks very much. Two, I think both for Amy. The first is that now that Azure gross margins have turned positive, would you say it would be reasonable to assume that the Creative Cloud gross margins should continue to increase sequentially going forward, or could other factors still create some volatility quarter to quarter?
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Overall, we continue to expect each service is going to get better and better. That happens from two things, premium mix revenue doing well, as well as the efficiencies we expect to get in COGS resulting in gross margin improvement.
Now to your specific question on can you expect it every quarter sequentially, the answer is not really. The mix amongst the services will always result in a pacing change. And so while year over year you may not see as much, but you will see more sequential volatility as, frankly, you've seen over the past six quarters, even when we've seen improvements in each of the underlying and underlying services, which tends to be how I focus on it a bit more.
Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC
That's helpful, and maybe one other, if I could. Just on CapEx, I know there was a timing delta here between Q3 and Q4, but I just wanted to step back. If you think about your CapEx plans ex-LinkedIn as you came into the year and how you think you'll end up, are you going to be about on plan, or do you think you'll be above or below? Thanks.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks. In general, for the full fiscal year, we'll be right at or a little below where I thought we would have been, and so that's why the full-year perspective that growth will slow is still on track. And for simplicity, I generally would think about all the delta from Q3. I would encourage you just to move it into Q4 as you think about what to expect.
Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC

Our last question will come from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
Philip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Awesome, thanks, guys, for sneaking me in. Just a question on Office commercial. You guys reported another strong quarter here, about 8% constant currency growth. And, obviously, you're continuing that acceleration that you've had over the first three quarters of this year. Now, I guess the question to Satya and then Amy. Satya, you still have a positive mix shift going on here because we see the unit count growth, but also the revenue growth, so positive spread there. Maybe help me walk through where you think we are in this life cycle of Office 365 because you obviously have a lot of SKUs.
And then, Amy, in that context, to the last question on gross margins for commercial cloud. Obviously, we've made a lot of headway on Azure. How do think where we are similarly on the life cycle on the gross margin side of Office 365?
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Yeah, I can start. I think with Office 365, we are trying to expand the appeal of Office 365 on multiple dimensions. A lot of what we are still seeing in play is the rapid adoption or the increased adoption of Office 365 E3, which is what I think is driving a lot of the growth, the ASP growth. Now we have a good start with what is at the high end of the enterprise value, which is E5, some of the value we have. Whether it's voice or analytics and security, it resonates. And we're learning, we're improving, and we're pushing forward on that front.
At the same time, we're also introducing new SKUs for the front-line worker. This is one of the other first-time trends I'm seeing where CEOs are more interested in productivity of their front-line workers, and so that's another exciting space. It comes at a different ASP point, so it's not exactly the same as E5, but very important for us strategically to be able to increase the appeal of Office 365. We also are working to make Office 365 and seeing good traction in segments like small business.
The other aspect of Office 365 which is important for us is the international element because we really never had very high penetration of our higher-end service SKUs in the international markets. And we finally get to do that with the service offering. So those are all the areas. Where there's significant room left – and we're not just standing still in terms of adding value for new segments, so those are all in play.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And the way you've seen that, and I'll relate it to margins, is this continued and consistent installed base growth, and even still having the opportunities Satya laid out. And most of the ARPU improvement that we've seen has been, in fact still due to the E3 transition, not due to the E5 transition. So we still feel quite good about the opportunity, especially in some of the customers that have already moved to E3.
And then in terms of gross margin, margin actually here has been steadily improving. We've been in this business a bit longer and it's more mature. I do think here the opportunity is also ARPU-based actually here in terms of continuing to see margin improvement is continuing raise the dollars per user that we realize to continue to see that grow.

Welcome to the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 Microsoft Corporation earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would like to turn the call over to Chris Suh, General Manager of Investor Relations. Chris, please proceed.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me today are: Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary.
On our website, microsoft.com/investor, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provides the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.
Microsoft completed the acquisition of LinkedIn this quarter and is reporting its results in the Productivity and Business Processes segment beginning on December 8, 2016. Accordingly, our key investor metrics do not include the impact of LinkedIn. Additionally, for Q2 only, we are providing non-GAAP results excluding LinkedIn to help investors compare results to the guidance previously provided for the quarter. Our press release and slide deck contain supplemental information regarding the impact of LinkedIn on our financial results.
Unless otherwise specified, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's second quarter performance in addition to the impact that these items and events had on the financial results.
Additionally, any mention of operating expenses refers to segment operating expenses as defined in the footnotes of our Form 10-Q, which include research and development, sales and marketing, and general administrative but excludes the impact of integration and restructuring charges. All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. We also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations.
We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following today's call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website until January 26, 2018.
During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Thank you, Chris, and thanks to everyone on the phone for joining. Today I'll share the results of the second quarter and discuss what's ahead.
We had a solid quarter overall, delivering $26.1 billion in revenue, up 4% in constant currency. More importantly, we are making progress by innovating in new areas, growing our addressable market opportunity, and transforming our culture.
Wherever I go in my travels, whether it's in conversations with heads of state, NGOs, or CEOs, the common thread is the transformative power of digital technology to unlock new opportunity. Everyone I meet is talking about building their own digital capability to transform their products, service, and business model. They're looking to Microsoft for security, productivity, business process, cloud, and AI platforms to help drive their own transformation.
In this last quarter, we have continued to build momentum across all of these areas, and in particular AI. Just this month we acquired an AI deep learning startup, Maluuba, whose work in natural language processing will help advance our strategy to democratize AI for everyone.
With that as a backdrop, I'll turn to progress we have made this quarter by segment, starting with Productivity and Business Processes. Office 365 commercial seats grew 37% year over year and revenue is up 49% in constant currency. We're changing the nature of work, with Office as the universal tool kit to help people and teams accomplish more together. To that end, this quarter we introduced Microsoft Teams, our new chat-based workspace for Office 365. It brings together the full breadth and depth of Office 365 as well as connections to third-party services, all in a secure hub for teamwork. We are seeing strong demand for the preview from our existing Office 365 customers due to the deep integration of the rest of the Office platform. And at the same time, customers not yet on Office 365 are excited about this new way to work to see Teams as a potential first cloud workload.
In addition to collaboration, our innovation and security and compliance continues to drive customer preference for Office 365. This quarter we added new capabilities to give IT better ways to help their users safely connect to third-party applications. And for compliance, new eDiscovery capabilities make it easier and faster for organizations to find and analyze information related to legal and regulatory requests.
Customers also find value in the integration of SharePoint with PowerApps and Microsoft Flow to quickly and easily build mobile apps and automate workflows. In fact, just eight weeks after availability, we have seen more than 0.5 million people use PowerApps or Flow. This combination of productivity, security, and agility is incredibly valuable to customers, particularly in sectors like financial services and healthcare.
Take Willis Towers Watson, a global financial services firm, who chose our premium enterprise offering, including Office 365 E5. Global Fortune 500 companies TD Bank and AXA as well as Partners HealthCare and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center all chose Office 365 for its powerful security and productivity platform. And AstraZeneca recently upgraded Office 365 E5 for its advanced voice capabilities.
We're also expanding our growth opportunity beyond information workers by creating productivity solutions for retail, restaurant, hospitality, and manufacturing employees, who have traditionally been underserved by technology providers. Microsoft's StaffHub, a new application in Office 365, provides shift scheduling, messaging, and sharing capabilities for all these front-line workers.
Now let me talk about the second part of our ambition in this segment, reinventing business process. We completed the acquisition of LinkedIn in December, marking the start of our journey to bring together the world's professional cloud with the world's leading professional network. Our top priority is to ensure we innovate and drive value for LinkedIn members and grow their daily engagement. The LinkedIn business solutions, hire, market, sell, and learn, represent an expanded market opportunity for Microsoft, and we plan to diligently execute on this opportunity, keeping the member-first ethos in focus.
We are seeing good results with the core experience, with our revamped mobile app driving significant engagement growth in 2016. This quarter, the sessions on LinkedIn grew more than 20% year over year, a consistent level of growth throughout 2016. We also achieved record levels of mobile page views and feed interaction, creating a healthy foundation for LinkedIn's marketing solutions, which include the rapidly growing Sponsored Updates.
We also saw members engage with LinkedIn's hiring products at record levels as part of talent solutions. And LinkedIn's sales solutions have also seen rapid growth, with Sales Navigator seats up more than 20% year over year during the quarter. Sales Navigator's success on multiple CRM platforms makes it an essential tool for every B2B salesperson and one of our first integration scenarios will be to redefine social selling by enhancing Dynamics 365 with LinkedIn capabilities. The combination of LinkedIn's business solutions and Dynamics 365 gives us a more comprehensive portfolio of business SaaS solutions and strengthens our position in this growing and competitive market.
Dynamics 365 paid seats more than doubled again this quarter and new enterprise customers are increasingly choosing our cloud solutions, with more than 80% choosing Dynamics 365. DefenseReady is using Dynamics to give military leaders a 360-degree view of their organizations to quickly make informed decisions about capacity planning, and operations. Amway is using Dynamics 365 to modernize and empower their entrepreneurial sales force around the globe.
Now let's talk about the progress we are making in our Intelligent Cloud segment. Our commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate now exceeds $14 billion, and we're on track to achieve our $20 billion in fiscal 2018.
Customers choose the Microsoft Cloud for the following reasons. They want a trusted global hyperscale cloud provider that meets enterprise-grade needs. They want hybrid support that is architected into the hyperscale service as well as the cloud service. They want higher level services to help build their own digital capability across IoT, enterprise app dev, advanced analytics, and AI capability. Moreover and most importantly, CIOs, CSOs, BDMs, and developers are all seeing the benefit from operational consistency, productivity, and security across their entire digital estate, spanning Windows 10 Cloud and Security Management, Office 365, Dynamics 365, Enterprise Mobility, and Azure.
A prime example is Mars, a $35 billion business with 60 brands. An early adopter of Office 365, Mars is using Office and Windows 10 to transform how its 80,000-strong global workforce collaborates while staying secure. And more recently, they have begun running mission-critical workloads on Azure with hundreds more on the way, including inventory management using Azure IoT. Swift Transportation, one of the largest trucking companies in the United States, is digitizing work for nearly 20,000 drivers with Office 365 and Skype and is using Azure to harness the data from their sensor-equipped trucks to optimize driver productivity and safety.
Across industries, we continue to see strong customer demand for our differentiated cloud solutions. Azure revenue grew 95% in constant currency this quarter. Azure premium revenue grew triple digits for the 10th consecutive quarter, and more than three out of four Azure customers are using Premium services.
We are also leading the next-generation programming model in developer services innovation with conversational bots, microservices, and event-driven serverless compute to help businesses rapidly gain the benefits of cloud infrastructure. Our bot framework is being used by more than 77,000 developers to do everything from e-commerce to customer service. Azure functions is helping companies like AccuWeather and Plexure to quickly and easily implement business-critical event-driven serverless processes. And everyone from game developers to financial services companies are using Azure Service Fabric for their low-latency high-scale microservices applications.
We're also rapidly expanding our portfolio of data and AI capabilities in Azure. Cognitive services, now deeply integrated with Azure Data Lake, enables customers to use industry-leading AI capabilities to easily analyze images, text, emotions, speech, sentiments at terabyte scale.
In our push to meet the needs of any developer on any platform, we joined the Linux Foundation, welcomed Google to the .NET Foundation, and announced a new Azure partnership with OpenAI to accelerate our vision.
At the edge of our cloud, Windows Server 2016 and SQL Server 2016 give enterprises Azure-inspired scale and innovation for secure infrastructure and cloud applications. Customers have already deployed more than 1 million instances of Windows Server 2016, and the new SQL Server drove a 5X increase in developer downloads in Q2 versus Q1.
Now I'll turn to our progress in More Personal Computing. This quarter, we saw growth across Windows broadly. First, Windows 10 commercial customers are rapidly adopting Windows 10, driven by their need for a secure and trusted platform. In fact, this quarter enterprise and education deployments increased 52%. Accenture, Broward County School District, UnitedHealthcare Group, are just a few that are choosing Windows 10 as their modern, secure enterprise-grade platform. These three commercial customers alone have already deployed more than 300,000 seats with commitments to deploy over 0.5 million.
The consumer PC market is also stabilizing. Gamers are increasingly turning to Windows 10 premium PCs for the best gaming experiences, logging more than 26 billion hours of game play on PCs and tablets this year. One reason gamers love their Windows 10 PC is because they can connect to their favorite games and social network on Xbox Live. Xbox Live monthly active users grew to 55 million this quarter, a new record, with growth across PCs, mobile, as well as the console.
Windows 10 Creators Update will bring 3D, mixed reality and game broadcasting to all Windows 10 customers. Partners like Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Acer are investing to deliver cutting-edge virtual reality experiences for customers using Windows 10 Holographic platform.
We are also broadening our opportunity through partnerships with chipset makers Intel as well as Qualcomm, who have committed to build the next generation of modern Windows PCs with advanced security, connectivity, AI, mixed reality, and gaming.
Our services innovation and user engagement on Windows 10 continues to grow. Users have asked Cortana more than 18 billion questions to date, and we are opening up new addressable markets with Cortana Devices SDK. BMW, Renault-Nissan, Harman are all using Cortana to embed voice-activated intelligence into their portfolio of products.
Finally, let's talk about devices. I'm excited about the customer reception to Surface Studio, our latest innovation in the Surface line and a new device category. Overall commercial demand for Surface remains strong, with three consecutive quarters of more than 25% growth. Organizations across industries are looking to Surface to help them achieve more, such as Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs in the United Kingdom rolling out Surface to more than 25,000 of its employees.
We're expanding into new markets with HoloLens. Commercial customers like ThyssenKrupp Elevator are using HoloLens to enable servicing up to four times faster than ever before, and we look forward to making HoloLens available in China in the first half of this year.
As customers embrace these new computers and computing experiences, we're generating enthusiasm for Windows 10 and new forms of expression, creativity, and gaming that it can unleash.
I'm proud of the progress we made this quarter and during the entire first half of the year. We look to the second half with a clear focus on execution and innovation. We have a significant opportunity this year and beyond for growth across every one of our segments. We're uniquely positioned to build the technology to help every person and organization take advantage of new innovations like AI and use them to drive their own growth and transformation.
Now let me hand it over to Amy to walk through this quarter's results in more detail and share our outlook, and I look forward to rejoining you for questions.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to reiterate that my commentary reflects our performance inclusive of approximately three weeks of LinkedIn results. For this quarter only, I will comment on our results excluding LinkedIn for consistency with the guidance provided last quarter. I encourage you to reference our earnings slides for supplemental information.
Our second quarter revenue was $26.1 billion, up 2% and 4% in constant currency. Gross margin grew 3%, up 5% in constant currency. Operating income grew 5% or 8% in constant currency. And earnings per share were $0.83, an increase of 9% and 13% in constant currency. Excluding LinkedIn, our second quarter revenue was $25.8 billion, up 1% and 3% in constant currency. Gross margin increased 3% and 4% in constant currency. Operating income grew 8% and 11% in constant currency. And our EPS was $0.84, increasing 11% and 15% in constant currency.
Our investment agility and execution focus resulted in strong performance this quarter. From a geographic perspective, our results were largely in line with macroeconomic trends, with additional benefit from a healthier PC market, particularly in the commercial segment.
Our commercial cloud services drove our annuity mix up slightly year over year to 84%, even with better than expected transactional revenue performance. Commercial bookings increased 7% or 12% in constant currency. Commercial unearned revenue met our guidance range at $21.1 billion, growing 8% and 9% in constant currency, even with an FX headwind of approximately $150 million due to the strengthening U.S. dollar through the quarter. And our contracted-not-billed balance reached an all-time high, exceeding $28 billion.
Our commercial cloud revenue run rate grew to more than $14 billion, up 49%. Our commercial cloud gross margin percentage was 48%, up 2 points from last year, largely driven by improvement in the Azure gross margin percentage. And gross margin dollars grew again, increasing 62% across the commercial cloud. We remain on track for material gross margin percentage and dollar improvement this fiscal year.
Now to company gross margin, gross margin was approximately 62% inclusive of LinkedIn, up slightly from the prior year. This quarter, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to major currencies created additional negative FX impact on total and segment level revenue. On total revenue, FX had a 2-point negative impact, a point more than expected, with no additional impact from LinkedIn. In both Productivity and Business Processes and the Intelligent Cloud segments, the FX impact was 2 points, 1 point more than expected. And in More Personal Computing, FX had a 1-point impact, in line with expectations.
Total operating expenses grew 1% and 2% in constant currency. Excluding LinkedIn, operating expenses declined 2%, also 2% in constant currency. Operating expenses were under our guidance range primarily due to a favorable one-time legal settlement and FX benefits.
Now let's turn to each segment. This quarter, revenue from our Productivity and Business Processes segment, which includes LinkedIn, grew 10% and 12% in constant currency to $7.4 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue increased by 5% and 7% in constant currency, as Office 365 growth again outpaced the shift from the on-premise business. Office 365 Commercial revenue increased by 47% or 49% in constant currency, driven by a combination of install base growth across all workloads and ARPU expansion.
We also continued to see higher than expected results from our transactional business, in part due to an improving commercial PC market. Office Consumer revenue grew 22% or 21% in constant currency, as we continued to see an increase in our subscriber base and growth of recurring subscription revenue. In addition, the higher growth rate this quarter was aided by post-launch inventory drawdown in the prior period.
Our Dynamics business grew 7%, up 9% in constant currency, and our Dynamics 365 install base more than doubled. LinkedIn revenue for the three-week period from December 8 to the end of the quarter was $228 million. Segment gross margin dollars grew 5% and 6% in constant currency, while segment gross margin percentage declined due to increasing cloud sales mix as well as roughly a point of impact from LinkedIn. Operating expenses grew 13%, 14% in constant currency, driven by the LinkedIn acquisition. Operating income declined slightly but was up 1% in constant currency and up 7% in constant currency excluding LinkedIn.
The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered $6.9 billion of revenue, growing 8% and 10% in constant currency. Server products and cloud services grew 12% and 14% in constant currency, with strong momentum in our Azure business and another quarter of double-digit annuity revenue growth. Post-launch demand and purchasing ahead of currency driven pricing adjustments contributed to a higher than expected transactional revenue, mainly from Windows and SQL Server 2016.
As expected, Enterprise Services revenue growth declined this quarter 4% and 2% in constant currency due to lower volumes of Windows Server 2003 service agreements. Gross margin dollars grew 2% and 4% in constant currency. And segment gross margin percentage declined due to an increasing cloud revenue mix and a lower Enterprise Services gross margin, partially offset by material improvement in Azure gross margin. We grew operating expenses by 12% and 13% in constant currency, with continued investment in cloud engineering, sales capacity, and developer engagement. Operating income declined 7% and 4% in constant currency.
Now to our final segment, More Personal Computing, revenue exceeded our expectation at $11.8 billion, primarily from stronger than expected performance from our Windows business. Overall, revenue declined 5% and 4% in constant currency. Our OEM business grew 5% this quarter. OEM Pro grew 6%, better than we anticipated, driven by an improving commercial PC market and enterprise demand for Windows 10. OEM non-Pro grew 5%, ahead of the consumer PC market, as our partner ecosystem continued to see growth and share gains in the Windows premium device category. Inventory levels remain normal. Windows commercial products and cloud services grew 5% and 6% in constant currency, with double-digit annuity billings growth and install base expansion.
Patent licensing declined this quarter, driven by lower unit volume and revenue per unit.
Our search business ex-TAC grew 10% and 11% in constant currency, with improving profitability and continued growth in Bing from higher revenue per search and search volume.
In our devices business, revenue declined 35%, down 34% in constant currency. Phone revenue declined 81%, and we closed the sale of our feature phone business during this quarter. Surface revenue was down 2% and flat in constant currency, as we continued to phase out the Surface 3 device. Importantly, Surface gross margin dollars grew 6% and 17% in constant currency from an increasing mix of Pro 4 and Book replacing Surface 3 in the portfolio.
In gaming, revenue declined 3% and 1% in constant currency due to lower console hardware pricing and Xbox 360 volumes. In this holiday quarter, as Satya mentioned, we reached an all-time high of active Xbox Live users, which helped to drive our gaming software and services revenue to 18% and 21% growth in constant currency. This marks our first $1 billion quarter of digital transactions for our gaming business through our Universal Store across Windows 10 and Xbox One.
Segment gross margin percentage and dollars both increased this quarter. Gross margin dollars grew 3% and 5% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage expanded with the continued shift to higher-margin products and services. Operating expenses declined by 12%, also 12% in constant currency, from lower phone expense, a one-time legal settlement, and reduced marketing spend. Growth from Windows 10, the shift toward higher gross margin products and services in devices and gaming, and disciplined operating expense management resulted in operating income growth of 33% and 37% in constant currency.
Now back to our overall company results, we invested $2.5 billion in capital expenditures, inclusive of capital leases, as we continued to support customer and partner demand across our commercial and consumer services. During the quarter, other income and expense was $186 million. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22%. We returned $6.5 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends, completing our prior $40 billion share repurchase program this quarter, as we committed.
Now let's turn to the outlook, first FX. We had originally expected FX rates to lessen going into H2. However, given current rates, we expect continued currency headwinds for the rest of the year. For Q3, we now expect about 1 point of negative impact on total revenue. Within the segments, we anticipate about 2 points of negative FX impact in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud, and 1 point in More Personal Computing. In Q4, we anticipate about 2 points of negative FX impact on total revenue, 3 points in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud, and 1 point in More Personal Computing.
Second, our commercial business, we expect our commercial cloud services to continue to drive annuity growth as we expand our install base, grow consumption, and execute well on renewals. We expect commercial unearned revenue of $20.2 billion to $20.4 billion, in line with historic seasonality. We continue to expect some volatility in our transactional business due to macroeconomic conditions and the ongoing shift to the cloud.
Third, CapEx, we will continue to meet customer demand by expanding data center capacity while driving efficiencies through new technologies. With the addition of LinkedIn, we expect our capital expenditures, including capital leases, to grow sequentially to support a broader portfolio. For the full year, including LinkedIn, we continue to expect the CapEx growth rate to be lower than last year.
Let's turn to our outlook for the individual segments. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of $7.65 billion to $7.85 billion. This reflects the continued annuity shift to the cloud with Office 365, Dynamics double-digit billings growth, and LinkedIn revenue of approximately $950 million, adjusted for the impact of purchase accounting.
In Intelligent Cloud, we expect $6.45 billion to $6.65 billion of revenue, with continued annuity strength and double-digit revenue growth across our server products and cloud services.
Enterprise Services revenue should decline again due to a lower volume of Windows Server 2003 service agreements. And in More Personal Computing, we expect revenue of $9.05 billion to $9.35 billion.
In our OEM business, we anticipate revenue growth will exceed the overall PC market. Continued growth in Pro, driven by enterprise momentum for Windows 10, should be roughly in line with the commercial PC market, with some additional benefit coming from the prior-year inventory build. Our OEM non-Pro performance should grow ahead of the market due to strength in the premium device category.
In Search, we expect Bing's revenue growth ex-TAC to be similar to Q2. As a reminder, total search revenue growth will slow now that we've passed the one-year anniversary of our Yahoo! deal and the associated change in revenue recognition.
And in Gaming, we expect normal post-holiday trends, with declines in hardware console volumes and pricing balanced by higher engagement, usage, and transaction volume.
In Devices, we expect revenue to decline, driven primarily by phone. Surface revenue is expected to decline slightly with our ongoing Surface portfolio mix shift to Pro 4 and Book.
We expect COGS of $8.35 billion to $8.45 billion, including approximately $400 million of LinkedIn expenses. LinkedIn COGS include approximately $220 million of amortization of acquired intangible assets.
We expect operating expenses between $8.5 billion to $8.6 billion, with about $970 million from LinkedIn. The LinkedIn expense includes about $160 million for the amortization of acquired intangible assets. For the full year, we now expect operating expenses of $33.1 billion to $33.3 billion, with about $2.3 billion from LinkedIn. The LinkedIn expense includes roughly $360 million of amortization of acquired intangible assets. Other income and expense should be $150 million.
We continue to expect our full-year non-GAAP tax rate to be 20% plus or minus 2 points, with variability driven by the proportion of services revenue versus licensing revenue, the geographic mix of revenue, and the timing of equity vests.
Before moving to Q&A, I'd like to announce that we will hold a financial analyst briefing for the investor community in conjunction with our BUILD Developer Conference in May here in Seattle. We will share more details as we get closer to the date.
Chris, let's move to Q&A.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Amy. We'll now move to the Q&A portion of today's call. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Excellent, very nice quarter, guys, and thank you for taking the question. I wanted to ask a question about LinkedIn and what our expectation should be for achieving revenue synergies on LinkedIn. It seems like there's a lot of really interesting things you can do with that asset in combining it with your own portfolio. And how should we think about the potential for achieving some expense synergies? Obviously, there's a big cloud base that you could utilize under their assets, and Amy, you've always been very good at keeping expenses very well managed. So just as we go forward past the forward quarter, how should we think about the timeframe for achieving those benefits?
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Yeah. Let me start, and then I'll turn it over to Amy to talk about the specifics of the synergies. The core focus, Keith, for us to start with is to ensure that the innovation roadmap we have is all driving member value. The core ethos of LinkedIn needs be about member-first. How do we increase the engagement on the mobile flagship application as well as the revamped desktop experience that's now rolling out? We think that's at the core of being able to in fact then have all of the revenue – have revenue growth in their business solutions with across higher market sell. So that's how I see it. It's a two-sided market which starts with the health (35:02) of membership and member engagement.
And that is where the product roadmap, whether it's the integration with Office 365 or Dynamics 365, we'll be staying focused on it. We expect to see that roll out pretty rapidly. And as far as the guidance we have given at close in terms of what to expect, for example around EPS impact, those are things that we'll stay committed to. And I'll let Amy add more to it.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Yeah, I think Satya is correct. The guidance we gave at the time of the announcement in terms of EPS dilution on – excluding the impact of purchase accounting, being minimally dilutive, 1% plus or minus, stands, including the goal to achieve synergies where they make sense as we continue to focus on growing the core business and keeping it incredibly healthy and realizing the revenue synergies that we know exist across the businesses.
As a reminder, the two biggest impacts of purchase accounting, one is it does impact the deferred revenue. So the in-quarter revenue and the guidance will look a bit lower due to that, as well as the amortization of intangible expenses, which will also hit. We'll take care to give you insight into those so that you can continue to hold us against the goals we set for ourselves.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Thank you, Keith. We'll move to the next question, please, operator.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please proceed.
Brent Thill - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks. There are a number of investors that had been wondering about the sales reorg that takes place February 1. Perhaps this has been a worry that's been overstated. Can you just give us a sense? Are there changes that are happening that will take place February 1 that are different, or is this a minor tweak to the go-to-market going forward?
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
I can comment on it. I'm not particularly sure exactly what's happening on February 1. I would say the overall change that we are going through, and this has been ongoing for I would say the last multiple years, is transforming our field engagement model, where we're putting a lot more technical depth in the front-line sellers so that they can engage, whether it's data specialists, cloud specialists, security specialists, or even productivity specialists. Because it's super-important for us in this phase when people are looking for solutions to help them visually transform, for us to have a very fundamentally different type of capability in terms of our sales, and that's the transformation. And so we have really reorganized ourselves, both in the headquarters and in the field, to be able to recognize that shift.
What used to be large accounts for us, for example, are not by PC count anymore, and that's a pretty fundamental change. It's by consumption of cloud capacity in many cases. And this is happening all over the world. So that's the transformation that you will increasingly see us push forward, and no status quo on any part of Microsoft's organization should be counted on. If anything, we'll push to make sure that we are addressing what is our growth opportunities pretty aggressively.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And I think, Brent, in terms of there being a date, a very particular date, this is something, to Satya's point, we've been doing in a step function improvement over time for the past couple years, and we'll continue to do it. And the guidance certainly doesn't imply any type of slowdown in the commercial business. In fact, in some ways, it actually includes an acceleration in certain areas. So I think that's how I tend to look at it.
Brent Thill - UBS Securities LLC
Thank you.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Brent. We'll take the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great, thank you very much. Amy, you noted a material improvement in Azure gross margins this quarter. I was just wondering if you could share with us. I guess given how quickly revenue is growing in this area, how fast can we see margins ramp, which obviously were negative? And now that you're getting to some big revenue numbers, is there any reason why at a similar revenue scale you shouldn't be able to match the gross margins of what AWS, what you can back into from the financials of AWS? Can you walk us through the puts and takes? And then once you hit that scale point, is it something that we should see inflect pretty quickly? Thank you.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Heather. Let me start by saying we really do think about and talk about our cloud as containing all of the components, from the IaaS layer to the platform layer to the SaaS layer. You'll hear us talk about Dynamics 365, Office 365, as well as our Azure core and premium services.
And so when I think about the material gross margin improvement we saw in Azure, it continues the path we've actually been on where we've been discussing, as you continue to see customers ask for us and our help in managing their digital estate, consistently, securely through one interface, you'll actually see growth across all components of that cloud. It benefits margin, not just in Azure but across actually the entirety of the cloud. That 2-point year-over-year increase in the commercial cloud gross margin really, even with the massive growth in Azure over the course of the year, certainly implies the improvement that we expected. But I tend to think you will consistently hear both Satya and I refer to our cloud in its entirety. But I do respect people always wonder, so I did comment that we saw material improvement in Azure specifically.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thank you. Amy, I'm going to ask another question on gross margins, but this time at the Microsoft level. So your prior guidance was for ex-LinkedIn fiscal 2017 gross margins to be down 100 basis points. So the quarter you just posted gross margins ex-LinkedIn were actually up. And if I ran the math accurately, it looks like for your March quarter ex-LinkedIn, you're expecting gross margins to be about flat. So it feels like you're outperforming the core Microsoft gross margin guidance you gave before. So are you sticking with the down 100 basis points or has that improved? And if it has, what are the one or two biggest drivers of the gross margins feeling a little bit better ex-LinkedIn? Thank you.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Karl. I am sticking with it being about a point. That's the guidance we gave. And even inclusive of LinkedIn, I continue to believe it's about a point. So in some ways, I guess you could say it implies slightly better at the company level, if that's how you're thinking about it.
Really, Karl, what can drive that in addition to the overall gross margin improvement we talk about in the cloud, it's also really the strength we see in our Windows business. And I mean that not just in our OEM business but also across the commercial business for Windows. That tends to have a very good margin profile. And as we continue to improve the margin profile of our devices, we continue to see the OEM business health improve. And actually, we continue to see the growth in the consumer services around the transactions that run through Xbox is also good margin business for us that looks quite different than the hardware profile. So all of those can impact it, Karl, as we look through the rest of the year. But in general, inclusive of LinkedIn, I'm still around 100 bps.
Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.
Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Thank you, congrats on the strong quarter and thanks for taking the question. So, Amy, the on-premise Server & Tools business grew 5%, 7% in constant currency. It was obviously helped by Windows Server 2016 and SQL Server 2016. How should we think about on a longer-term horizon over the next 12 months or even longer how those two should help on the on-premise license or annuity business, on the cloud in Azure? How should we think about the impact of that? Thanks.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Mark. Let me start by saying it's why we tend to focus all up at that server products and services KPI being double digits generally an easier way for us to talk about it all up between Azure and the on-prem business. But let me talk a little bit about what impacted the transactional business this quarter, and then we can talk about how to think about it in Q3 and maybe going forward.
We did and we're encouraged by the customer reaction, even our transactional customers, to the security and management value prop as well as the hybrid nature of our SQL and Windows Server 2016 releases that have taken place this year. That value prop is resonating. We saw some growth. I feel very good about that. And so I do think that can have an impact in H2. You heard me talk a little bit about it. With the major currency changes we saw in Q2, we've also done some price adjustments between certain geos for us. It did pull forward a bit of revenue into Q2. And so it will be a bit of a drag on Q3, which is taken into account in the guide. But I would reiterate the biggest driver of the transactional performance this quarter was really the value prop people saw.
Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed.
Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Hi, thanks. Amy, I'm wondering if you can talk about – we're still seeing the majority or really all the growth in operating profits come from MPC on a year-over-year basis. And I'm wondering how we should think about the factors impacting and the timing in the handoff of profit growth from MPC to IC and PBP, if that's something that you expect. What are the factors and timing there?
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Right, I would say actually we've also seen some operating income growth in our PBP segment this quarter, up in constant currency, 7% before LinkedIn. So I do want to say some of that impact is absolutely landing as well as growth.
But the heart of your question is really about the MPC transition and IC. The way I think about it, we really – Satya and I and the leadership team decided, gosh, about 18 months ago – it's been a little longer than that now, to over-index on investing because of the TAM we saw in the Intelligent Cloud. We increased hiring and we invested in direct customer acquisition cost. We invested in many of the things Satya just talked about in terms of technical capabilities and our sales force. We're starting to see the benefit of that already in our top line numbers. That 12% or 14% in the server product and services KPI is a very good number. And I continue to expect that we'll see growth in revenue as those resources both get hired, get up to speed, and add value at accounts.
A lot of that account value frankly, Walter, today is coming in the form of consumed revenue. Consumed revenue is actually a great leading indicator for what we expect our Azure growth going forward to be. And so some of the confidence I think that we have in the transition of that investment in operating expense into even more revenue growth comes from seeing the consumed revenue trend that we're seeing today as well as the pipeline of projects and customers that we have. And so I do think about that being an 18-month investment we've been making. It's starting to pivot to consumed. It will then land as billings and ultimately in our P&L as GAAP revenue in-quarter off the balance sheet.
But I think you're right. We have been working and continuing to reinvest and save through the year as we look to get everything here more efficient. People often think we focus on cut here, add here. It's also about, are we putting every dollar most efficiently to help customers be successful? And I think that's a lot about what you heard Satya talk about the sales transition we're going through, whether it's how we build products. And so I actually am confident you'll start to see that transition land.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
I think Amy described it well in answering the very specific technical question about segment reporting and the margins in it. But architecturally, some of the examples I used are about the digital estate that actually doesn't start with Azure. In many cases, it starts with advanced set protection of Windows 10 estate. And then how does that relate to Office 365? How does that relate to Azure Active Directory? And then the workloads that they want to put, which are Tier 1 workloads in Azure.
It's very similar to what happened even in the client server era, but of course the starting points and how this progresses is very different. So we are always thinking at least of the technical architecture that makes us unique and differentiated spanning all of it. And so I don't think of it as margin shifts across the segments, and that's why we think of all of this as one digital estate at least from a customer-end perspective.
Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yes, thank you. Satya, I'm wondering what you think would be required to extend the hyper-growth trajectory for Azure into the future. For example, are there incremental waves of activity on the horizon that you would tie to Tier 1 workloads or large data center migrations or serverless usage which would enable that?
And separate from that, Amy, I'm curious just philosophically. How do you plan to handle price cuts for compute and storage when they occur? Do you think you're better off matching them, exceeding them, or does it make sense perhaps warranting a premium in many cases due to the differentiated IP that you have up the stack?
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Yeah, let me start. Overall, I think some of the trends that you've referenced, whether it's Tier 1 workloads or serverless or even complete data center migrations, all of that is happening. Even the customer examples I gave, they were littered with example after example.
For example, in FinServ, some very Tier 1 trading applications now using some of our capabilities in service fabric, which is really a PaaS service, which allows you to manage microservices with low latency and high scale, that's a place where we are seeing in fact activity, whether it's game development or trading applications. We are seeing even interesting use cases of Azure functions, which is completely serverless. In fact, you can think of it as a price cut for anybody who cares about being very, very smart about cloud consumption. Going serverless is something that we in fact advocate.
So across the board, I feel we have the right mix of IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, and per user SaaS services like Azure Active Directory, which gives us the right mix to be able to even have the right margins long term. We're not concentrated in any one layer of the stack, which is something we do by design because our vision has always been that we want to of course offer all of these layers, and customers will choose depending on their needs and their scenarios. And we are now seeing even a single customer estate spanning all of these.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And, Mark, I'm not sure I want to get into our pricing theory on the call on a go-forward basis in terms of whether or not we match competitors. But what I would say is really fundamentally related to Satya's point around differentiation of the entire stack and what customers are doing in their digital estate. And the ability to earn margin through that is actually more impactful than whether or not you match pricing at the core.
Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi, congrats on finishing up a great quarter as well. One for you, Amy, and one for you, Satya. One, Amy, when I look at your comments on gross margin, clearly you're not in a position to break out Azure-only gross margin. But I'm wondering if we can take a composite of (52:37) your commercial cloud. Targets are about $20 billion. So if I take what I believe could be a rough split between Azure versus the SaaS segment and look at the best-of-breed companies, I could get about 70% – 75% gross margin when you hit your targets. I'm curious what you think about that. Is that too aggressive or within the ballpark?
And for you, Satya, as cloud computing moves to the enterprise, there's some belief among investors that AWS is going be a big, strong competitor in the enterprise, which is typically not a stronghold for them. How do we think of Microsoft's enduring strength in the enterprise? And how confident can we be that you should be able to capture your fair share of enterprise workloads as they move to the cloud? Thank you.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Let me start with the second part, and then you can add.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Yes.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
So, Kash, the way I think about it is, even in the client server era, we had tough competition. We had Oracle. We had VMware, and we had many other players we competed with and I grew up competing with. And we now have AWS I think who is going to be a credible competitor. So I feel that, as I said, we have a cloud strategy that is not just about infrastructure. It is about really SaaS and infrastructure. And we want to uniquely think about what are the things that we can do to differentiate and add value to our customers' digital estate in the cloud in that context. And that's where, if you will, our fair share will come from by competing hard where we have to but also mostly thinking about differentiation.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And in terms of is there a long-term gross margin cloud number that is industry-leading, I think right now there's a benchmark in the SaaS community that's probably around the number you talked about in terms of more SaaS applications. And then as you go down through the layers from PaaS to IaaS, that margin declines, obviously much as it did when that was run as a hardware solution. The margins weren't as high either. And so I do think it will be a blend of those. But certainly at the SaaS end, I understand where you get that benchmark from.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Great. Thank you, Kash. We'll take the next question, please.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.
Philip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. Just wanted to focus back in on Office 365 on the commercial front. You had another strong quarter of revenue growth obviously at 49% constant currency, but it continues to meaningfully outpace the seat growth, which is still strong, about 37%. So that commentary that you all had given about premium mix in the past, two questions here. First to Satya, when you think about where we are in the progression, call it up to E5 so to speak or E3, how do you think this plays out? And how do you think about the mix of unit growth versus that premium mix and translating it to revenue?
And then to Amy, I guess I'd argue that maybe we've done the low margin or low gross margin parts of the Office 365 transition. And now as this mix goes up, you're actually not just increasing revenue, but the margin is better too. Is that fair? And then how do you tie that back to your commercial cloud gross margin expectations long term?
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Yeah. I can start. On the product side, we think of actually three things we are trying to do on a continuous basis in Office 365. First, even for the customers who are already on Office 365 at any given licensing level, we focus quite a bit on their increased usage and intensity. So for example, one of the comments I made in my remarks was, for example, SharePoint with PowerApps and Flow. That's to us to the best way for us to keep having that recurring value. And so we focus quite a bit on adding additional value even to the existing licensing levels and increasing intensity of usage.
Then things like what we are doing to even go to non-knowledge worker audiences in retail or in manufacturing with some of the things that we're doing with staff scheduling for example. That's a way to expand seats even beyond what is the traditional knowledge worker. Of course, we have significant more opportunity in small and medium sized businesses, although we have had good healthy growth there. I think seat growth will come more from material increases internationally as well as with some of the regulated segments of the market finally moving to the cloud. Those are all opportunities ahead.
And then the last one of course is the new value in things like E5 with voice or analytics and security. So all those three dimensions, there will be variability quarter to quarter in terms of what's happening. But in terms of our investments in that core product value, it is actually happening on all those three.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And to your point on where we are and what's driving that delta and its consistency, frankly, over time, actually still the biggest impact is from the transition to E3. Transitions take time. And so you're just starting to see some of the impact from E5. We're excited about all the customers in trial and are already starting to use the value, whether it's security, increasingly analytics, and ultimately voice. But really from an ARPU perspective, the biggest driver continues to be the transition to E3.
And so then that leads to your question on do you continue to believe there's some margin expansion possible as you add newer and higher value workloads. And of course, the answer to that is we do believe that, but it certainly comes over a period of time and run through our annuity base over that pace.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillian with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks so much and congratulations from me as well, two questions, one for Amy first. When we look at CapEx, it actually declined year over year ex-capital leases, but even with capital leases the growth rate decelerated. And for the full year, it's obviously a pretty wide range, roughly zero to 40% growth. I'm just curious, Amy. With LinkedIn, have you made any changes to your CapEx assumptions for core Microsoft? And I guess I'm pointing to the fact that it did seem to decelerate quite a lot this quarter. And I wondered if there's any additional color you could frame around the growth rate for all-up CapEx plus capital leases. Thanks.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Sure. Let me first comment on that I've said it will be lower than it was previously. I certainly would help you in that number and say a little lower, just so that you're getting into something closer. I realize zero to 40% is not as helpful.
I would also say that it does tend to be lumpy, and it's why I don't give very specific guidance every single quarter, and it was not at all impacted by LinkedIn. Our real goal for LinkedIn is – over time of course I'm sure they'll want to take advantage as we build new services together of some of our infrastructure assets. But in the short term, the most important thing is they continue to add value and usage and great experience for their members. And so I have really no intention of messing with that in terms of capital expenditures in the short and next six months for sure. So I think what you're seeing in terms of year over year and what does it mean for next year, this next quarter, it will be a sequential increase, but again, it is a bit lumpy.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Okay. Thank you, Ross.

Thank you. And our last question will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.
Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hey, thanks for squeezing me in and congratulations as well. I wanted to ask on Windows 10. Satya, you talked at the beginning about customers starting to adopt it, and you mentioned three large ones already. Can you talk a little bit about that cycle and how you see everything that's unfolding and what the customer feedback is in terms of their intention to adopt it now versus waiting for a little bit? Thank you.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
I think the overall adoption cycle of Windows 10 in the enterprise is perhaps the best that we have seen in the enterprise for any new release of Windows, and primarily driven by security and manageability of the new Windows, and that's what's been the driver.
But in addition to that, I must say there are two other things that are increasingly becoming fairly relevant in the adoption cycle, which is moving to both Office 365 and Windows 10 and getting essentially to this new frontier for productivity, which is an always up-to-date operating system, which is secure, and an always up-to-date Office experience that is a SaaS service. We're increasingly seeing that resonate, not just in small business and some of the high-tech industry as it has been in the past, but now even in the regulated parts of the enterprise. So we are very excited about that.
The other piece also that's driving is hardware innovation by the entire ecosystem. In fact, the work that we did with the Surface line has really stimulated the entire ecosystem to do some of the best innovative work, and you saw that even at CES. And the enterprise adoption of these new devices is also driving the overall excitement around Windows 10 and Windows 10 innovation.

And with that I'll turn the call over to Satya.
Satya Nadella
Thank you Chris and thanks to everyone on the phone for joining. Today I will share the results for the first quarter and discussed how we are innovating into growing each of our segments. Overall we are off to a good start in FY '17. We delivered $22.3 billion in revenue this quarter, an increase of 5% in constant currency. I am proud of the continued progress.
Our platforms are leading profound digital transformation outcomes for both people and organizations. At our IT conference Ignite, I talked about how we are innovating in AI across the entire text back and how I will be infused into everything we do. To accelerate our innovation we've created a dedicated organization to focus on artificial intelligence. As I turned to progress we made by segment this quarter, I will highlight how these investments we're making in AI fuel innovation across all of our ambitions.
Let's start with productivity and business process. We're helping people be more productive by bringing intelligence to familiar office apps they use every day. We recently introduced cloud power intelligence within Word, Excel, PowerPoint and outlook that uses machine learning and advanced natural language processing to help automate related content and connections focus your inbox and more easily create compelling content.
We are also building intelligence into our apps to provide advanced security for customers. This quarter we announced Office 365 threat intelligence which analyzes billions of signals across office Azure Windows and external data sources to give customers broad visibility into attack trends and proactively recommend security policy adjustments. We're extending intelligence to compliance with our new data governance service which helps customers achieve organizational compliance and automate data retention.
These advancements are part of our ongoing commitment to strengthen security for Office 365 customers. We’re seeing broad momentum with customers across enterprises, small business and consumers. Monthly active users of Office 365 commercial are now over 85 million, up more than 40% year-over-year. Office 365 commercial seats were also up 40% year-over-year and revenue up 54% in constant currency. Across industries, customers such as eBay, European airline, jet, global pharmaceutical company, Allergan, the Fortune 100 companies like the energy leader Exelon and Liberty Mutual Insurance are choosing Office 365 to help make their employees more productive and secure.
Customers love the power of office on any device. We now have more than 45 million outlook monthly active devices on iOS and android more than 70% increase year-over-year.
Last week we unveiled a new class of purpose built intelligent apps in Dynamics 365 designed to remove any impedance that exists between productivity, collaboration and business process. Using advanced analytics a machine learning, these new apps glean insights from previously siloed data to transform how people work across finance, sales, marketing and customer service. They monitor customer relationship help, reveal connections, forecast demand and predict risk and the deep integration with Office 365 makes it easy to take action communicate and collaborate in real time or schedule a follow up.
Our innovations the Dynamics 365 build on our existing momentum, dynamics online paid seats more than doubled year-over-year and customers increasingly prefer our cloud solutions with more than 70% of the new dynamics CRM and ERP enterprise customers choosing dynamics online. Companies like HP, Inc. are replacing their existing CRM systems with Dynamics 365 to take advantage of the built-in intelligence and our latest release and transforming engagement with customers and partners. Overall, we are well positioned to compete and grow our Sarah in this large and growing market.
Now let's talk about the progress we are making in our Intelligent Cloud segment. Customers continue to choose the Microsoft cloud to help transform their businesses and organizations. Our commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate now exceeds $13 billion, and we remain on track to achieve our goal of $20 million in fiscal year 2018. Once enterprise customers choose one of our cloud services they continue to adopt more services.
More than 60% of the fortune 500 now have at least three of our cloud offerings, up 20 points year-over-year. And as with last quarter, we continue to grow our commercial annuity mix which is now at 88%. Customers choose Microsoft for three reasons. They wanted trusted global hyper scale cloud provider to meet the enterprise grade needs, they want hybrid support that is architected into both the hyper scale service and the cloud servers, they want higher level services to help them build their own digital capability inclusive of DevOps, productivity, new IOT and enterprise app development, advanced analytics and machine learning in AI capability.
These differentiated features are leading our cloud infrastructure growth. As revenue once again through to build it just wanted to 21% in constant currency with Azure compete usage more than doubling year-over-year. We continue to invest in and expand our data center footprint which now totals 38 regions including the announcement of our planned expansion into France and the recent opening of data centers in the United Kingdom and Germany.
Enterprises like Nissan alliance, hotels, as well as public sector customers such as the United Kingdom Ministry of Defense, the islands, health services executive are choosing brand tends to transform their organizations while meeting European data sovereignty security and compliance needs. Security and compliance remain paramount for enterprise customers. Azure is already the most trusted most compliant cloud with 49 certifications, more than any other cloud provider and our US government cloud has the highest number of certifications and dedicated data center regions in the industry to meet the stringent requirements of our public sector customers.
We are applying AIT security with the new Azure security Center which leverages advanced analytics and machine learning to detect threats and help enterprise customers respond with comprehensive cyber security and management.
Looking beyond infrastructure services, across industries customers like trucks North America, and are using Azure intelligence services to build powerful new offerings for their customers. More than half of the fortune 500 have our enterprise mobility services up more than 20 points year-over-year. This quarter we released a premium version of our enterprise mobility service that includes advanced security management for SaaS applications, automatic document classification and encryption, advanced identity protection, and we crossed three quarters of 1 billion unique user identities in Azure active directory.
This quarter we announced a number of key partnerships. Adobe and as a be recognized Azure's leadership in the cloud on bringing their industry leading marketing and human resource solutions to our platform, giving our mutual customers powerful new ways to transform their business. Customers and developers are also choosing Azure for its openness. Enabling digital transformation for everyone means supporting the widest range of platform frameworks and tools.
This quarter we announced that we are open source Windows power shall, our industry-leading infrastructure management tool and made it available on Linux. We continue to see strong interest in the previous post SQL Server with 19,000 customers registered including more than half of the fortune 500. It's opening conversations with customers spanning their entire data state both on premise and in the cloud. Azure fabric on Linux enables to high skill microservices and cloud applications. And we announced that our new power platform in Azure capable of extra scale compute will support Café, torch and our own frameworks for deep learning. 
Finally, we're building our server products to become the edge of our cloud to support true hybrid computing. The new Windows server 2015 gives IT professionals new layers of security and brings Azure inspired innovation for infrastructure and cloud applications. And we expanded our partnership with doctor to make the commercially supported Docker engine available to Windows 2016 customers at no additional cost.
Now let's talk about more computing were very also seeing intelligence transform Windows 10 and our ecosystem of devices. We now have more than 400 million monthly active devices on Windows 10 and nearly 200,000,000,000 hours of usage. And we are expanding our growth opportunities for Windows with enterprises and an area such as gaming.
Last quarter I outlined three aspects of our Windows strategy. First deliver more value and innovation, particularly for enterprise customers. Second, grow new monetization through services across the unified Windows platform. Third, innovate in new device categories in partnership with our OEMs. Let me talk to the progress we're making in each. This quarter we release Windows 10 anniversary update with advanced security features including Windows defender, threat protection, our cloud enabled service that helps enterprise detect, investigate and respond to advance networking tax. And with threat intelligence sharing capabilities we enable IT to investigate and respond to security threats across Windows 10 and Office 365. Our advancements in security helped to drive by three times at present Windows enterprise deployments over the last six months.
The growth and customer option is also driving increased developers search and Cortana engagement. The number of developers building and updating universal Windows apps is up three times year-over-year, more than 1000 application of been developed using the Cortana API and Windows 10 Cortana search box now has 141 million monthly active users with almost 13,000,000,000 questions asked to date.
Gaming is a leading driver of engagement on Windows 10 and opens up new experience it and scenarios across Windows devices. For the past three consecutive months Xbox one has been the number one selling console in the United States, giving a strong momentum heading into the holiday season. Our highly engage Xbox live database continues to grow across Windows 10 IOS and android up 21% year-over-year, and we have more than 20 billion hours of gameplay on Windows 10 PCs and tablets, more than 500% increase year-over-year.
Our commitment to grow Xbox live community led us to acquire beam this quarter, and innovative and interactive live streaming service that gives viewers the ability to watch and play along with their favorite game in real time. Finally, let's talk about her progress in new device categories. Surface continues to drive category growth and more commercial customers are choosing to deploy service with the deals of 500 devices or more increasing 70% year-over-year and we are reaching more commercial customers of all sizes with the support of our channel partners.
The Windows holographic platform and Microsoft Hololens are opening up new differentiated opportunities on Windows. This quarter we made Microsoft Hololens development edition available to all developers and business customers in the US and Canada and last week we expanded our presence to six additional markets. Enterprise customers like Volvo, Japan Airlines and the PGA tour, all embracing Microsoft Hololens to transform the way they work and create new mixed reality experiences for customers.
It's still early, but it's great to see the innovation and creativity that developers are bringing to the platform and coming in 2017 we will enable our hardware partners to deliver entirely new mixed reality experiences with Windows holographic and on Windows 10. In closing, we are leading digital transformation across all industries and geographies. Creating enormous opportunity for Microsoft and our partners. As we infuse AI into all of our computing platforms and experiences, we will drive even greater transformational value for our customers. In the coming weeks, I'm looking forward to sharing news about our new innovation in Windows 10 and Office 365.
Now let me hand it over to Amy to walk through this quarter's results in more detail and share our outlook and I look forward to rejoining you after for questions.
Amy Hood
Thank you, Satya and good afternoon everyone. This quarter revenue was $22.3 billion up 3% and 5% in constant currency. Gross margin was flat and up 2% in constant currency. Operating income was flat and grew 4% in constant currency and earnings per share was $0.76, increasing 9% or 13% in constant currency.
I'm pleased with the strong execution was on the first quarter from our sales teams and the partner ecosystem. Across both our commercial and consumer businesses. Across most markets our results were in line with microeconomic trends. With strength in key markets like the US, Western Europe and Japan. Momentum and cloud services contributed to a total commercial annuity mix of 88%, up two points from the prior year.
We again saw higher than expected transactional deal volume, primarily driven by office commercial products and our small and midsize business segment. This quarter the dollar volume of annuity expirations was significantly larger than the prior year, and was solid renewals from that base, we grew our commercial bookings by 18%.
The larger base also drove our contracted not billed balance to more than 25 The larger base also drove our contracted not billed balance to more than $25.5 billion. Strong execution resulted in better than expected commercial revenue of $22.3 million or an 8% increase in constant currency. Our commercial cloud revenue run rate exceeded $13 billion this quarter, growing 59%.
As I assure previously, we expect our commercial cloud gross margin percentage to materially improve throughout the year. This quarter our commercial cloud gross margin percentage was 49%, up seven points sequentially, although we do expect variability from quarter to quarter. Importantly, gross margin dollars grew by 61% across the total commercial cloud. 
Now the company gross margin. Our company gross margin was approximately 65%, down a little less than two points from the prior year, impacted by an increasing mix of commercial cloud revenue, slightly offset by improvements in more personal computing. The revenue performance in more personal computing largely drove COGS above our expectations. This quarter the FX impact on total and segment level revenue was in line with expectations. FX had a two point negative impact on productivity and business processes and Intelligent Cloud results, and a one point negative impact on more personal computing results.
Total operating expenses were flat and grew 1% in constant currency from investment supporting our commercial cloud. At the company level, operating income grew 4% in constant currency.
Let's turn to each segment where we can now discuss constant currency impacted the revenue and operating income levels. This quarter our productivity and business processes segment delivered results above our expectations with approximately $6.7 billion in revenue, an increase of 6% and 8% in constant currency. In office commercial revenue increased by 5% and 8% in constant currency as Office 365 growth continued to outpace the shift from our on premise business. We again grew our install base across all the workloads.
In our Office 365 commercial business are premium workload mix was above 60%. As mentioned earlier, our transactional results were higher than expected in the small and mid-size customer and segment and benefited from a stabilizing commercial PC market. Office consumer revenue grew 8% also a percent in constant currency benefited from a stronger than expected consumer PC market. Subscriber fee growth and recurring subscription revenue and our dynamics business grew 11% up 13% in constant currency as customer preference for cloud services and CRM online and dynamic the X the timber the two billings and seat growth.
Segment gross margin dollars were flat up 2% in constant currency. Segment gross margin percentage declined on an increase in cloud revenue mix. Operating expenses grew 2%, also 2% in constant currency primarily driven by investments in cloud engineering. Operating income declined slightly but was up 2% in constant currency. Intelligent Cloud segment delivered nearly $6.4 billion in revenue above our expectations and grew 10% or 10% in constant currency. Server products and cloud services grew 11% and 13% in constant currency. Demand for our hybrid cloud offerings led to another quarter of double digit annuity revenue growth within server products and cloud services, partially offset by a decline in our transactional on premise server business. Server premium products grew double digits in constant currency.
As expected, enterprise services revenue growth slowed this 12.45% and 2% in constant currency, largely due to a decrease in volume of support agreements associated with Windows server 2003 and support. Gross margin dollars grew 2% and 4% in constant currency and segment gross margin percentage declined primarily due to increase in cloud revenue mix, partially offset by significant improvement in Azure gross margin. Given the growth opportunity in cloud, we increased our operating expenses by 21%, also 21% in constant currency to fund cloud engineering, sales capacity and developer engagement. Consequently, operating income declined 14% and 11% in constant currency. 
Now to our final segment, more personal computing. Revenue was $9.3 billion, down 2% and 1% in constant currency and better than expected across multiple businesses. First, our OEM results. Our total OEM business was flat this quarter were in line with the PC market and better than we expected. OEM Pro revenue grew 1%, reflecting the stabilizing commercial PC market, particularly in the US. OEM non-Pro revenue declined by 1%, slightly ahead of the consumer PC market driven by a higher mix of premium devices. Channel inventory levels for OEM Pro and non-Pro remained at normal levels.
We're seeing strong growth in Windows 10 deployments. The annuity portion of our Windows commercial business grew again in constant currency as customers continue to commit to our differentiated security and management solutions. 
Overall, our total Windows commercial business revenue across small and mid-size businesses enterprises and academic institutions was flat and grew 2% year-over-year in constant currency. Patent licensing revenue increased this quarter, primarily due to favorable results in our annual contractual agreements. Our search business grew again this quarter driven by rate and volume improvements in being. The our growth rate is moderated we continue to gain share and scale while delivering profit. As expected, devices revenue declined this quarter. Revenue decreased 27% down 25% in constant currency due to a revenue declined 72% to 71% in constant currency.
Surface revenue increased 38% 39% in constant currency driven by year-over-year growth for surface Pro and bulk which launched in Q2 of the prior year. In gaming revenue decline 5% or 4% in constant currency, due to lower console hardware revenue. We continue to see strong engagement on our platform with monthly active Xbox live users up 21%. Our software and services revenue from console, PC in other gaming devices grew 6% or 8% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars.1% up 1% in constant currency as decreases due to Xbox consoles and phone were partially offset by our search and surface results. Segment gross margin percentage improved slightly given the revenue shift to higher margin products and services.
Operating expenses decreased 13% also 13% in constant currency primarily based on reduced phone spend and lower marketing spend resulting in segment operating income growth of 26% and 31% in constant currency. 
Now back to our company results. We invested $2.3 billion in capital expenditures, a decline from Q4 but consistent with our plan for investment to support customer and partner demand for our commercial and consumer cloud services. During the quarter we continued to rebalance our investment portfolio which resulted in other income and expense of $100 million from net recognized gains on investments in income from dividends and interest partially offset by interest expense. Our Non-GAAP effective tax rate was 70% this quarter. As I mentioned before, our income tax rate is impacted by three sectors. The proportion of service revenue versus licensing revenue, the geographic mix of revenue, and the timing of equity and our first quarter equity best impact of the REIT more significantly been in other quarters.
We returned $6.6 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends. We also raised our quarterly dividend by 8% to $.39. With that overview of the quarter, let's turn to the outlook. My commentary for the upcoming quarter does not include LinkedIn. We still expect the transaction to close in the second quarter.
Turning to FX, we expect one point of revenue impact of both the total company and individual segment levels. We expect our commercial business to remain healthy, but we will still see and experience variability our transactional business. We were also see strong annuity growth driven by solid renewal execution and increasing customer adoption and use of our cloud services. Therefore, we expect commercial revenue to be within the region $21.05 billion to $21.25 billion.
Next on CapEx, we will continue to invest to meet growing demand and see quarterly variability in spend. We expect the sequential dollar increase in the upcoming quarter. For the full year our total expected CapEx growth rate should be lower than FY '16 event efficiency improvements.
Now let me share some additional thoughts for each segment. In productivity and business processes we expect revenue of $6.9 billion to $7.1 billion. We expect the ongoing transition to the cloud to drive install base growth with continuing declines in our transactional business.
For the Intelligent Cloud segment, we expect revenue of 6.5 5 billion For the Intelligent Cloud segment, we expect revenue of $6.55 billion to $6.75 million driven by strong annuity growth across our server products and cloud services. We anticipate the enterprise services revenue will decline due to lower volumes of Windows server 2003 service agreement.
We expect more personal computing revenue to be $11.2 billion to $11.6 billion. This segment is impacted by different trends in our other two segments so some additional detail.
First on Windows. We expect our OEM business and the underlying PC market to be closely aligned. As a reminder, our OEM Pro business we exited Q2 last year with a slightly higher level of inventory. We currently see normal inventory levels in the channel which will dampen year-over-year growth of it. In search we expect things revenue growth to be similar to Q1. Additionally, we expect that total search revenue growth will slow considerably as we pass the one year anniversary of our young to deal and the associated change in revenue recognition. Phone revenue will continue to decline and as we previously announced, we anticipate closing the sale of our feature phone business in Q2. We expect surface revenue to decline as we anniversary the product launch from a year ago.
And in gaming we expect strong share performance in key markets like the US and the UK this holiday, but overall revenue will decline given lower price points and lower overall console units as mix shift towards Xbox One and Xbox One S. We expect continued active engagement growth on our gaming platform given the holiday season.
We expect COGS to be $9.7 billion to $9.9 billion with variability driven by device sales. We expect operating expenses between $7.85 billion and $7.95 billion in Q2, and we remain on path for full year operating expense of $31.1 billion to $31.4 billion. We expect other income and expenses to be $150 million as we continue to balance games on equity investments and income from interest and dividends against the interest expense in the net cost of hedging. We continue to expect our full year tax rate to be 20% plus or minus two points with variability due to three factors discussed earlier.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Chris for Q&A.
Chris Suh
Thanks Amy. We will now move to Q&A. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Certainly. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please proceed.
Brent Thill
Satya on Azure the numbers were really impressive given how hard the comp was, I'm curious if you could just help out a little more color in terms of what you saw during the quarter and maybe how some of the ticket sizes or sizes these are signs changing from the past year ? Thank you.
Satya Nadella
Overall, again I go back to how we think about Azure. We really have a view of distributed computing which is more expansive doing just even our HyperScale cloud. We think about Azure and our servers as one distributed computing fabric that’s building. We also don't think of Office 365 and Dynamics 365 as independent, we think of them altogether building out our commercial cloud because it takes one of the bigger growth areas we have in Azure, it's IoT but it's not just people connecting sensors and collecting data. They collect the data, they store the data, the analyze and do predictions on it but then after you do predictions you got to do something about the predictions. So in many cases they choose to use especially with the new Dynamics 365 field service module automating field service.
So it's those higher level scenarios that we are seeing in addition to the core infrastructure that supports hybrid that I think is accelerating and that's something that obviously we didn't make the decision last quarter to do that. This is a decision we made many, many years ago in some sense inception of Azure was built for a future which is much more distributed computing done in a very different way than the client server area. I think we're just finally getting into the early innings of what is true hybrid computing and it's good to sort of see those in last quarter's results as well.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. 
Keith Weiss
I want to drill in on Office 365 a little bit, 40% growth in commercial space is a really nice number but even nicer number on the revenue line I think 54% of constant currency growth in Office 365 commercial, that seems to imply you guys are seeing some nice ASP increase as the platform matures. Can you talk to us about where we are in that cycle of moving from a E1 to E3, is the E5 part of the equation yet? Are you guys actually moving there yet?
Amy Hood
When I talk about the premium services mix, in our Office Commercial 365 business being about 60%, that is what's driving whether that's the mix shift to E3 or ultimately to E5 you will continue to see and have headroom in that number but you are right, we are encouraged by the ARPU growth and the value proposition that has customers choosing the premium SKUs and continuing to choose those premium SKUs over time.
I don't really think about there being sort of a cap on that when you think about the mix percentage because part of it is as you know not just adding the first few in notes in E3 is continuing to add E5 and new scenarios over time that will continue to create. So hopefully that's helpful but you are right, it is ARPU driven the performance outside of the 40% growth.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. 
Heather Bellini
Satya I know that Brent asked you about Azure but I'm just wondering if you could share with us you mentioned that compute usage on Azure I think you said more than doubled or nearly doubled something to that effect. I'm just wondering if you could share with us kind of how you see coming pass [ph] coming along and where do you think we are in getting kind of the easier workloads to the cloud and are you now starting to see the inflection given we did see an inflection in growth on a year-over-year basis this quarter where you are starting to see production significant production workloads that are on premise actually starting to move over as well?
Satya Nadella
We definitely are seeing production workloads that are moving over from on premise, but I think the more interesting thing Heather for us is to see new workloads. When I look at what's happening with say some of the most innovative work we've done around distributed computing which is service fabric and how people are in fact going straight to building out using our past services some of the new HyperScale cloud services using microservices and not only are they doing that but we're also seeing great growth in our serverless infrastructure which is Azure functions.
So I am actually as excited about new cloud growth from new cloud workloads from the same customers so the much interesting thing that I am observing is that it could be the same model customer that was participating with us in the client server area. We are not just building or moving their IT but they are building new digital services for HyperScale and that's what it is probably unique in terms of what is changed year-over-year for us. It's not just the Silicon Valley startups anymore, it is the core enterprise that is also becoming a digital company and we are well positioned to serve them and that's good to see.

Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Karl Keirstead
Question for Amy. The operating cash flow generation $11.6 billion was extraordinary. I don't think you've had a 50% plus cash flow margin since early 2012. Is this a little bit of an anomaly may be driven by unearned revenues or is something changing in the business model that might change the rate of cash flow generation in coming quarters as well? Thank you.
Amy Hood
It is actually impacted by the same thing that impacted free cash flow this quarter, which is about a $1.3 billion on settled cash settlement impact. So you actually see that revert in Q2, although our free cash flow growth of 8% in the quarter was actually very good, and I do feel good about that, but I want to make sure you don't miss understand the root cause that makes the number a bit of an anomaly.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein. Please proceed.
Mark Moerdler
So want to drill in a little more. The margin for commercial cloud improved 7% which given the size is a large improvement. Can you give us some more details on what exactly is driving that margin improvement. You said it's going to be improving over the year, but how sustainable is that drive to improvement?
Satya Nadella
Let me start market and then Amy you can add to it. Again Mark this goes back to a little bit of understanding I guess how we think about both X as well as OpEx in terms of our cloud. The architectural design we have for example when we do X we are buying the four everything that Microsoft does which is everything from Azure to Office 3652 Dynamics 365 as well as our consumer services like Xbox live. And you see the growth that we talked about across all of this. Then we have a very common platform both for first party workloads as well as our third party business.
And so then as we drive efficiency and our cloud infrastructure, when we for example use to be more out of our network, that's efficiency that we gain across the marginal cost and gross margin that spans everything that we do. Then also what we think about as the mix our goal is not just to sell commodity services, but to actually use commodity services in some cases as a bootstrap for higher level services because of things like data gravity. So there will be differences quarter to quarter. We may impact on board a few customers who first on board a lot of storage at commodity service levels, and then later on start some of the high level services.
So the margin improvement on a lot over a period of time is something that we are absolutely going to see, but from quarter to quarter there will be more volatility, but I would ask our investor base to think more about the architecture as well as the financial outlays of what we're building. We're not just building Azure we're building from 13 Office 365 Dynamics 365 as well as our consumer services withdrawal cloud oriented and it's a combination of that that's driving margin, but Amy I will let you add there.
Amy Hood
But I would say in terms of sustainability are quarter to quarter, Satya is right. There is going to be very ability the variability is really two things. One is the case of the mix shift to Azure as it grows at the pace we're seeing it does impact quarter to quarter. The overall commercial cloud revenue mix, but I would also say the directionality of the Azure gross margin for example which recent significantly improved we expect to continue. Certainly over the course of this year as we have discussed. So I think the directionality of sustainability is correct and I think the variability can certainly occur from any of the reasons Satya talked about.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed.
Walter Pritchard
I think Amy am wondering on the segment operating margins guided those per se, but you have sort of flat performance in operating income in an declines in IC with growth in do you expect to see as you get towards the end of the year that the enterprise cloud segments move positive and MPC is not as much of a driver how should we think about the evolution of the product contributions of the over the year?
Amy Hood
Sure. I am actually going to cover in commercial segments as one because really when you think about the commercial cloud, it's really about capturing the opportunity of selling more complete solutions which include dynamics and office plus some components of Azure which is I think really the trend you'll see us talk about from here on out. So what I would say is, he will continue to see us focus on gross margin improvement and we talked about that.
You also continue to see us invest where we see massive market addressable expansion with sales capacity as well. So I think we have pivoted dollars to invest in that opportunity. He will continue to see us do that. But we also expect revenue growth in gross margin growth to come out of that investment. So I do believe that's a continued pace you will see us on, and we feel good about the ROI of the investments we have made especially in those commercial segments.
In MPC, I generally expect he will continue to see improvement through the year just based on the mix of products that we will have over the course of the year, that's not new. Use all the same mechanism last year through the year. As we pivot from our phone business to some of our higher margin product. And so, I suspect you will see a similar pattern on a similar desire by Satya to continue to invest toward growth especially on the commercial side.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Mark Murphy 
So Amy, you are reporting an impressive buildup of the long term deferred revenue itself 162% year-over-year. At the same time, some of your partners feel that you are gradually doing away with a three year that have existed for so long at that you are replacing them with the vehicle which is a little more flexible in terms of length of contract in there could be some shorter lengths. Could you help us in terms of how to think through the long term deferred revenue buildup as you do start to mix over to the MPSA?
Amy Hood
Let me break report that long term earned balance a bit. I do really focused and I think it's important if you're trying to understand the buildup of our commercial business to focus only on the unearned commercial balance. Our overall long term under imbalance has been impacted by the Windows 10 deferral over the past.
And so it can make a bit of a distraction towards seen the underlying trends. That being said, our commercial under balance is seeing good growth I'm proud of our performance this quarter. Both sequentially and year-over-year.
If you think about any change we're making or not, in our partner agreements our customer agreements. We still do generally rely the vast majority on three year agreements so whether or not the term were to change, given how we recognize revenue, I will you know if it's going to be material and I do not expect the change are talking about to be material in any way on the commercial unearned balance.

Raimo Lenschow
Quick question more on an industry theme for Satya. We obviously saw a very interesting answer from AWS and [indiscernible] which kind of seems to suggest a hybrid cloud is the way forward [indiscernible] has to react. Can you talk a little bit about your customer feedback around the hybrid cloud offering from you and how your customer is thinking about that working with you together? Thank you.
Satya Nadella
I spoke to this a little earlier because from day one we have this vision of how we want to build for the future distributed computing would include our hyper scale cloud service which is Azure an impact Azure is built on Hyper-V and we always said that we were going to build our server as the edge of our hyper scale cloud and so that's what Windows Server 2016 represents, that’s what SQL Server 2016 represents and so we have this unique capabilities like be able to stretch even a single table in a database in SQL 2016 all the way to the cloud for having infinite table capacity and then having your apps and queries work.
How we're doing containers for example in Windows Server 2016 we have great container support as well as support for things like our service fabric so that people can have absolute application portability and in fact people can even [indiscernible] applications.
We have many customers who tier their storage and compute across a hybrid backplane. So this is an architectural design point that we have built from the ground up from day one and it's good to see people validating it now and elsewhere and we will take that as a validation of something that we thought of a long time ago.

Our next question comes from the line of [indiscernible]. Please proceed. 
Unidentified Analyst
Can you just compare and contrast AWS versus Azure versus AWS for me standpoint of the technology footprint that you are offering both these companies? And Amy if you could just comment on the margin structure of your business trip of the business relative to AWS and if you have time talk about the Windows 10 cycle. Why hasn't got to be the best Windows 10 cycle for the enterprise compared to the previous cycle thank you so much.
Satya Nadella
I would say I talked about sort of the reasons the three big reasons why customers choose our cloud in our cloud infrastructure in particular. One, it is about the hybrid design point that is at the core of how we are billed, both Azure as well as our servers. It is because of the higher level services that we have. It is also because of the design point we have around not just Azure but as well as Dynamics 365 and Office 365 and the extensibility of our cloud services across all three of them, and that's really the fundamental reasons why customers choose us. The other thing I will mention is, we have more of a commitment I would say which is been there from a long time to build out a global footprint with more regions and anyone.
We are more certifications than anyone in terms of adhering to both regulated industry as well as digital sovereignty. We've done many things we're the only cloud provider for example that operates in China. We operate in Germany under German law.
And that matters to multinational companies but also are trying to operate across many geographies and jurisdictions. So those are our core attributes that are driving our growth and will continue to stay focused on them.
Amy Hood
In terms of the gross margin question, I feel very good talk about this quarter about our improvement year-over-year and remain confident that we are heading in the right direction and so, I think when you think about that plus the rest of our offerings, I think we're pretty confident.
I will take the opportunity and asked about Windows 10 in the enterprise market that we are encouraged by the pace of deployment, the number of proof of concepts, and actually some of the stability we've seen in the commercial PC market in terms of starting to see some so I think overall I think we will continue to watch, but our security and management value prop I think really is paying off.

Our next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. 
Ross MacMillan
Satya, I actually had a question for you on SQL server as you think about the port to Linux, what if you can provide an update on two things, one, it's just the timing of when we should see that in market and then two, are there other things you need to do to meet that requirement across the landscape.
So for example, you have to think about supporting Java runtimes inside of SQL server moving a little bit away from the traditional that development of armed.
Just curious as to how your Dick about getting your arms around a wider set of use cases on alternative operating systems. Thanks.
Satya Nadella
Overall, we are very, very excited about what we are seeing with SQL on Linux because the entire idea was to be able to have a full conversation around the data as stated with customers. And to now be able to talk about the full SQL estate one of the other conversations that we are having is not just about SQL but our analytics and advanced analytics with where we've done some very, very compelling work again across Linux and Windows and then of course the cloud.
So it's really the combination of SQL advanced analytics and the cloud with things like Azure datalink that are really the choices customers are trying to make as they think about their digital capability and the next generation of services and policy storage and processing capability they need.
Now, in terms of having support for these different runtimes, you're absolutely right, that's the reason why for example on Azure itself Java is first class. We have Linux is first class. We have real openness to all of the frameworks that you can call out to, and that something that we stay very attuned to come out which is we are not trying to fight some old battles.
This is all about being able to serve customers on their needs today and that's what is leading and driving a lot of our choices as well as how we think about our market opportunity.

Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen. Please proceed.
Gregg Moskowitz
Satya your make a much bigger bet on AI and rightfully so and you highlighted some very interesting use cases having said that, Microsoft has worked on AI project for quite some time. So can you help us understand what degree of positive change you think will come from the combined group 8 you have recently formed including when you think material AI benefits will become truly ingrained in the customer's workflows and then secondly how should we think about the incremental investment in AI going forward?
Satya Nadella
Overall, I am thrilled about both the AI group that we have formed, the AI research and the heritage we have with them even this week I think we publicly are talking about setting the state-of-the-art when it comes to something like speech recognition and something that we did even with image net an image recognition and object.
So these are capabilities that are not easy to build if you don't have a real commitment to research and then the ability to take that research and then ultimately turn into products.
So the way to measure from the investment side is to see AI when it is infused into everything we do. Take Hololens, the ability of Hololens to be able to see the world, reconstructed and in that world to be able to superimpose holograms, that is AI applied AI that is working today.
When you have Skype translate when two people are talking two different languages and are able to automatically translate without between languages, it's using a deep neural net pens bring together speech synthesis, speech recognition and machine translation with Skype data, that is fairly magical.
When you seeing capable of running flow to create intelligence, that is what we are using impact from our speech and vision work. That is AI as applied today. So I am not waiting for some future date to see ROI from AI, we're very much going forward even the office tools example I used. They're all using AI today.
The PowerPoint designer if you want the most practical use of it, even identify great PowerPoint slides now because of AI. And so, that's how I measure progress.
We are committed to long-term research, but we're also very focused on having the long term research translated into everyday use products, and that's what you will see from us going forward.

Our last question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel. Please proceed. 
Brad Reback
Amy quick question with the recent release of WinServer 16, is there any reason to think that we shouldn't see some uptick in the transactional business, especially with easing comps in the next couple of quarters? Thanks.
Amy Hood
With our annuity mix as high as it is, it can impact at a couple points either way, but I don't think about that as really immaterial impact. You should think about in the next couple of quarters. And our focus will always be making sure we have a clear roadmap for customers to make long-term commitments through annuity and so we are really trying to get away from some of that launch impact that you may normally expect to see.

Greetings and welcome to Microsoft's fourth quarter fiscal year 2016 earnings call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Chris Suh, General Manager, Investor Relations. Thank you, you may begin.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me today are: Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. On our website, microsoft.com/investor, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provide the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.
Unless otherwise specified, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's fourth quarter performance in addition to the impact of these items and events had on financial results.
Additionally, any mention of operating expense refers to segment operating expenses as defined in the footnotes of our Form 10-Q, which includes research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative, but excludes the impact of integration and restructuring charges. As a reminder, in May we announced plans to further streamline the phone hardware business. During the fourth quarter, restructuring and related impairment expenses were $1.1 billion.
All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying business has performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. At the segment level, we provide constant currency growth for both revenue and gross margin. However, due to recent changes to our segment reporting groupings, we are not able to provide segment-level constant currency operating expense growth and consequently cannot derive constant currency segment operating income either. We do provide constant currency operating expense and operating income growth at the companywide level.
We'll post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website until July 19, 2017.
During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Thank you, Chris, and to everyone on the phone for joining. I want to thank all the Microsoft team members and partners who contributed to a successful year. We are proud of what we achieved and particularly how we are positioned for new growth. Today, Amy and I will share our fourth quarter results and our perspective on the year ahead.
We delivered $22.6 billion in revenue this quarter, an increase of 5% for the quarter in constant currency. This past year was a pivotal one in both our transformation and in our partnerships with customers who are also driving their own digital transformation. Our progress is best captured in the results of our three ambitions, starting with Productivity and Business Process. In a world of infinite information but finite attention and time, we aim to change the nature of work with digital technology. In pursuit of this ambition, we continue to add value to our products, grow usage, and increase our addressable market. Along these lines, let me start with Office 365 and then move to Dynamics 365.
In the last quarter, we advanced our collaboration tools. We launched Microsoft Planner, which helps teams manage operations, as well as Skype Meetings, which is aimed at helping small businesses collaborate. In June, we further strengthened our security value proposition with the release of Advanced Security Management.
Lastly, we continue to add intelligence in machine learning to Office to help people automate their tasks and glean insights from data. These advancements helped to drive increased usage across enterprises, small and medium businesses, and consumers. In the enterprise, Office 365 Commercial seats grew 45% year over year, and revenue grew 59% in constant currency. Also 70% of our Office Enterprise agreement renewals are in the cloud. Innovative companies like Facebook, Hershey's, Discovery Communications, Cushman Wakefield all adopted Office 365 and now see how transformative this service can be for their own business.
We are enthusiastic about the early feedback and growth opportunity from companies using our newly released Office 365 E5, which includes powerful security controls, advanced analytics, and cloud voice. These customers tell us that they love the simplification that comes with standardizing across all of our productivity workloads.
We see momentum in small and medium businesses, with a growing number of partners selling Office 365, now up to nearly 90,000, a 25% increase year over year. We continue to grab share and adding over 50,000 customers each month for 28 consecutive months.
We also see momentum amongst consumers, with now more than 23 million Office 365 subscribers. Across segments, customers increasingly experience the power of Office on their iOS and Android mobile devices. In fact, we now have more than 50 million iOS and Android monthly active devices, up more than four times over last year.
Now let's talk about progress with the other pillar of this ambition, Dynamics 365. We are removing any impedance that exists between productivity, collaboration, and business process. This month we took a major step forward with the introduction of Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Microsoft AppSource. Dynamics 365 provides business users with purpose-built SaaS applications. These applications have intelligence built in. They integrate deeply with communications and collaboration capabilities of Office 365.
Dynamics 365 along with AppSource and our rich application platform introduces a disruptive and customer-centric business model so customers can build what they want and use just the capabilities they need. The launch of Dynamics 365 builds on the momentum we're already seeing in this business. Customers around the globe are harnessing the power of Dynamics in their own transformation, including 24 Hour Fitness and AccuWeather. Overall, Dynamics now has nearly 10 million monthly paid seats, up more than 20% year over year, and Q4 billings grew more than 20% year over year.
Overall, Business Processes represent an enormous addressable market, projected to be more than $100 billion by 2020. It's a market we are increasingly focused on, and I believe we are poised with both Dynamics 365 and Microsoft AppSource to grow and drive opportunity for our partners.
Across Office 365 and Dynamics 365, developers increasingly see the opportunity to build innovative apps and experiences with the Microsoft Graph, and we now have over 27,000 apps connected to it. Microsoft AppSource will be a new way for developers to offer their services and reach customers worldwide.
Lastly, with Office 365 and Dynamics 365, we have the opportunity to connect the world's professional cloud and the world's professional network with our pending LinkedIn deal. Overall, the Microsoft Cloud is winning significant customer support. With more than $12 billion in Commercial Cloud annualized revenue run rate, we are on track to achieve our goal of $20 billion in fiscal year 2018. Also, nearly 60% of the Fortune 500 companies have at least three of our cloud offerings. And we continue to grow our annuity mix of our business. In fact, commercial annuity mix increased year over year to 83%.
Now let's get into the specifics of the Intelligent Cloud, an area of massive opportunity, as we are clearly one of the two enterprise cloud leaders. Companies looking to digitally transform need a trusted cloud partner and turn to Microsoft. As a result, Azure revenue and usage again grew by more than 100% this quarter. We see customers choose Microsoft for three reasons. They want a cloud provider that offers solutions that reflect the realities of today's world and their enterprise-grade needs. They want higher level services to drive digital transformation, and they want a cloud open to developers of all types. Let me expand on each.
To start, a wide variety of customers turn to Azure because of their specific real-world needs. Multinationals choose us because we are the only hybrid and hyperscale cloud spanning multiple jurisdictions. We cover more countries and regions than any other cloud provider, from North America to Asia to Europe to Latin America. Our cloud respects data sovereignty and makes it possible for an enterprise application to work across these regions and jurisdictions. More than 80% of the world's largest banks are Azure customers because of our leadership support for regulatory requirements, advanced security, and commitment to privacy. Large ISVs like SAP and Citrix as well as startups like Sprinklr also choose Azure because of our global reach and a broad set of platform services. Last week GE announced it will adopt our cloud for its IoT approach.
Next, Azure customers also value our unique higher-level services. Now at 33,000, we nearly doubled in one year the number of companies worldwide that have selected our Enterprise Mobility Solutions. The Dow Chemical Company leverages EMS along with Azure, Office 365, and Dynamics to give its thousands of employees secure real-time access to data and apps from anywhere.
Just yesterday, we announced Boeing will use Azure, our IoT suite, and Cortana Intelligence to drive digital transformation in commercial aviation, with connected airline systems optimization, predictive maintenance, and much more. This builds on great momentum in IoT, including our work with Rolls-Royce, Schneider Electric, and others.
This is great progress, but our ambitions are set even higher. Our Intelligent Cloud also enables cognitive services. Cortana Intelligence Suite offers machine learning capabilities and advanced predictive analytics. Customers like Jabil Circuit, Fruit of the Loom, Land O'Lakes, LIBER already realize the benefits of these new capabilities.
Lastly, central to our Intelligent Cloud ambition is providing developers with the tools and capabilities they need to build apps and services for the platforms and devices of their choice. The new Azure Container service as well as .NET Core 1.0 for open source and our ongoing work with companies such as Red Hat, Docker, and Mesosphere reflects significant progress on this front. We continue to see traction from open source, with nearly a third of customer virtual machines on Azure running Linux.
On the server side, premium server revenue grew double digits in constant currency year over year. New SQL Server 2016 helps us expand into new markets with built-in advanced analytics and unparalleled performance. More than 15,000 customers, including over 50% of the Fortune 500, have registered for the private preview of SQL Server for Linux. And we're not slowing down. We will launch Windows Server 2016 and System Server 2016 later this year.
Now let's talk about the progress in More Personal Computing. We have increased Windows 10 monthly active devices and are now at more than 350 million. This is the fastest adoption rate of any prior Windows release. While we are proud of these results, given changes to our phone plan, we changed how we will assess progress. Going forward, we will track progress by regularly reporting the growth of Windows 10 monthly active devices in addition to progress on three aspects of our Windows strategy: first, deliver more value and innovation, particularly for enterprise customers; second, grow new monetization through services across our unified Windows platform; third, innovate in new device categories in partnership with our OEMs. Let me walk through each.
We continue to pursue our goal of moving people from needing Windows to choosing Windows to loving Windows. In two weeks, we will launch Windows 10 Anniversary Update, which takes a significant step forward in security. We are also extending Windows Hello to support apps and websites and delivering a range of new features like Windows Ink and updates to Microsoft Edge. We expect these advances will drive increased adoption of Windows 10, particularly in the enterprise, in the coming year. We already have strong traction, with over 96% of our enterprise customers piloting Windows 10.
Next, as we grow our install base and engagement, we generate more opportunity for Microsoft and our ecosystem. Bing profitability continues to grow, with greater than 40% of the search revenue in June from Windows 10 devices. Bing PC query share in the United States approached 22% this quarter, not including volume from AOL and Yahoo!. The Cortana search box has over 100 million monthly active users, with 8 billion questions asked to date.
We continue to drive growth in gaming by connecting fans on Xbox Live across Windows 10, iOS, and Android. Just this quarter we launched our Minecraft Realm subscription on Android and iOS. Overall engagement on Xbox Live is at record levels, with more than 49 million monthly active users, up 33% year over year. At E3 we announced our biggest lineup of exclusive games ever for Xbox One and Windows 10 PCs. And we announced Xbox Play Anywhere titles, where gamers can buy a game once and play it on both their Windows 10 PC and Xbox One. We also announced two new members of the Xbox One console family, the Xbox One S and Project Scorpio.
The Windows Store continues to grow, with new universal Windows apps like Bank of America, Roku, SiriusXM, Instagram, Facebook, Wine, Hulu, and popular PC games like Quantum Break.
Finally, we are innovating in new device categories in partnership with OEMs. Our hardware partners are embracing the new personal computing vision, with over 1,500 new devices designed to take advantage of Windows 10 innovations like Touch, Pen, Hello, and better performance and power efficiency.
Microsoft's family of Surface devices continues to drive category growth, and we are reaching more commercial customers of all sizes with the support of our channel partners. We recently announced new Surface enterprise initiatives with IBM and Booz Allen Hamilton to enable more customer segments. Also in the past year, we grew our commercial Surface partner channel from over 150 to over 10,000.
Lastly this quarter, more and more developers and enterprise customers got to experience two entirely new device categories from Microsoft Surface Hub and Microsoft HoloLens. While we are still in the early days of both of these devices, we are seeing great traction with both enterprise customers and developers, making us optimistic about future growth.
In closing, I want to reflect on the opportunity ahead of us. Simply put, businesses will not just use digital technologies, but they will become digital companies. This generates enormous opportunity for Microsoft and our partners. We are the ones who can empower digital transformation across all industries, companies, and geographies with our technology and platforms.
With that, I'll hand it over to Amy to go through this quarter's results in greater detail and share our outlook, and I look forward to rejoining you after that to answer questions
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $22.6 billion, up 2% and 5% in constant currency. Gross margin was flat but up 4% in constant currency. Operating income this quarter declined by 3% and grew 6% in constant currency. And earnings per share was $0.69, increasing 11% year over year or 27% in constant currency.
Across most markets, our execution and results were generally as expected, with some strength in the U.S. But we did see additional softness in Brazil, the Middle East, and Africa, which were impacted by macroeconomic headwinds.
From a seasonality perspective, the fourth quarter is always an important one for our Commercial business. Our results were strong, as our sales teams led with our cloud offers. Healthy renewals helped to drive double-digit annuity performance in constant currency. Our total annuity mix reached 83%, up one point year over year. While our Commercial Cloud continued to drive a higher annuity mix overall, we also had better than expected transactional revenue performance, as products like Office 2016 and SQL Server 2016 generated more deal volume.
The dollar volume of expiring enterprise agreements was smaller this quarter than last year. On that base, our commercial bookings increased 4% in constant currency, driven by customer preference for our cloud offers. Commercial unearned revenue slightly beat our expectations at $24.6 billion or 8% growth in constant currency. Our contracted-not-billed [CNB] balance exceeded $25.5 billion. As Satya called out earlier, our Commercial Cloud annualized revenue run rate exceeded $12.1 billion, growing more than 50% year over year. Additionally, more than 70% of customers who signed enterprise agreements this quarter attached cloud offerings. Our Commercial Cloud gross margin was 42%, declining year over year, driven by investments for cloud capacity, deployment, and support.
Now let's turn to company gross margin performance. We were above our COGS expectations due to approximately $200 million of inventory adjustments from the change in our phone hardware business. And as expected, our mix of cloud services revenue continued to increase, resulting in gross margin percentage declines in the Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud segments. Importantly, gross margin dollars expanded year over year in constant currency.
In Q4, the FX impact on total and segment-level revenue was in line with expectations. FX had a three-point negative impact on Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud results and a two-point negative impact on More Personal Computing results.
As we've noted in previous quarters, we're not able to provide constant currency impact at the segment level for operating expenses and therefore segment operating income. This quarter, total operating expenses grew 1% in constant currency, above our expectations due to legal settlements and revenue-driven sales cost. At the company level, our operating income grew 6% in constant currency, as FX had a nine-point impact on our results.
Now let's turn to each segment. This quarter, our Productivity and Business Processes segment delivered results above our expectations, with nearly $7 billion in revenue, an increase of 5% and 8% in constant currency. In Office Commercial, revenue increased by 5% and 9% in constant currency, as Office 365 growth outpaced the shift from our on-premises business.
Our seat growth was driven by broad-based momentum across commercial customers of all sizes. While we generally expect transactional purchasing to continue to decline, results across all products came in higher than anticipated this quarter. Office Consumer revenue increased 19% and 18% in constant currency, outperforming the consumer PC market, driven by seat growth, recurring subscription revenue, and six points of growth from Japan, which had a particularly weak quarter a year ago. And our Dynamics business grew 6%, up 7% in constant currency, with strong billings and seat growth.
Segment gross margin dollars were flat and up 4% in constant currency. The gross margin percentage declined on a higher cloud revenue mix within the segment coupled with an increase in cloud investments. Operating expenses grew 6% from investments in Commercial Cloud sales programs and engineering. As a result, operating income declined 5%.
The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered slightly more than $6.7 billion in revenue, growing 7% and 10% in constant currency. Demand and use of our hybrid cloud offerings led to another quarter of double-digit annuity revenue growth within server products and cloud services, partially offset by a decline in our Transactional on-premises server business.
Enterprise Services revenue grew 12%, 14% in constant currency, as customer demand for Windows Server 2003 and the support agreement and Premier Services continued this quarter. Gross margin dollars grew 1% and 5% in constant currency. And gross margin percentages declined as cloud mix accelerated. This quarter, operating income declined 17%, driven by investment in sales resources and engineering.
Now to our final segment, More Personal Computing; revenue was $8.9 billion, down 4% and 2% in constant currency. First, our OEM results; our total OEM business grew 11% this quarter, outperforming the overall PC market, which was better than we expected in most markets, including the U.S., the UK, and Germany, partially offset by incremental weakness in India and Russia. OEM non-Pro revenue increased 27%, and similar to last quarter, was driven by a higher mix of premium devices. OEM Pro revenue grew 2%, reflecting a stabilizing commercial PC market and a higher mix of business PCs sold with Windows Pro. Inventory across both OEM Pro and non-Pro remained at normal levels.
Windows volume licensing grew 3% and 9% in constant currency, with ongoing annuity growth. IP licensing declined, impacted by both a decrease in total unit volume and lower revenue per unit.
We continued to execute well in our search business this quarter. And as we committed, Bing was profitable for the full fiscal year, driven by increasing revenue per search and search volume. As expected, devices revenue significantly decreased this quarter. Revenue declined 35%, also 35% in constant currency due to phone, where revenue declined 70% in constant currency.
Surface revenue increased 9% in constant currency, as Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book growth was partially offset by unit declines in our prior-generation Surface 3. And in gaming, revenue declined 9% or 8% in constant currency, driven by lower Xbox 360 unit volume and reduced Xbox One pricing. Our overall gaming ecosystem showed healthy growth with 49 million monthly active Xbox Live users, or a 33% increase, and 4% Xbox Live revenue growth.
Segment gross margin dollars declined 3% or roughly flat in constant currency, as decreases due to Xbox consoles and the phone inventory adjustment were partially offset by our OEM and search results.
Operating expenses decreased this quarter by 13%, based primarily on reduced phone spend and the transition of display advertising sales to AOL, resulting in segment operating income growth of 59%.
Now back to our overall company results. We invested $3.1 billion in capital expenditures, consistent with our plan for accelerated investment, as we added both commercial and consumer global cloud capacity to meet near-term and longer-term customer demand. During the quarter, we continued to rebalance our investment portfolio, which resulted in other income and expense of $267 million from net recognized gains on investments, partially offset by interest expense.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 15% this quarter, lower than we expected. Our income tax expense reflected a favorable mix between U.S. and foreign countries as well as benefits associated with distributions from foreign affiliates. This quarter, we returned $6.4 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends.
Before turning to next quarter's outlook, I want to share our view on the shape of next fiscal year. My commentary both on the year and next quarter does not include LinkedIn. However, we still expect the transaction to close in the second quarter.
For the full year, we expect the FX impact to lessen throughout the year, assuming current rates remain stable. In H1, we expect a total impact of one point, reducing to zero in H2. The fundamentals of our Commercial business remain strong, and we anticipate that cloud services and healthy renewals will continue to drive high annuity mix.
As I've noted before, our commercial Transactional business is influenced by different dynamics. Most important, it's impacted by a structural transition to the cloud across all workloads. But it's also more sensitive to overall macroeconomic conditions and changes in corporate budgets. We expect volatility, as we saw in both Q3 and Q4 this year, to continue in the next fiscal year.
Before discussing our total company gross margin expectations, let me first address Commercial Cloud gross margin. We expect the Commercial Cloud gross margin percentage and dollars to materially improve next fiscal year. We have invested heavily to build share, expand geographically, and ensure world-class support and reliability for our commercial customers. Going forward, we expect those investments to provide benefits of scale. We also anticipate our cloud capital expenditure growth curve will slow. Given seasonality and revenue mix, Commercial Cloud gross margin will see variability quarter to quarter but an overall trend of material improvement. At the company level, as each cloud service continues to grow and improve its gross margin percentage, our company gross margin should only decline roughly a point in FY 2017.
We now expect our full-year operating expense will be $31.1 billion to $31.4 billion, as we continue to prioritize spend on strategic growth opportunities.
Lastly, our effective tax rate. Our tax rate is impacted by three factors: the proportion of services revenue versus licensing revenue; the geographic mix of revenue; and the timing of equity vests. As our cloud continues to gain momentum, we expect our tax rate to increase. With quarterly variability based on these factors, we anticipate our non-GAAP tax rate to be 20% for the full year plus or minus two points.
Now for the outlook for the next quarter. Based on current currency rates and forecasted geographic mix of revenue, we expect two points of negative impact on total revenue in Q1. By segment, the negative impact is two points in Productivity and Business Process, two points in Intelligent Cloud, and one point in More Personal Computing.
We expect Commercial unearned revenue to be within the range of $21.8 billion to $22 billion, in line with historic seasonality. In Productivity and Business Process, we expect revenue to be $6.4 billion to $6.6 billion. We will continue to grow our install base and drive premium mix through offers like Office 365 E5. We anticipate continued transactional declines as customer migration to the cloud accelerates.
In our Consumer business, we will outpace the consumer PC market, but the benefit from Japan's improved results over a weak prior period and the benefit from last year's Office 2016 launch are not expected to repeat.
For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $6.1 billion and $6.3 billion, driven by continued annuity strength across Azure and our hybrid cloud offerings, offset by ongoing declines in our transactional on-premises server business, and moderating growth from support agreements in Enterprise Services.
In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $8.7 billion and $9 billion. We anticipate that our OEM revenue will be more in line with overall PC market trends. Devices revenue will decline again from our actions in phone. Gaming revenue will be driven by the same factors as in Q4. And in search, we expect Bing's growth trajectory to continue. We expect COGS to be $7.5 billion to $7.6 billion, with variability due to device sales.
We expect operating expenses between $7.35 billion and $7.45 billion. We expect other income and expenses to be approximately zero, as realized gains on investments should offset debt expense.
And with that, Chris, let's go to Q&A.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Amy. We'll move now to the Q&A section. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Excellent, thank you, guys, for taking the question and a very nice quarter. I wanted to dig into Azure, maybe one question for Satya and one question for Amy. Satya, you mentioned the Boeing agreement. What was interesting about that is not just a large company moving significant workloads onto Azure. But from my reading, it sounds like there's a distribution side of this agreement that you guys are going to help them distribute some of those applications on a going-forward basis. I was wondering if you could touch a little bit on that. Is that a one-time thing, or is that something that you look to do more often with some of these large companies, moving workloads onto Azure?
And then for Amy, thank you for the additional detail on the cloud gross margin profile on a going-forward basis. When we dig into just Azure, you said in the past that you expect to match the gross margin profile of what we're seeing in Amazon Web Services. Does that commentary still hold? And maybe you can give us a mark-to-market on how you're doing in terms of matching up Azure's gross margin profile to what you're seeing from your top competitor there.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Keith, for those questions, so let me start on the first one. You're absolutely right that one of the phenomena now is that pretty much anyone who is a customer of Azure is also in some form an ISV, and that's no longer just limited to people who are ""in the classic tech industry"" or the software business. That's the same case with GE. It's the same case with Boeing. It's the same case with Schneider Electric or ABB or any one of the customers we are working with because they all are taking some of their assets and converting them into SaaS applications on Azure. And that's something that we will in fact have distribution agreements with.
And AppSource is a pretty major announcement for us because we essentially created for SaaS applications and infrastructure applications a way to distribute their applications through us and our channel. And I think it makes in fact our cloud more attractive to many of them because of that. So we look – I think going forward, you'll look to see – or you'll see us do much more of this with many other customers of ours.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And to your question on Azure gross margins specifically and how we think about that in comparison, let me first say the additional color I gave in terms of comments in terms of material improvement clearly also apply to our Azure portfolio as well. We're encouraged by the improvements we've seen year over year. And we do expect material improvement in FY 2017, both from the benefits of scale and the investments we've made, but importantly also in the revenue trajectory we're seeing and the makeup of that revenue. Boeing's agreement is one such agreement in terms of embedding a premium service at a premium gross margin. We signed many of those this quarter that we feel quite good about.
I think I have a strong line of sight to AWS's margin profile and still feel good about the progress we're making, not just on the workloads that are relevant, apples to apples with Azure, but also in our broader cloud portfolio and our ability to have very healthy margins across Dynamics 365 as well as Office 365 in conjunction with many of the innovations we're doing across Azure. So while I am focused on both the workload improvement, I'm also focused on what's possible across the entirety of the cloud. Thanks, Keith.
Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Excellent, thank you very much.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Keith. We'll go to the next question, please, operator.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thank you. So, Satya or Amy, last quarter the stock was hit in part on a deceleration in your on-premise server product business, and I think your commentary around the Transactional part of that suggested it softened a little bit. I think your tone on this call is a lot better around the Transactional performance, and it looks like that business accelerated a little bit. Perhaps you could explain what changed in the course of the three months to make the transactional piece, at least if I'm hearing you correctly, feel a little bit better. Thank you.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Let me start, and then, Amy, you can add to it. Overall, Karl, the focus for us is in what I describe as this hyperscale-plus-hybrid approach when you think about the current approach, which is pretty unique to us. And the way we track progress is to see how is our annuity growth of our server business, and how is our cloud growth. And if you look at this last quarter, our annuity grew double digits and our cloud grew triple digits. And that's a pretty healthy growth rate, and that's something that by design both in terms of the technical architecture as well as the traction we have in the marketplace and our sales efforts and so on are playing out well, and we are very bullish about that going forward.
The Transactional business is much more volatile because of the macro environment, IT budgets, and also the secular shift to the cloud. The question again that gets asked is about the cannibalization. But if you look at Boeing or you look at any of the other examples that I talk about when it comes to the cloud, our servers never did what these customers are now doing in our cloud. So at a fundamental long-term secular basis, we have new growth, new workloads, and that's what we are focused on, and that's a much bigger addressable market than anything our Transactional Server business had in the past.

Thank you, Karl. We'll take the next question, please.

Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Brent Thill - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks. Amy, in Q3 the Transactional business was weak, and you said that the business bounced back in Q4. Was that just a mere fact of you cleaning up some of the slipped business, or did you see additional strength on top of some of those closed transactions on the Transactional business in Q4?
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Brent. Let me split your question into two components. The first thing really that I think Satya and I both focus on every quarter, every month, is how much of our business are we continuing to shift to annuity and specifically to the cloud. We structure all of our motions at this company, from how we engineer to how we do our go-to-markets to how we think about sales engagement to how we do our investments, fundamentally toward that long-term structural transition in the market.
And so to your question on Transactional performance, there were some deals that didn't get done in Q3 that got done in Q4, and there were some deals done in Q4 on the Office side with large companies that I'm thrilled by. But at the same time, we still will focus on those deals moving to the cloud over time. And so this volatility that we are going to see because of macro and because of budget constraints, especially on Transactional, we will focus on because we expect excellent execution and have accountability to do that in the field. But our first priority, every time, is to make sure we are focused on annuity growth and digital transformation at our company, which is best done through that motion.
Brent Thill - UBS Securities LLC
Just to be clear, Amy, in terms of the sales motion, are they incented more towards cloud versus Transactional going into this year?
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Yes.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Absolutely.

Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Satya, I had a question for you on Azure. I was just wondering if you could talk about the percentage of Azure revenue coming from ISVs. And then how do you see this helping you compete with AWS? And can you talk about why these partners may be choosing you over the competition? Thank you.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Sure, let me take that second part in terms of what is our differentiation. And I think in my remarks, I pointed out the couple of dimensions. But overall, I believe this hyperscale plus hybrid architecturally helps us a lot with enterprise customers because we meet them where their realities are today and also the digital transformation needs going forward, so that's one massive advantage we have.
The second area for us is also the nexus between what's happening in Office 365, Dynamics 365, AppSource. And in fact, this last quarter, some of the most strategic announcements were all around our application platform. At our partner conference, there was a significant amount of excitement with the tools that we announced like PowerApps and Power BI, Azure functions and Flow. These are tools that our developers and system integrators and solution partners will use in order to be able to customize applications around Azure. And so to me that's another huge advantage and a competitive differentiation for us.
And then lastly, we have the best support for what I would say is the most open platform for all developers. Not only is .NET first class but Linux is first class, Java is first class. Azure Container service cuts across both containers running on Windows, running across Linux. So again, it speaks to the enterprise reality. So those would be the places where we are fairly differentiated, and that's what you see us gaining both for enterprise customers and ISVs.
The question you asked is an interesting one, which is if I had to slice it by classic ISVs, it would be one-third or so of our revenue. But the thing that – the first question that Keith asked is probably more indicative of what's happening, which is every customer is also an ISV. So every customer who starts off consuming Azure is also turning what is their IP in most cases into an ISV solution, which ultimately will even participate in AppSource. So at least the vision that we have is that every customer is a digital company that will have a digital IP component to it, and that we want to be able to partner with them in pretty unique ways.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
I would also add, Heather, the importance of the motion in our field organization and go-to-market with ISVs is incredibly high in terms of selling with and along with those ISVs, both making them successful and thereby helping us build very important scale through the platform. And we've seen a lot of improvement in the past four quarters on that front.

Great, thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.
Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Thank you. Amy, how much of the weakness in Transactional has been caused by clients that otherwise would have bought a license now under annuity? In other words, are you driving the Transactional weakness to some extent by driving the growth in on-prem? And then I have a quick follow-up for Satya.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
It's probably not exactly how I would say it, Mark. I do believe that every conversation that we're having with customers is cloud-led. That cloud-led conversation and making a plan for customers to best change and transform their own business certainly is a far more in-depth one than on occasion is required by long-time Transactional purchasers, especially in Office, as an example, because what we're talking about now is really pivoting your business for the long term.
And so I'm sure there are examples where that has elongated the sales cycle, for good reason. But I would generally point back and say most of these are driven at the structural level, which is – structurally over time, on-premises Transactional business will move to the cloud or to a hybrid structure through an annuity revenue stream.
Now over any short-term period, the majority of what we have seen is really either a budget constraint, a macroeconomic change, or people, to the question you've laid out, maybe in the midst of making their cloud transition plan, and maybe that has elongated the sales cycle to an extent. But again, I don't view that as negative performance. I view that as strategic relevance long term inside of digital accounts.
Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
That makes a lot of sense. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Hi, thanks. Amy, I'm wondering, you saw very strong unearned revenue in the quarter, but I note that you saw contracted backlog that grew sequentially below what a typical June quarter does and commercial bookings that were up about 4% off of a fairly easy comp. And I'm wondering if you could just help us understand the dynamics in new and renewal signings that drove that combination of really strong unearned but somewhat weaker trends in the bookings.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Sure. Strong unearned in particular was actually better than expected Azure billings in the quarter that drove unearned above the high end of our guide, and I think we were quite pleased by that performance.
In terms of CNB, that's the reference I made in my comments to the lower expiry base. Quarter to quarter and year to year, we just have different amounts of contracts expiring. And so this was one of our lower contract bases and was lower than a year ago. So the fact that we were able to grow in that low expiry base is actually very good structural performance.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Thank you, Walter. We'll take the next question, please.

Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Thank you, two questions on the Office side. First of all, you're obviously reaching very large numbers in terms of the numbers of seats that you have. Can you talk a little bit about what's the seat growth? Because both for Consumer and for Commercial, it seemed to be coming down. Is that the law of large numbers coming in, or is there anything else?
And in the Consumer Office, the Consumer Office performance was very, very strong, and that almost needs to be stronger from transactions because otherwise I don't get to the numbers. Can you talk a little bit about the source of the strength there? Thank you.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Raimo. Let me start with the Office Consumer question. We haven't had a chance to touch on that. And then we'll talk about Commercial seat growth. You're right, the Office Consumer growth still has quite a bit of transactional business to it, even though we have moved, and you saw that growth, the subscriber base, materially.
The growth in quarter versus our expectations was really two things that are transactionally focused. One, the PC market was a little bit better than we thought. And particularly in developed markets, the PC growth was better than we thought. And developed markets are where we see the most transactional business with Consumer Office that impacts in quarter. So the strength from that outperformance or better market in consumer PCs in developed markets is a direct correlation to our performance in Office Consumer. And so that's how to think about that big delta.
The other thing was Japan was a little better. And when Japan is better, it's why you also see the interesting relationship in constant currency. We have a lot of yen exposure in that segment, so the Japan performance being better also helped. And that is a purely – it's more transactional than even our rest-of-world business. So you're right, Raimo, in terms of what impacted that number in quarter versus the underlying market dynamic.
On commercial seats, listen, we're very proud of that big number, growth number. But you're right, we're also getting a very big base. And so while we feel great about continuing to add seats at that type of rate, converting and adding net new into our install base, you will see that growth rate come down just because the business is getting quite big.
Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Very clear, thank you.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.

Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC
Okay, thanks very much and good afternoon. Amy, you spoke about a slowdown in the cloud CapEx growth curve in fiscal 2017. I assume you're referring to the growth in absolute dollars moderating and not just the rate of change in percentage terms. But any additional color that you could provide on the company's CapEx requirements over the course of the next year would be appreciated.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Gregg. You're right, my comments are more pivoted toward the absolute dollar amount, which is what I tend to focus on in my comments. So it's a good clarification, and thanks for asking.
In terms of how we think about the absolute numbers, first I should say I think most people assume – and it is true to a certain extent – so much of this is the growth in our Commercial businesses across Azure and Dynamics and Office 365, and that's true. But we're also seeing quite good growth in some of the Consumer businesses, which also are built on our cloud infrastructure, Search, some of our gaming assets, our Xbox Live business going forward. And so many of these assets, including increased usage of our consumer properties inside our productivity business and Office, do require capital spend. And so the growth is pretty broad-based to support.
And so as I think about moderation, it is the absolute dollar. It's not due to any change in our aspiration or belief in the growth curve of revenue, and I wanted to be clear on that. It really is about continuing to benefit from scale and engineering improvements that will allow us to do that even as we see broad-based growth.

Our next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks so much for taking my question. Amy, I had one on the same lines on CapEx, and I just wondered if you could provide some insights. We're at 26 data center regions today. I think you have 34 planned, so that would imply we're about three-quarters of the way through that spending cycle. But should we view 34 as a ceiling, or is it possible that we could see further data center regions built out beyond that 34? And then I had one follow-up.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Let me start, and then, Amy, you can add to this. In some sense, Ross, you're trying to ask us to project forward and say what is the legitimate digital security and digital sovereignty needs of all the different types of businesses that we want to serve using the cloud all over the world. The position that we have taken is that we want to serve customers where they are and not assume very simplistically that the digital sovereignty needs of customers can be met out of a fewer data center approach. Because right now, given the secular trend to move to the cloud across all of the regulated industries across the globe, we think it's wiser for us and our investors long term to be able to meet them where they are. And that's what you see us. We are the only cloud that operates in China under Chinese law, the only cloud that operates in Germany under German law. And these are very critical competitive advantages to us.
And so we will track that, and we will be very demand driven. So in this case we're not taking these positions of which regions to open and where to open them well in advance of our demand. If anything, I think our cycle times have significantly come down. So it will be demand-driven, but I don't want to essentially put a cap because if the opportunity arises, and for us it's a high ROI decision to open a new region, we will do so.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And I would add, in addition to the number of regions which Satya is talking about, it's also the capacity inside a region. Much of our spend is, as you note, on some of the infrastructure to put in place when you pick a location. The rest of it is continuing to build out in that location the number of servers and networking equipment required. So there are really two components, and I think Satya has talked about why you would enter a region and its ROI, and there's also the correlation to how many servers and that spend and pace over time based on demand.
Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks so much, maybe just one quick follow-up. The server products business that Karl talked about did rebound this quarter, and I think it was up about 4% constant currency for the year. I know you're not guiding that to that number specifically and you talked about potential volatility. But is there any range of outcomes that you're thinking about for that business? Will it grow, is it not clear that it will grow? I'd just love any additional color there. Thank you.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
In terms of server products and services, I tend to think of it as the all-up growth. It's really about growing the cloud, growing the hybrid, and then whatever happens in the Transactional business happens. And I'm very proud actually of the growth this quarter. I think our guide for Q1, given some of the headwinds we expect in terms of support agreements that we talked about in Enterprise Services, continues to expect very healthy double-digit annuity growth, driven fundamentally by Azure in that segment.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Satya, around the LinkedIn announcement, there was a lot of discussion about some of the opportunities to use the assets and information there to help build your HCM and CRM capabilities. And then we fairly shortly afterwards got the announcement of Dynamics 365 and AppSource. So maybe given the amount of discussion here, you could comment on the evolution of the strategy and your thought process around broad enterprise application.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks for that question. So I look at what we are doing with Office 365, Dynamics 365, AppSource, LinkedIn as all being part of one strategy. So the move to the cloud for our customers and for us is not just about a new way of delivering the same value just as a SaaS service. It's really the transformation from having applications that are silos to becoming more services in the cloud where you can reason about the activity and the data underneath these services to benefit the customers who are using these services. So that's what this notion of a graph represents.
So when somebody moves to Office 365, their graph, their people, their relationships with other people inside the organization, their work artifacts all move to the cloud. You can connect them with all the business process data that's in Dynamics 365, but not just in Dynamics 365 but all the applications in AppSource because business process will always be a much more fragmented market as opposed to just one market share leader by industry, by vertical, by country. And so that's our strategy there.
And now the professional cloud or the professional network helps usage across all of that professional usage. Whether it's in Office 365 or whether you're a salesperson using any application related to sales, you want your professional network there. Of course, it's relevant in recruiting, it's relevant in training, it's relevant in marketing. So that's really our strategy with LinkedIn as the professional network meeting the professional cloud. And so you were right to point out that these are all part of one overarching strategy, and ultimately it's about adding value to customers.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Michael.

Our final question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yes, thank you very much. So, Satya, we noticed Office 365 commercial seat growth of 45% produced Office 365 commercial revenue growth of 59% in constant currency, so a favorable spread of about 14 points suggesting ASP growth. I'm wondering if you could help us understand the drivers both now and into the future, particularly in terms of the initial response to the E5 plan, and also which products you think are driving the strength as you consider across Exchange, Skype for Business, Power BI, Yammer, SharePoint, et cetera.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Let me start and, Amy, you can add to it. Overall, I would say even in this last year, even just a broader spread of E3 has driven a lot of the growth. And then of course, we are very excited about E5, but they're very, very early days of E5. And E5 value proposition across all three of the areas, whether it's cloud voice or analytics or security are all three massive areas for us. And I would say if anything, the initial data from our customers around security is gaining a lot of traction. But at the same time, one of the things that customers are looking for is making an enterprise-wide architectural decision across all of the workloads.
So E3, E5, and higher penetration of this is what's going to drive ASP growth. And you will look – you can see – you'll see us add more value to these packages as time goes on as well because our R&D is focused on that, which is how do we take these buckets of value creation and reinforce them with all of the future R&D as well.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.

Welcome to Microsoft's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2016 Earnings Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to turn the call over to Chris Suh, General Manager of Investor Relations. Chris, please proceed.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me today are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. On our website, microsoft.com/investor, you could find are earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provide the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.
Unless otherwise specified, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call. The non-GAAP measures exclude the net impact from revenue deferrals and the impact of integration and restructuring charges. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's third-quarter performance in addition to the impact that these items and events had on the financial results.
All growth comparisons we make on the call relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. We also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. At the segment level, we provide constant currency growth for both revenue and gross margin. However, due to recent change to our external reporting segments, we aren't able to provide segment level constant currency operating expense growth, and consequently cannot derive constant currency segment operating income either. We do provide constant currency operating expense and operating income growth at the company-wide level.
Please note that in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we adopted a new standard issued by the FASB that made certain changes to accounting for stock-based compensation. One of the more significant changes require that excess tax benefits and deficiencies be recorded as part of income tax expense rather than as part of additional paid-in capital. Adoption of the new guidance requires us to reflect adjustments as of July 1, 2015, and hence impacts our previously reported quarterly results for fiscal 2016. You can find additional information in the financial summary slide deck and in our 10-Q filing.
We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website until April 21, 2017.
During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and then the Risk Factor section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
And with that, I will turn the call over to Satya.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Thank you, Chris, and thanks to everyone on the phone for joining. Overall, we had a solid quarter. Amy and I look forward to sharing more about the results and what's ahead. We delivered $22.1 billion in revenue with an operating income of $6.8 billion. We exceeded $10 billion in commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate. We're halfway to our FY 2018 goal of $20 billion. This quarter, we surpassed 270 million monthly active devices running Windows 10. We're proud of our progress and look forward to making more as enterprise deployments accelerate.
Now let's get to the specifics of each of our three segments, starting with Productivity and Business Process. We set out to reinvent Productivity and Business Process because we believe that people should get more out of every moment, and organizations should be able to reach new levels of effectiveness. This approach is opening up new growth opportunity for Microsoft in three ways. We can reach more users, enter new markets, and build a developer platform. Let me talk through each.
First, we are reaching new users and strengthening our productivity platform. Consumer subscriptions of Office grew to more than 22 million. Devices with our mobile apps grew approximately four times year-over-year. Commercial Office 365 customers surpassed 70 million monthly active users, and we grew seats by 57%.
Second, we're expanding into new markets such as security, analytics and cloud voice, where we see an opportunity and where we can differentiate. For example, the cyber security market is expanding rapidly, and it's a place where we have unique capabilities, like Advanced Threat Protection, Cloud App Security and Advanced eDiscovery. This combination drove a 35% quarter-over-quarter growth of monthly active users of our premium information protection services in Office 365. A key driver of this growth is our new premium Office 365 suite, E5.
Lastly, we're making Office 365 more than a world-class productivity and communications service. It's becoming a growing platform for developers. There is an incredible amount of value developers can deliver by harnessing the data in this platform. It can be as simple as Starbucks enabling somebody to email a cup of coffee, or it can be as sophisticated as DocuSign streamlining processes for digital signatures based on the understanding of people's availability and organizational hierarchy. We continue to make advances in our developer platform by expanding Microsoft Graph APIs and opening Skype to developers. This is generating developer momentum. In fact, active apps calling on Microsoft Graph APIs are up month-over-month.
In business process application, our Dynamics product line is expanding to include new scenarios, such as IoT, field service, customer self-service and built-in business intelligence and advanced analytics. For example, Ecolab uses CRM online with Azure IoT, not only to help their customers use water systems more efficiently, but also to predict equipment failure and direct field engineers to respond. And JUST EAT in the UK uses Dynamics AX to make it easy for millions of people to order food for take-outs online. These scenarios are driving new growth. Dynamics CRM online seats more than doubled this quarter with over 80% of our new CRM customers deploying in the cloud. We grew Dynamics AX revenue double-digits.
Now let's move to the Intelligent Cloud segment. The cloud is being built into every organization's quest to optimize and grow. With our results this quarter, it remains clear we are one of the two leaders in this market. Azure revenue increased 120% in constant currency, with revenue from premium services growing triple digits for the seventh consecutive quarter. We are innovating in new areas to help organizations digitally transform. We're expanding our competitive strength in hybrid computing. We're generating opportunity for developers and partners.
To start, we added more differentiation to high-value services in Azure this quarter in three areas that are top-of-mind for our customers, artificial intelligence, IoT, and business analytics. We expanded Cortana Intelligence Suite, our big data and analytics service that transforms data into predictions and intelligent action. It now includes over 20 cognitive services ranging from object-in-motion recognition to text and linguistic analysis. The IoT market is expanding as companies look to deliver new services and value. Our new Azure IoT suite streamlines the process of building IoT applications and acts as a hub for managing and monitoring millions of assets.
Each week, more than 2 trillion IoT messages are processed by Azure, and analytics is another rapidly growing market where Power BI has more than 200,000 customers and 5 million users. Companies like Toyota, BMW, Johnson Controls are all using Cortana Intelligence Suite, Azure IoT and Power BI to transform themselves as well as their industries. Siemens is also using Azure to connect and analyze data from medical imaging systems around the world, helping providers in their effort to transform healthcare. We are the only cloud provider that helps companies embrace the cloud on their own term, and we continue to innovate in areas that make it easier for our customers, including the recently released preview of Azure Stack and by bringing SQL Server to Linux.
A critical part of this flexibility is giving customers tools to secure their data wherever it is, on-premise, in the cloud and across all their devices. We continue to grow in this market with Enterprise Mobility Suite customers more than doubling to over 27,000. This is three consecutive quarters of triple-digit customer growth. This growth is driven by strong adoption across cloud services. For example, more than one-third of our Office 365 Enterprise Suite installed base has also purchased Enterprise Mobility Services.
And as I said earlier, perhaps the biggest impact we can make is to empower developers. To this end, we're making Windows and Azure the very best environments for developers who want to build applications that run across multiple platforms. Our acquisition of Xamarin and the inclusion of Bash in Windows 10 will make it easier to build intelligent experiences and apps that leverage our cloud and run natively on Windows, iOS and Android. We are excited to announce at Build that we are making Xamarin freely available as part of Visual Studio.
Now let's move to More Personal Computing segment. We are reinventing personal computers and personal computing for the mobile first, cloud first world. In this world, what matters most is the mobility of a person's experience, not any one single device. As I shared last quarter, we think about our strategy along three lines. First, we will deliver more value and innovation, particularly for enterprise customers. Second, we will grow new monetization through services across the unified Windows platform. Third, we will innovate in new device categories in partnership with our OEMs.
First, let me talk through the innovation we're delivering that brings new levels of ease-of-use, trust, productivity to Windows and specifically more value to our enterprise customers. What we hear most frequently from these customers is how much they value the advanced productivity security and device management capabilities in Windows 10. In fact, this is what led to one of the most security-conscious organizations in the world, the United States Department of Defense, to upgrade all of their PCs and mobile devices to Windows 10 this year. We see this trend across our enterprise customers with 83% of them in active pilots today. We believe enterprise deployments will continue to drive up the over 270 million monthly active devices running Windows 10. The number of Windows 10 devices is twice that of Windows 7 over the same time period since launch.
At Build, we gave people more reasons to upgrade with the announcement of new features in Ink and Touch interfaces as well as Windows Hello biometric security and deeper integration with Cortana, all coming this summer with a Windows 10 anniversary update.
Second, we are seeing new monetization through services across the Windows platform. Windows Store received more than 5 billion visits. We are exciting about compelling new apps coming from Disney, Square Enix, Bank of America, King, Instagram and many others. We grew the number of universal Windows app developers 60% this quarter. In search, developers have already built over 1,000 apps designed for Cortana. These new third-party experiences and the 6.3 billion questions people have asked are helping make Cortana smarter and driving search engagement. Over 35% of our search revenue last month came from Windows 10 devices.
In gaming, monthly active users of Xbox Live grew 26% year over year, driven by the growth of Xbox One and Windows 10. Xbox One continues to outpace prior generations in both reach and engagement. At the same time, we continue to create synergies between Xbox One and Windows 10 devices. Bringing top Xbox One titles to Windows Store helped grow gaming hours on Windows 10 by 50% over last quarter. And starting this summer, universal Windows apps will run on Xbox One, making it easy to build applications and games that work across devices.
Third, we continue to innovate in new device categories in partnership with our OEMs. We are pleased with the results from Surface this quarter. This is our second $1 billion revenue quarter for Surface in a row, and it's the first outside of a holiday period. Revenue grew 61% in constant currency, driven by Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book. Certainly consumers value these devices, but where we see the strongest momentum is through adoption in the commercial space, with particular strength in financial services, manufacturing and healthcare.
Our OEM partners are also innovating in new device areas for consumers and business customers. In particular, they too are seeing growth in the 2-in-1 device category. As you can see, we think about renewing growth of Windows, we think broadly about where growth can come from. We see early signs of success in Windows driving increased engagement in monetization of services like search, Store, and gaming as well as new sources of revenue from Surface. As we build premium devices and premium categories, we are also stimulating demand across our entire ecosystem.
Ultimately, the largest potential for Microsoft's growth will come through reinvention of personal computers and personal computing as well as the new platforms we create. This broader mobile first, cloud first opportunity cuts across all of our financial segments and technology ambition. And this is what we shared with developers at Build and with business leaders at Envision a few weeks ago. I hope you have had a chance to watch these events as well. We are creating entirely new ways for people to interact with technology and also new ways for them to build technology. HoloLens developer kit is one such example. Organizations around the world like Volvo and NASA are using HoloLens to redefine what it means to build and explore, and Case Western University is redefining how students learn to be world-class surgeons.
Conversational interfaces is another example. We envision a world where people will more naturally interact with their devices in the future through conversation. Imagine simply asking Cortana to book a hotel or being able to order a pizza through instant message and Skype. Conversations will be a new platform that every business, every app and every website will begin to embrace, and we are at the forefront driving this platform shift.
We are building out cloud services and platform to enable every business across every industry to digitally transform themselves and in turn build their own capability to create more digital technology. Empowering people and organizations to thrive in this digital world is central to Microsoft's mission. I am proud of our execution so far and what we have achieved, and I am also grounded in the work ahead of us.
With that, I'll hand over to Amy to go through this quarter's results in greater detail and share our outlook for the next quarter, and I look forward to rejoining you after that to answer questions.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. This quarter revenue was $22.1 billion, up 2% and up 5% in constant currency. Gross margin declined slightly but was up 4% in constant currency. We grew operating income this quarter by 1% and 10% in constant currency. And earnings per share was $0.62, flat year over year and up 10% in constant currency. Our effective tax rate was 24%, higher than we anticipated, which impacted our EPS.
From a geographic perspective, our performance in most markets was as anticipated. However, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa were more unfavorable than we expected. In our commercial business, we continued to see healthy fundamentals, which led to a solid quarter of results. Commercial bookings increased 7%, up 9% in constant currency. Our total commercial annuity business had double-digit revenue growth in constant currency and commercial annuity mix reached 86%, up 4 points year over year.
Commercial unearned revenue grew to just under $18.8 billion, up 3% and 8% in constant currency, slightly below expectations due to a higher mix of contracts with more in-period recognition and some deal weakness in the geographic markets mentioned earlier. Our contracted not billed balance again exceeded $25 billion. Most important, as Satya mentioned earlier, our commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate surpassed $10 billion. This quarter, more than 65% of customers who signed enterprise agreements attached our commercial cloud offers, up 15 points from last year. Our customers continue to make long-term commitments based on our compelling roadmap.
Our commercial cloud gross margin was 45% this quarter, declining year over year. This decrease was driven by a higher mix of Azure revenue, our ongoing investment in data center capacity and geographic expansion, and a small FX headwind. As I mentioned last quarter, even as we are focused on gross margin improvement within each of our key cloud services, our total commercial cloud gross margin will reflect the dynamics of changing revenue mix and targeted investments.
In Q3, the FX impact of 3 points on year-over-year revenue growth was generally in line with the guidance, as the recent weakening in the US dollar created less than 1 point of impact overall and across segments. As Chris explained earlier, we're not able to provide constant currency impact at the segment level for operating expenses, and therefore segment operating income. In general, FX had a favorable impact of 1 point on operating expenses at the total company level. As expected, our company gross margin percentage declined this quarter, driven by our accelerating mix of cloud services and our Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes segment, offset by higher gross margin percentage performance from products within More Personal Computing.
Now to our segment results. This quarter our Productivity and Business Processes segment delivered in line with our expectations, with $6.5 billion in revenue, increasing 1% and 6% in constant currency with higher annuity mix offsetting lower transactional weakness results due to a weaker PC market. In Office commercial, revenue was flat and grew 7% in constant currency, driven by continued momentum in Office 365 with installed base growth across Office, Exchange, SharePoint and Skype workload.
Our channel again expanded this quarter as more than 85,000 transacting partners sold Office 365 to small business customers. Office consumer revenue increased 3% and 6% in constant currency due to an increasing base of subscribers and recurring subscription revenue. And our Dynamics business grew 4%, up 9% in constant currency. We more than doubled CRM online seats for the sixth consecutive quarter. Segment gross margin dollars declined 4%, up 1% in constant currency. As we've discussed, gross margin percentage declined on a higher cloud services revenue mix within the segment. Operating expenses decreased 1%, even as we continued engineering investments in our Office 365 and Dynamics businesses and prioritized spend in growth areas like E5, security and voice capabilities. As a result, operating income declined 7%.
The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered $6.1 billion in revenue, which grew 3% and 8% in constant currency, just at the low end of our guidance range. Our total server products and cloud services revenue was flat year over year and increased 5% in constant currency against a prior year comparable that had 16% constant currency growth. This quarter, our enterprise server customers continued their commitment to our hybrid cloud platform offerings, which resulted in double-digit annuity revenue growth in constant currency, including over 100% growth in Azure. That growth was partially offset by a larger than expected decline in our transactional on-premise server business, which impacted the in-quarter results. Enterprise services continued to perform well, with 11% revenue growth or 15% in constant currency driven by customer demand for our support services and solutions.
Gross margin declined 2% and grew 3% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage declined as cloud mix accelerated, offsetting margin improvements in Azure and enterprise services. In response to enterprise customer demand, and to increase our share in the cloud market, we grew operating expenses by 13% through Azure-focused investments across engineering, additional sales and marketing capacity and the acquisition of Xamarin. This quarter, operating income declined 14%.
Now to our final segment, More Personal Computing. Revenue exceeded our expectations at $9.5 billion, up 1% and 3% in constant currency. First, our OEM results. Our total OEM business declined 2% this quarter, outperforming the overall PC market, which was weaker than we expected. OEM non-Pro revenue increased 15%, driven primarily by a higher than expected mix of premium devices. OEM Pro revenue underperformed the commercial PC market, declining 11% due to the higher inventory level in Q2 that I mentioned in my last earnings commentary. Windows volume licensing grew 6% in constant currency and IP licensing continued to decline, impacted by both a decrease in total unit volume and a higher mix of lower royalty units.
As expected, devices revenue decreased this quarter. Revenue declined 11%, or 9% in constant currency, primarily due to phone, where revenue declined 46% in constant currency. Additionally, sell through of our Lumia products was weak, and we exited the quarter with relatively high channel inventory. As Satya mentioned, momentum in our Surface business continued as revenue increased 56%, or 61% in constant currency with strong commercial and consumer demand for our Surface lineup. Overall, device gross margin dollars grew and gross margin percentage improved, primarily driven by a shift to our higher gross margin Surface portfolio. Our search business remained strong this quarter, with growth driven by higher revenue per search and higher search volume. We again had US PC share growth and search continued to be profitable.
In gaming, revenue grew 4%, or 6% in constant currency with continued progress in the monetization of our installed base. We saw higher revenue from Xbox Live, driven by both higher volumes of transactions and higher revenue per transaction, as well as an increase in revenue from our gaming studios. As expected, Xbox hardware revenue declined, mainly driven by lower Xbox 360 consoles sold and lower Xbox One pricing. Segment gross margin increased 2%, or 6% in constant currency, driven primarily by gross margin percentage improvements in devices and gaming. Operating expenses decreased 14%, primarily through our actions in phone, and the transition of our display business to AOL. As a result, segment operating income grew 57%.
Now back to our overall company results. As planned, we accelerated our data center and cloud services investments to meet growing global demand. This quarter, we invested $2.3 billion in total capital expenditures, including an increase of 65% year-over-year primarily for data centers and servers. Other income was negative $247 million, driven by interest expense and net losses on derivatives, partially offset by dividends, interest income and net recognized gains on investments.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24%, higher than we expected, which reflected the changing mix of revenue across geographies, as well as an accelerating shift in revenue from software licensing to cloud services. The rate for the quarter included a catchup adjustment from Q1 and Q2, reflecting the new full year – the new expected full year non-GAAP effective tax rate. This quarter, we returned $6.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
Now let's move to the outlook. First, on FX. Consistent with our guidance last quarter, we still expect FX to negatively impact year-over-year growth in Q4 by 3 points. By segment, we expect 3 points of impact on Productivity and Business Processes, 3 points Intelligent Cloud and 2 points in More Personal Computing.
Second, our commercial business. Our commercial business will be on pace for continued strong annuity growth, as both new and existing enterprise customers adopt and use our growing portfolio of cloud services. Even with projections of tightening global IT spend and currency headwinds, we expect commercial unearned revenue to be $24.3 billion to $24.5 billion, in line with historic seasonality. We remain on track toward our $20 billion commercial cloud revenue run rate goal, as we grow revenue, drive consumption and focus on gross margin improvement in Office 365, Azure and Dynamics Online. Finally, we will continue our investment in data centers and capital equipment to address customer demand for our cloud services.
With that, let me share our view by segment. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to be $6.5 billion to $6.7 billion, with continued annuity shift to the cloud, offsetting the impact of a weaker PC market on our transactional business and our consumer and commercial segments. In Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $6.5 billion and $6.7 billion, driven by annuity growth, offset by continued transactional weakness. In more Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $8.7 billion and $9 billion.
Here's a bit more detail on its individual components. In Windows, we expect our OEM Pro revenue to be largely in line with the commercial PC market. Our non-Pro revenue is expected to be above the consumer PC market, similar to what we saw in Q3, primarily due to the continued benefit from a strong mix of premium devices. In devices, we anticipate continued momentum and growth for Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book, particularly with business customers. For phone, we expect year-over-year revenue declines to steepen in Q4 as we work through our Lumia channel position. In search, we will continue to show healthy revenue growth with full-year profitability.
Finally in gaming, we expect to see continued healthy user engagement on our Xbox platform, and we look forward to E3, where we will announce new titles for the upcoming fiscal year. We expect COGS to be $7.8 billion to $7.9 billion, and we expect operating expenses between $8.2 billion and $8.3 billion. Our full-year guidance is now down to $31 billion, to $31.1 billion as we concentrate our investments in engineering and technical sales to accelerate our cloud growth heading into the next fiscal year.
We expect other income and expenses to be negative $200 million in Q4. This includes the net cost of hedging and interest expense offset by dividend and interest income. For tax, based on trends reflected in this quarter's full-year catchup adjustment, we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be 21% and 23%. We expect our full-year effective tax rate to be between 20% and 21%.
Before I wrap up, I'd like to share a few directional comments on fiscal 2017. This year we saw strong growth in our commercial cloud portfolio, and we grew our annuity penetration across our commercial business. We anticipate those trends will continue next fiscal year, driving our revenue growth and impacting our gross margin percentages. As we continue to unify and modernize our Windows installed base across our consumer and business customers, we will advance our progress in our post-sale monetization scenarios and execute on the Windows 10 enterprise deployment opportunity.
Throughout fiscal 2016, our significant investment in engineering, sales and marketing has positioned us to support our customers' digital transformations and to innovate in device form factors, like Surface and HoloLens. In fiscal 2017, we expect to continue that investment and reallocation process. Therefore, total operating expenses should be flat to up slightly. I look forward to sharing more on our FY 2017 plans in July.
With that, Chris, let's go to Q&A.

Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please proceed.
Brent Thill - UBS Securities LLC
Good afternoon. Amy, just on the Q4 guide, you're guiding below the Street on many of the individual line items on the top line. I'm just curious, is this more the shift to the cloud? Or is there some demand execution issues that you are seeing in the business?
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Brent. It's really as we talked about transactional weakness in Productivity and Business Process. We're continuing to expect strong annuity growth. We're continuing to expect a strong mix to the cloud. We're continuing to expect ARPU increases, premium mix increases and installed base growth. So really in that segment, it's the PC weakness in our traditional transactional Office business that's impacting that segment. In Intelligent Cloud, it's a very similar dynamic. We're expecting renewal rates to remain strong as they've been. We're expecting the mix to Azure to continue to grow. We're expecting annuity double-digit revenue growth and again it's the transactional weakness that you're seeing overall as well as the very specific geo weakness we saw which I called out earlier. And in More Personal Computing, the largest change in that segment is frankly the phone. So I would really focus on that in that segment. The rest of it, frankly, is quite good.
Brent Thill - UBS Securities LLC
Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Philip Alan Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Hi. Thanks guys for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter. I just want to focus in on Office there. Obviously you call that Office 365 commercial suites you're growing 57% year-over-year, so very consistent with what your last quarter was. And Satya, you mentioned the mix shift as well with the release of E5. Why don't you just provide some color there, sort of I guess a grade of kind of where you are right now and then as you're contemplating guidance for Q4 and then kind of thinking about 2017, how should we think or how are you guys thinking about sort of that Office 365 transition there sort of units and pricing?
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
I can start and then Amy can add. Overall the thing that we are most focused on with Office 365 is how do we make sure that we have the Office 365 end points everywhere and good usage. And I talked about how the mobile end points has been growing and the mobile usage has been growing. I also talked about the 70 million monthly active users of Office. So we feel very good about that, which is users with in terms of coverage and usage. The next place where we are very focused on is really the new scenarios and E5 is obviously a big element of it. I talked about in some detail the security value proposition. That is really showing a lot of good traction for us, but we're also seeing traction in analytics and voice.
So we're in the very early innings of E5, but the value proposition and the TAM or the total addressable market of those three scenarios is huge, and so we remain very excited about it. The other thing that I am also sort of excited about when it comes to Office 365 is for the first time, we're opening up Office 365 not just as a end-user and a enterprise tool in the service, but as a developer platform. In its own right, we think of Office as perhaps one of the most strategic developer assets we have and with the Microsoft Graph API and what we see as activity around it, we think about the platform effects of that as also being very key. So that's at least at the macro level how I look at it and, Amy, if you want to talk a little more.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Again, I think the way that shows itself in our financial results is you'd expect to continue to see the strong mix shift to the cloud. You'd expect to continue to see installed base growth as even some of the items I've talked about have more relevance and continue to make us the value prop higher even in small business, which is where you've seen the user adds. I would continue to expect to see ARPU growth as we see E5 have its impact through the year and so think about these same dynamics still for us where we focus on new users and ARPU increases as we shift to Office 365. Those are trends I'd expect to see obviously as we look into 2017.
Philip Alan Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Great. Thanks, guys.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.
Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Sure. Thank you very much. So if you look at productivity and process and Intelligent Cloud, obviously we're having a margin decrease that's occurring and a good chunk of that is cloud. How should we think about the standalone license business in terms of the margin separated from the cloud side of it?
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
The standalone margins on the licensing business have been pretty stable just because transactionally, we understand and continue to bring down the fixed cost base there and any that's required. So I don't feel like you'd expect any material change in those, Mark.
Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Thank you so much. Satya, I wanted to see if you could share a little bit on Azure, just how you're thinking about the competitive positioning versus Amazon, where you think your strengths are versus them. And also as the business continues to ramp at such a fast pace, how do we think about the progression in gross margin? I mean, Amazon gives us operating margins, but I guess I'm wondering is there reason you shouldn't be able to reach similar operating margins with Azure at a similar scale if we went back and looked at the progression that Amazon's been disclosing?
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Sure, Heather. Thanks for the question. First of all, when Amy and I think about both our CapEx as well as our OpEx, both at the engineering side as well as on our sales and marketing side, we think about this still at a Microsoft cloud level. Just because if you take something like Enterprise Mobility Suite, that gives you an indication of how, for example, we attach to Office 365 essentially an infrastructure service that has SaaS-like margins, or even some of our application services in Azure that attach to Office developer experiences. So we think about this part more holistically, and same thing with Dynamics.
But having said that, if to your specific question of where our differentiation lies, the first one is hybrid. Most people think about hybrid where they think about the cloud as the edge of their server. We obviously support that with all of our servers. Every server product of ours has cloud enrollment right, whether it be SQL, whether it be Windows Server, and you'll see that increasingly, even in this next wave of servers. But we also think of in fact our servers as the edge of our cloud. That I think is where the world is going to go to, where distributed computing will remain distributers. So Azure's stack is completely unique to Microsoft. No one else who is in the public cloud business at any scale has that kind of capability. So I would say that's another point of differentiation.
So to your point about margins, I feel that we actually will have software licenses with hybrid rights. That's a different margin structure. We will have IaaS services, and you talked about the existence, proof at least from Amazon about what margins at scale can be achieved there. We have PaaS services in infrastructure like EMS that have SaaS-like margins, and then of course we have SaaS services in Office 365. So I think the mix of our gross, or rather that mix will define our long-term gross margin and operating margin for our cloud services. But the mix will also shift each quarter, just because the mix is not a stable mix. We'll see growth in different parts at different times.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Excellent. Thank you guys for taking my question. Amy, when you're talking about the transactional declines, particularly (41:11) and the server portion of that, can you help us understand how much of that is due to maybe more macro factors, weaker overall server spending environment, and how much of that comes from perhaps demand being reallocated towards infrastructure as a service offerings that you guys have in Azure? Is there something of a cannibalization taking place within that transactional business today?
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Keith, it's a good question. Let me go through a number of factors that really impact transactional business. First, you're right. There is clearly a macro impact, especially on the transactional business. Transactional businesses tend to be more impacted in emerging markets where we have a higher percentage of non-annuity business that's transactional business. Those have been the weakest markets in this macro environment and specifically some of the geos we called out have more exposure in this place. And so you're certainly seeing the macro impact in the intelligent cloud segment and the server weakness is there.
And because frankly we saw that macro weakness, you have even seen it in terms of server shipments, right. If you look at server shipments, you'd say that's actually a macro statement. We didn't see it in any one particular workload; it's weakness across workloads, which tends to make more sense frankly with a macro or a budget IT spend constraint. And so I actually think between those two items, it's the biggest impact that we've seen in the quarter, and I expect to see it again next quarter, given I don't think the macro or IT spend environment should change in any way between these two quarters.
So I think less about it being cannibalistic because so many of the scenarios in this time period, we've seen the growth we expected. We've seen it across our premium services as well as core compute. I should also say most of the weakness we saw was in the standard workloads, which I think lends itself to again some of those pressures. We also saw, and I would expect annuity shifts there, which is the final component. Our annuity numbers and renewal numbers were very good in Intelligent Cloud. And in fact, they came right where we expected in terms of unearned balances. And so for me, I do tend to think it's a bit more of the macro pressure and budget impacts than it is frankly any other statement or execution.
Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Excellent. That's very helpful.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thanks. Amy, this one for you. I wouldn't mind asking about the gross margin guidance. If I take the midpoint of your revenue guidance, midpoint of your COGS guidance, it looks like you're guiding to another roughly 200 basis point decline in gross margins in the June quarter, which is about what you did in March. So if we look out to fiscal 2017, I know you touched on it a little bit, but just to be clear, it feels like you're guiding to a further year-over-year decline in gross margins. But sounds like that'll be offset in part by continued good OpEx control. So is that the right way to think about it, and is there any way that you could sort of bracket what the gross margin percentage decline might be in fiscal 2017? You probably don't want to give specific guidance, but maybe some high-level color. Thanks.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Directional. Karl, thanks for the question. And you're right. In general, let me spend a few seconds on that. You're right. We saw about a 200 basis point change this quarter. It's entirely due to the shift to the cloud, both in our Productivity and Business Process segment as well as the Intelligent Cloud segment. Those were the exact same drivers in the gross margin change that we guided to in Q4, and I would expect stability as we've seen it in our More Personal Computing segment.
And so as you think about 2017, with the continued acceleration of our cloud mix and actually continued momentum in annuity, I would expect to see those same pressures continue to exist. And you're right in that our strong operating expense focus, because really, this is the quarter when you've been able to see actually in Q2 and Q3 now us really pivoting that investment in OpEx to our Intelligent Cloud and the opportunity we see there across engineering, sales and marketing. And you're right, we do expect to see and continue to do that as we lead into 2017 within the overall envelope I discussed.
Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed.
Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Hi. Thanks. Amy, my question just on guidance and your posture on guidance, a two-part question. I think we've seen you give very conservative guidance say for the first half of this year, and in Q3, you ended up sort of putting it all together at the lower end of your guidance. And I'm wondering, your posture just generally around guidance, if it's changed at all, that you're factoring in things differently and we should think about that range going forward. Should it be more like it's been in the past where you've had very conservative assumptions, or more like what you just did here?
And then the second part is, as you look forward maybe towards longer-term guidance and the prospects of giving longer-term guidance, because I don't think I've seen an estimate spread on a company as large as this in a long time, how are you thinking about possibly giving long-term guidance? What are the factors that are influencing your comfort in doing that, or is it more philosophical and it's something you're not going to do, that's not necessarily dependent on your view of the business?
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Walter. My philosophical position doesn't change much. I give the guidance that I expect for the quarter and I do it on the earnings call to the best of my ability. What you've seen this quarter is in fact the biggest in-quarter delta for us all the time is the non-annuity performance. And in all of our segments, that is transactional business. That is the most impacted in-quarter by budget changes or macro changes. And so the inherent volatility that you are talking about really is about changes in-quarter that we see and the impact of that.
So I don't think it's a philosophical shift. It's just where you see volatility in-quarter has always been in the transactional side of our business. The guidance we gave and our annuity positions in terms of renewals and where we saw them were exactly, frankly, what we expected with the small exception of the geos that I called out. So I tend to think, I'll talk a little bit about 2017, as I always do, come July, give you all more of a shape to that. But I tend to think I like to focus on where the company is going, which is cloud mix shift, annuity growth, and overall worldview of bringing Windows and the ecosystem growth through MPC.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital. Please proceed.
Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks a lot. Amy, I just wanted to go back on the Intelligent Cloud. We did see that deceleration in server product growth, but the comp was very tough, and as you commented, your annuity was up and your deferred growth accelerated. That server product line has grown about 5% constant currency in the last 12 months. I guess the question is, is there any structural reason why, going back to Keith's question, why that would decelerate more ex-macro? And then another question I just had, it's related to this. Can you just remind us in the server product ex-Azure line and in the commercial Office traditional non-365 line, how much is transactional in those two segments? Thank you.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Sure. Ross, let me try to take those. The first question around is there anything structural or different in that server product line, really it has been and is that transactional component. You're right. We continue to see the annuity growth. We continue to see the growth through Azure and the offset to that has been the transactional business. I'm not sure that I would say that there's any structural reason other than, the change in my worldview, other than maybe the budget and macro pressure tend to exert itself on that transactional business. But overall, continuing to see the renewals we've seen, continue to see the cloud growth we've seen, I'm not sure I think of it as a fundamental trajectory change outside of that component we discussed.
In terms of overall, rough orders of magnitude, the Intelligent Cloud segment has the least exposure to the transactional business. It's still less than 20%. But that 20%, right, lends itself in-quarter to the volatility you see. The Productivity and Business Process segment has a bit more transactional exposure just because it has both the consumer and the commercial Office business, which is more attached on a transactional basis to PCs, so it's slightly higher all up.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi. Question for Amy. Amy, you've been able to grow your op income on a constant currency basis nicely double digits as you've been investing in the cloud. As you look at the results this quarter, and as you pointed out the op margins in Intelligent Cloud, and business process productivity that were impacted due to shift to the cloud. Do you think that as you look into next year that the cloud business is at scale, that it continues to grow and take share relative to overall revenue? And the transaction business, who knows, it could be a bit of a macro pressure. Do you think that we're at the point where we could continue to entertain a scenario that op income could still continue to grow nicely as it has in the last three, four quarters? Or is there some other structural changes with respect to the margin of the cloud business? Or maybe the transaction business drops off a lot more dramatically that it may be hard to sustain this nice double digit op income at a very high level without going into the details. Thank you.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Yeah, at a very high level, Kash, let me talk about the opportunity. The opportunity for us across what the cloud makes possible for our commercial business and this moment in time that I am a believer in of where companies are going to change their businesses to rely more deeply on technology than they ever have. I believe that our set up for that is the investments we've been making for the past couple years, as well as the investments we're going to make for the next couple. I mean that both in the capital concept, but also in my operating expense line. We've managed to do that by continuing to pivot to what I believe are these very high ROI opportunities, and pivoting away from opportunities where we've had a chance to become more efficient, and the rate of returns are not going to be as high, or the structural growth isn't there.
And so for me, to your point, at a high-level, I think we can continue to drive revenue, especially annuity and cloud revenue. I think we can continue to improve gross margin percentages in the cloud across all the core cloud services. I think that we can grow profit dollars, and I think that we can do that in the OpEx guidance I gave you for 2017, as we continue to pivot to that opportunity. So I think this is one where my optimism, frankly, for the structure of the market in the segment you chose, and my optimism for our positioning within that market is reflected in that investment number that you have seen. And so I would continue to expect to see us do it.
Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
It's good to see that you still expect profit to grow, because this seems like the new Microsoft, where you're balancing the need to invest strategically, but at the same time trying to grow profits in the near-term versus the old Microsoft, where the investments were made but with a more of a longer-term quote-unquote you never knew when the payoff was supposed to going to happen. So it's good to see you emphasize that you're focused on profit growth, notwithstanding the mix of factors that you cannot forecast.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Thank you, Kash. We'll go to the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yes. Thank you very much. Satya, regarding the announcement that you will release your SQL Server database on the Linux platform, I was wondering if you can walk us through your decision tree, just in terms of what you think the potential risks are, and what you think the potential rewards are of reaching for that level of openness, if you will. And just how impactful do you think that that product can be in enhancing Microsoft's share of the database market?
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks for the question. So the decision logic was driven primarily by what I would say is the increased competitiveness of SQL Server. If you think about where SQL Server now with this new release, SQL Server 2016, it's become a fantastic database for many, many of the workloads, everything from OLTP to data warehousing to BI to advanced analytics for the Tier 1. This is a capability that's been multiple decades in the work, but here we are with very competitive total cost of ownership price competitiveness, but with a technology that is in many cases, as Gartner talks about, at the top of the charts when it comes to all of these workloads.
So now that we find ourselves at that capability, we're saying look, what's the way to think about all the markets that we can in fact take this product to, and the Linux operating system database market is not something that, which is mostly primarily a Tier 1 segment, is something that we never worked in. And so therefore, we look at that as an expansion opportunity, so we take that. We've already made the call that Azure for Linux is first class. We already have 20 plus points of, or 20%-plus of VMs in Azure are Linux, and we'll all increasingly have Linux be a big share of our percentage of what is happening in Azure. So for the first time now, we have the ability to go to an enterprise and talk about their entire data estate across Windows and Linux. Now people don't really move between operating systems. Those choices have been made, but at the same time, now they have a choice around database, and so we think that that's a very good incremental opportunity for us.
Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLC

Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Mark. We'll have time for one more question, operator.

Thank you, and our last question will come from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.
Stewart Kirk Materne III - Evercore ISI
Thanks very much, and thanks for squeezing me in. Satya, I wanted to talk a little bit about just the ISV ecosystem on top of Azure, and where you think that is today, and where you'd hope that potentially to be in 12 months, when we think about the opportunity around sort of platform as a service and building out more enterprise apps. I think you made some comments around some IoT applications there that are now sitting on Azure. What's sort of a good – what should we be looking for in terms of new partners from survey ISV perspective? You've had companies like [Black Box or Replatforma]. I'm wondering, do you expect that sort of momentum to potentially accelerate as we get in further into the calendar year? Thanks.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Yeah, thanks for the question. I mean, I think the overall for me across all of our product lines, whether it be Windows or whether it be Office 365 or Azure, developer momentum, ISV momentum is super important priority for us, both in terms of our developer evangelism, our product engineering teams, as well as everything that we will do to even create success for our partners through our field sales organization is a top of mind priority. And this is something that Kevin Turner, myself and Amy and all of our leadership team is very focused on. So you will only increasingly see us deliver more design wins there. In fact, I'm looking forward to our partner conference to talk much more about what it is that we will be doing in the coming year to drive more success for our partners and in particular ISVs.
The thing that I'm seeing a lot of is we've had traditional strength with SQL as well as .Net. They are moving a significant number of them to the cloud, and in fact replatting to be even multitenant and cloud native. At the same time, we're also seeing a lot of open source ISVs also be part of the Azure marketplace. If you go up to the Azure marketplace today, you'll see that. So we're not only bringing people who have traditionally worked with us, helping them replat to a completely new model but we're also bringing a lot of new ISVs into the fold as well and that's pretty exciting to see.
Stewart Kirk Materne III - Evercore ISI

Welcome to Microsoft's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2016 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Chris Suh, General Manager of Investor Relations. Chris, please proceed.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary.
On our website, microsoft.com/investor, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provide for the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Unless otherwise specified, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on today's call. The non-GAAP measures exclude the net impact from revenue deferrals and the impact of integration and restructuring charges. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They're included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's second quarter performance, in addition to the impact of these items and events had on the financial results.
All growth comparisons we make on the call relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. We also provide growth rates in constant currency when available, as a framework for assessing how our underlying business has performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. At the segment level, we provide constant currency growth for both revenue and gross margin. However, due to recent change in our segment reporting groupings, we aren't able to provide segment level constant currency operating expense growth, and consequently cannot derive constant currency segment operating income either. We do provide constant currency operating expense and operating income growth at the company-wide level.
Please note that we have recast certain prior period items to conform to the current period presentation with no impact on consolidated net income or cash flow. Additionally, any mention of operating expense refers to segment operating expenses as defined in the footnotes of our Form 10-Q and includes research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative, but excludes the impact of the last year's integration and restructuring charges.
We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included on our live transmission in the transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website until January 27, 2017.
During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
And with, that I'll turn the call over to Satya.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon everyone. Today Amy and I will share the results of our second quarter and look ahead. Overall this quarter, we had solid performance and more importantly drove growth in areas that are key to our future. We delivered $25.7 billion in revenue with an operating income of $7.9 billion. We continue to advance towards our goals for fiscal year 2018. Our commercial cloud run rate surpassed $9.4 billion, up over 70% year over year and almost halfway to our goal of $20 billion. We nearly doubled our cloud customers over the last 12 months.
We also made progress towards our goal of more than 1 billion Windows 10 monthly active devices. We crossed the 200 million milestone, and Windows 10 is outpacing adoption of any of our previous operating systems. In fact, adoption is nearly 140% faster than Windows 7. I appreciate the incredible work and focus of both Microsoft team members and our partners to deliver these results.
Now let's get to the specifics for each of the three segments, starting with Productivity and Business Process. As we seek to help people get more out of every moment, we are delivering new innovation and seeing new opportunity with Office 365. Consumer response to Office is strong. Office attach rate is up. Office 2016 adoption is outperforming Office 2013 over the same period of time, and consumer subscriptions are up to more than 20 million.
We're also enthusiastic about how people use Office on other platforms. On iOS and Android, Skype has more than 900 million downloads and Office apps surpassed 340 million this quarter. There are also 30 million iOS and Android active devices running Outlook. Office 365 commercial revenue grew nearly 70% in constant currency while seats grew 59%. It is clear customers value the ongoing innovation we are delivering in Office 365 and this allows us to advance further into markets like voice and information protection.
In December, we released a major update to Skype for Business, which drives productivity up and costs down. Our customers can now use Skype for Business to get a dial tone without the need of their own PBX and conduct online meetings for up to 10,000 attendees.
Security is both a mandate and an opportunity for Microsoft across all our segments. As customers look to protect themselves, we are creating new demand for all of our security solutions. The number of people using our information protection capabilities built into Office 365 increased 25% quarter over quarter. At the same time, we released new capabilities like Advanced Threat Protection, Advanced eDiscovery and Customer Lockbox. These new innovations in voice and information protection accrue to our premium productivity and collaboration SKU E5 which we released last month.
Our Dynamics business is also contributing to our growth in the cloud. This quarter we released major updates to Dynamics NAV and Dynamics CRM, both of which deliver enhancements in mobility, insights and organizational productivity, as well as deeper integration with Azure and Office 365. Three out of four of our CRM customers are choosing to deploy in the cloud, which is driving continued triple digit paid seat growth for CRM Online in the enterprise.
Our momentum with Office 365 and Dynamics creates a compelling case for developers. This quarter, we exposed the data APIs which capture the relationships between people, conversations, projects, schedules, processes and content. We call these APIs the Microsoft Graph. The ability for developers to build on the Microsoft Graph presents a strategic opportunity for our customers and partners. Smartsheet has already taken advantage of these APIs. Oracle plans to use Microsoft Graph to enhance their line of business applications like Oracle Sales Cloud, and many innovative startups are extending it to create new generation of productivity applications.
Now let's move to the Intelligent Cloud segment. The enterprise cloud opportunity is massive, larger than any market we have ever participated in. Last quarter, I reflected on how we are now one of the two leaders in the space. At the same time, we are the only one in this market providing SaaS, PaaS, IaaS and hybrid cloud at scale. We are growing in each of these areas simultaneously. Our unique approach is resonating. Our cloud architecture reflects real world distributed cloud computing needs and services that enable businesses to convert data into intelligence and drive business transformation.
Azure revenue grew 140% this quarter in constant currency, with revenue coming from new and existing customers. We saw organizations like NTT DOCOMO, Honeywell, NASA's Jet Propulsion Labs, Dow Chemical and the UN Development Programme deploy innovative solutions on Azure. We see that Azure customers who also purchase Office 365 consume eight times more Azure than other customers. More than 70% of the Fortune 500 have at least two different Microsoft cloud offerings, up 13 points year over year. And now we're continuing to grow in new ways. Together with Red Hat, Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, we will increase our ability to address real world infrastructure needs. These partnerships give customers the flexibility to connect their existing on-premise infrastructure or Linux-based applications with our cloud.
We are leading innovation in new Agile and DevOps workloads as well, with Azure App Services, PowerApps and Visual Studio Team Services, where we surpassed 3.8 million developer subscriptions. We are adding thousands of new developers every day who are building cloud and mobile solutions that support industries like oil and gas, finance, e-commerce, consulting and healthcare. As we expand into new markets, our revenue from premium services like security, mobility management and analytics nearly tripled year over year. Enterprise Mobility solution customers have more than doubled year over year and we have nearly tripled our share among Fortune 500 in the last 12 months.
Security is now a major driver of the cloud adoption. As threats become more frequent and sophisticated, Azure's unique technology like machine learning empower customers to adapt to these new realities. This quarter we organized the Enterprise Cybersecurity Group to help customers prepare for and respond to attacks. We unveiled plans for new data centers in Germany and the UK that address customers' data access and sovereignty needs. And we continue to release new capabilities like Advanced Threat Analytics as part of our $1 billion product innovation and security spanning Azure, Office 365, Windows 10 and our Enterprise Mobility Suite.
At the heart of every business in the future will be systems of intelligence, powerful AI that helps people understand the past and predict the future. Cortana Analytics is the building block for these systems of intelligence. We released Cortana Analytics last July. It's a comprehensive suite of services that enable businesses to reason over massive quantities of data that emanate from connected people, places and things and converts them into intelligent insights and automation.
Coca-Cola, Russell Reynolds, and the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health System already use Cortana Analytics to dramatically change the way they market products to customers, uncover talent in the workforce and offer patients predictive and more personalized healthcare. Our goal is to make it possible for every company in every industry and every country to take advantage of this new artificial intelligence to transform.
In the More Personal Computing segment, I'm encouraged by our progress to unify our installed base on Windows 10 and to create new opportunities for Microsoft and our entire ecosystem. As of this month, we crossed 200 million active devices running Windows 10. Near term in what analysts predicts will be relative flat market over this next year, we are focused on three ways to drive growth for our partners and for Microsoft: first, deliver more value in innovation, particularly for enterprise customers who need advanced productivity, security and device management; second, grow new monetization through services across a unified Windows platform; third, continue to innovate in new device categories in partnership with our OEMs.
Let me briefly expand on each. First in November, we released the first major update of Windows 10 with solutions designed to address critical business scenarios, security, manageability and ease of deployment. More than 76% of our enterprise customers are in active pilots, including organizations like Kimberly-Clark and Alaska Airlines, and 22 million enterprise and education devices are already running Windows 10. We're well positioned to grow our commercial device footprint in the second half.
Next, as we unify and grow the Windows 10 platform, we grow new monetization opportunities with the Windows Store, search and gaming. This holiday season, we doubled Windows Store paid transactions from PC and tablet customers. This increase is an outgrowth of Windows 10 monthly active devices all up, and the addition of new Windows 10 applications. This quarter, Netflix, Pandora, Uber, Wall Street Journal, NPR released new apps designed to take advantage of Windows 10 experiences.
For example, you can ask Cortana to recognize a song on Shazam, play a movie on Netflix or book a ride via Uber. With search, the clearest indicator of our progress is US search share, where Bing now exceeds 21%. Nearly 30% of our search revenue in December came from Windows 10 devices, partly as a result of user engagement with Cortana. We are seeing increased search engagement and monetization on Windows 10 over previous versions. This holiday, we saw record engagement on Xbox Live. Active users grew to an all-time high of 48 million across consoles and PCs. On December 28, we had more fans using Xbox Live than any other day in the Xbox history. Clearly, with Xbox One now upgraded to Windows 10, a vibrant community joined the Windows ecosystem.
Our games also performed strongly this quarter. We doubled the number of Xbox One gamers playing Microsoft published titles year over year, Minecraft concluded the holiday as the top paid app globally on Windows 10, iOS and Android, and we grew monthly active users by 18% year over year.
Lastly, we're innovating in new device categories and driving growth. With Surface, we created a new type of device, the 2 in 1, and partners are now bringing similar devices to market with success. At the same time, this was the best quarter for Surface ever with over $1.3 billion in sales, driven by the launch of Surface Pro 4 and the initial rollout of our brand new Surface Book. We see more opportunity ahead with Surface Book coming soon to China, Japan, the UK, France, Germany and other markets in Europe and Asia.
We believe in our ability to grow the Windows ecosystem. Near term, we are taking the right steps. We're also clear that long-term Windows growth and vibrancy rests on our ability to reinvent personal computers and personal computing. We accept the challenge as we see it as one of the greatest opportunities to prudently expand into new markets and generate shareholder value.
Before turning over to Amy, I want to briefly reflect on the past few months. I've had the opportunity to meet with customers from all over the globe and observe the effects of the macroeconomic trends impacting business today. Of course, any macroeconomic uncertainty will create pressures for our business. But increasingly I think it also creates opportunity for us. Every organization is looking for ways to gain efficiencies, insights and ultimately transform. This is at the heart of our mission. I believe Microsoft is uniquely positioned to empower them to find new growth areas, while finding new growth for ourselves.
With that, I'll hand over to Amy to go through this quarter's results in greater detail and share our outlook for the next quarter, and I look forward to rejoining you after to answer questions.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. This quarter revenue was $25.7 billion, down 2% and up 3% in constant currency. Gross margin declined slightly but was up 5% in constant currency. We grew operating income this quarter by 3% and 13% in constant currency, and earnings per share was $0.78, growing 11% or 23% in constant currency. We achieved strong results this quarter through targeted investments and innovation, and consistent execution.
From a geographic perspective, our performance in most markets was as expected. The key markets like Brazil, China, Japan and Russia continue to be challenging. Our commercial business once again delivered solid results, as we executed well in a large quarter for annuity renewals. Commercial bookings increased 12%, up 19% in constant currency and commercial unearned revenue was in line with expectations at $19.6 billion or 8% growth in constant currency. In addition, our contracted-not-billed balance reached an all-time high of $25.5 billion.
With our continued cloud growth, our commercial annuity mix reached 83%, up 5 points year over year. This quarter, more than 60% of customers with enterprise agreements attached commercial cloud services, up 15 percentage points year over year. Additionally, we continue to make progress in improving our cloud gross margins. In Q2, total commercial cloud gross margin was 46%, an increase of 9 points year over year driven primarily by improvements in both Office 365 and Azure.
Last quarter, I provided the expected foreign currency impact on total revenue as well as across each of the reporting segments. In Q2, the FX impact came in nearly as anticipated, though the US dollar trended stronger than expected in December. This resulted in less than 1 point of additional negative impact to total revenue as compared to expectations, rounding up to 5 points. Consistent with Q1, and as Chris explained, we're not able to provide constant currency impact at the segment level for operating expenses and therefore segment operating income. In general, FX had a favorable impact of 3% on operating expenses at the total company level.
Now let's turn to each segment's results. This quarter, our Productivity and Business Processes segment delivered in line with our expectations, with $6.7 billion in revenue, declining 2% but growing 5% in constant currency. In Office commercial, revenue declined 1%, but grew 5% in constant currency driven by ongoing strength from Office 365, where revenue increased nearly 70% in constant currency. 80,000 transacting partners sold Office 365 to small business customers, and our installed base continued to expand across Office, Exchange, SharePoint, and the Skype for Business workloads.
Office consumer revenue declined 14%, down 8% in constant currency, ahead of the consumer PC market. Subscribers increased to 20.6 million, attach rates grew and recurring subscription revenue continued to more than offset the impact of the customer transition to the cloud. And our Dynamics business grew 3% or 11% in constant currency, with triple digit installed base growth for Dynamic CRM Online for the fifth consecutive quarter.
We look forward to the upcoming launch of Dynamics AX, our ERP cloud solution built on and for Azure that increases the breadth of our offerings in the business process market. Segment gross margin declined 6%, up 1% in constant currency. The gross margin percentage declined, reflecting the increasing mix of cloud services within the segment. Segment operating expenses decreased 3% as we repositioned resources to align with our highest growth opportunities, and as a result operating income declined 8%.
The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered over $6.3 billion in revenue, slightly ahead of our expectations, and grew 5% and 11% in constant currency. Our enterprise customers continued to choose, adopt and use our hybrid cloud platform offerings which resulted in server product and services growth, revenue growth of 10% in constant currency. Additionally, Enterprise Services revenue increased 10% or 16% in constant currency, driven by our Premier Support services.
Segment gross margin grew 4% or 11% in constant currency. Gross margin percentages were flat as the rapid and continued growth of our cloud mix offset margin improvements in Azure and Enterprise Services. Given the addressable market opportunity and enterprise customer demand, we continued our investment in research and development, as well as sales and marketing resources. This quarter, operating income declined 1%.
Now to our last segment, More Personal Computing. Revenue exceeded our expectations at $12.7 billion, down 5%, and 2% in constant currency. First, our OEM results. Our total OEM business declined 5% this quarter, outperforming the overall PC market. OEM non-Pro revenue declined 3%, outperforming the consumer PC market as we expected, driven by a higher mix of premium and mid-range devices, which led to higher average revenue per license than the prior year. OEM Pro revenue declined 6%, slightly better than the commercial PC market. Pro license inventory is slightly above historical levels, which we expect to work through in Q3.
Windows volume licensing grew 3% in constant currency, with annuity growth, partially offset by transactional declines. IP licensing declined, impacted by both a decrease in total unit volume and a higher mix of low-royalty units. Our search business performed well again this quarter, with higher revenue per search, higher search volume and US market share growth, which resulted in continued profitability.
Devices revenue decreased 26% or 22% in constant currency, primarily due to phone where revenue declined 49% in constant currency, reflecting our change in strategy announced last July. Surface revenue increased 22% or 29% in constant currency, with the launch of Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book, with continued channel expansion and growing commercial sales.
On a constant currency basis, device gross margin dollars declined 18% and gross margin percentage improved, driven by a shift in revenue to our higher margin Surface portfolio. As Satya referenced, we had a good holiday for Xbox. Gaming revenue increased 5% or 9% in constant currency driven by record Xbox Live transactions as well as first party game releases. As expected, hardware revenue decreased due to lower volumes of Xbox 360 consoles sold.
Segment gross margin declined 1% or increased 5% in constant currency. Operating expenses decreased 14%, primarily due to reduced expense in our phone business, as well as a successful transition of display advertising sales to AOL. As a result, segment operating income grew 35%.
And now back to our overall company results. Customer adoption and usage of our cloud services continues to accelerate globally, and we are investing capital into our data centers and servers to respond to this demand. This quarter, we invested $2 billion, up sequentially from the $1.5 billion invested last quarter.
Other income was negative $171 million due to interest expense and net losses on derivatives, partially offset by dividend interest income and net recognized gains on investments. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 19%, in line with our expectations, with the year over year decrease primarily due to an IRS audit adjustment in the prior year, and lower non-deductible operating losses in the current. This quarter we returned $6.5 billion to shareholders, an increase of 42%.
Let's move to the outlook. I want to preface my remarks with three overall comments, and then move to more specific comments by segment. First, FX. I previously stated that we expected the FX impact on total revenue to be about 3 points in H2. For Q3, given the recent strengthening of the US dollar, we now expect an overall impact of 4 points. By segment, we expect 5 points of impact on Productivity and Business Processes, 4 points in Intelligent Cloud, and 3 points in More Personal Computing. And we anticipate continued lessening of FX impacts by segment and on total revenue in Q4, assuming current rates stay stable.
Second, our commercial business. We expect our commercial business to remain healthy with a ongoing shift to annuity as new and existing customers adopt and use our commercial cloud services. Therefore even with continuing currency headwinds, we expect commercial unearned revenue to be within the range of $18.8 billion to $19 billion. Our commercial cloud run rate trajectory remains on pass, with continued focus on gross margin improvement across each of our key services, Office 365, Azure and Dynamics Online, though the total commercial cloud gross margin percentage will be impacted by the mix of revenue.
Third, we will continue to meet global customer demand for cloud services and will increase our investment in data centers and capital equipment in the second half of our fiscal year.
Now let me share some additional commentary on each segment. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of $6.4 billion to $6.6 billion, which reflects 5 points of negative FX impact. This represents 6% year over year growth in constant currency, driven by Office 365 momentum and Dynamics Online.
For the Intelligent Cloud segment, we expect revenue between $6.1 billion to $6.3 billion, which reflects 4 points of negative FX impact. Continued customer preference for our hybrid solutions will drive sustained growth in server products and cloud services and robust demand for Enterprise Services. We expect this business to continue to grow double digits as it has throughout the first half of our fiscal year.
For More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $9.1 billion and $9.4 billion, which includes 3 points of negative FX impact. As this segment has both devices and software, I'll provide a bit more detail. First, Windows. As I mentioned earlier, we will return to normal levels of Pro inventory in Q3. And we expect non-Pro revenue to align more closely with the consumer PC market. In search, Bing will continue to gain share and will remain profitable. For phone, we expect similar year over year revenue declines, and the gross margin percentage for Q3 should look similar to Q2.
After a solid launch quarter, with Surface Book and Surface Pro 4, we anticipate continued momentum and growth with Surface Book expanding into additional countries. And in gaming, we expect normal post-holiday seasonality. We expect COGS to be $7.7 billion to $7.8 billion with variability driven by device sales. We expect operating expenses between $7.7 billion and $7.8 billion. And for the full year, we are lowering our guidance to $31.4 billion to $31.6 billion as we continue to improve efficiencies and invest in key growth opportunities.
We expect other income and expenses to be negative $300 million in Q3. This includes the net cost of hedging and interest expense offset by dividend interest income. We expect our Q3 and full year tax rate to be between 19% and 21%.
In closing, our Q2 results and our Q3 outlook demonstrate our execution discipline and our investment in strategic areas to sustain long-term growth. We remain focused as we both create new markets and take share in existing ones.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Chris for Q&A.

Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Philip Alan Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
All right. Thanks guys and congrats on a great quarter. I just wanted to focus in on commercial cloud and Azure specifically. I mean commercial cloud as you mentioned, the run rate was up $9.4 billion. I mean that's up $1.2 billion quarter to quarter, 70% year over year. That's a higher growth rate than even last quarter. Azure similar thing, accelerating growth versus even last quarter. Sort of a question for Satya and I'll follow up for Amy.
So Satya, when you look at the growth rates there in commercial cloud and particularly Azure, you talked about new customer wins, but also existing customers transitioning more workloads to Azure. Hoping you can give us maybe some more color there as far as what you're seeing and kind of about how you're thinking about the growth going forward there.
And then Amy, based on our calculations, it seems like Azure had a pretty meaningful improvement in just the gross margin year over year. I'm wondering if you could help us with the two curves in that business and where we are in Azure's call it gross margin life cycle, the fixed costs and the variable costs and how you're thinking about that. Thanks.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Phil, for the question. The way we think about our cloud is how I described it in my remarks, which is, it's the combination of the work we're actually doing in the SaaS, PaaS, IaaS and also our hybrid cloud layer, because we don't think for example of our servers as a distinct part. But it's in fact the edge of our cloud, and we're building for that with things like Azure Stack. So we think what we have done here by bringing these things together as one architecture for distributed computing and how people will consume applications and build applications in the future, we speak to more of the real world needs I think of an IT organization or a business organization that's trying to transform through digital technology.
I mean if you put yourself as a CIO of a organization, in a multinational organization and you want to operate in multiple geographies with different regimes for data sovereignty, and then you want to be able to take some workloads, move them all to the cloud, some you want to be able to tier with the cloud, that's the kind of flexibility we provide. And we also see network effects between if you're using Office 365, you want to extend the data in Office 365 by building applications that join it with some other data inside of our Data Lake service in Azure. Obviously Azure becomes the natural choice for such application development and we're increasingly seeing that. So that's really our strategy. Our strategy is not to compete in these constituent parts independently with different competitors, it is to bring one architecture and really drive the value for our customers because of that.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And Phil, let me quickly cover I think your gross margin question. You're right. We did actually make significant progress in both Azure as well as Office 365. And then the mix of those obviously impacts the overall commercial cloud gross margin. What's important, the dynamic's actually quite similar even though the services are quite different. There's really two fundamental components to gross margin improvement.
Number one is obviously scale efficiencies and where we are in that curve, which we are doing and continue to make consistent improvement in. The next obviously is the mix of premium services, and Satya talked about some of the increasing mix of premium services in Azure. That's been encouraging, especially in existing customers over time and through adoption curves. And Office 365, as you know, we continue to be excited by our premium mix in the commercial segment. And so those two combinations each quarter impact it as well as the overall.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Great. Thanks, Phil. We'll move to the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Excellent. Very nice quarter guys, and thank you for taking the question. Satya, you mentioned both new and existing customers increasingly using the Azure cloud. I was hoping you could give us some color into what that looks like, specifically when an existing customer starts using Azure in terms of how does their overall spending get impacted? And what happens to their spending for the more traditional server and tools? How does that get impacted as people use the Purple Cloud (34:50) utility more and more?
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Yeah, I mean the thing that we sort of notice is that with anyone who has moved to the cloud, there is a real opportunity for us to expand to multiple workloads over time, because it's a design win. It's like essentially an ISV win in the client server area, where you could get someone to build on your core infrastructure. They build their first application, and it turns out that once you've done that, you would want to look at our infrastructure for a second workload and third workload. So that's one side of what's happening with the expansion.
The other side of the expansion is what I also referenced, which is if you're an Office 365 customer, you have data in Office 365, you want to build applications that tap into that data, then you use Azure. So that's the other piece. The EMS growth is also very much related to that, which is if you deploy Exchange online, you have Azure AD and then the natural expansion from there is the full EMS suite with device management for all your mobile devices and also Advance Threat Protection and what have you. So we see both those trends from an application workload development synergies as well as infrastructure from identity management, device management work out.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.

Brent Thill - UBS Securities LLC
Good afternoon. Amy, macro's on everyone's mind. I'm just curious if you guys could comment a little bit about what you're seeing. I know it may be too early to see some of the weakness that others have seen, but how are you looking at the demand environment? And how does that change your plans as you look sort of towards the back half of the year? Does any assumptions change in your mind?
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Brent, for the question. The geos I specifically called out obviously were we're the most impacted and they're the bigger geos. But really, I think the focus that we have here is how we can best execute no matter what the macro environment turns out to be, focus on our own execution, focus on continue to drive cloud services, focus on continue to drive annuity mix. Those movements actually and as we help customers transform, it's really the best plan in the face of any uncertainty, which you're clearly asking me about. But I tend to probably focus more on what we can control versus the external environment and how we can best react to that.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Brent. Okay, we'll take the next question, then.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Heather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Thank you very much. I was just wondering, Satya, you mentioned, and I know there's been a lot of questions on Azure, but you mentioned strong growth in compute and SQL usage on Azure being up, I think you said 5x. I was just wondering if you could give us your take on how you see the mix of Azure workloads. I mean is it right now more new workload growth and there's, it's very little existing workloads moving over? I'm just trying to get a sense for kind of how you see the wave cresting for new workloads versus existing workloads that can migrate over. And I'm also wondering if you see it helping you to take share. You mention it's kind of like a design win or an ISV win. I'm wondering if you could share with us how this might be impacting your share versus say Linux or versus other types of infrastructure platforms. Thank you.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Yeah, the thing, Heather, the move to the cloud has done for us is expanded the market opportunity that we have had more than ever before. In some sense, if you compare it to the TAM of STB versus what we now describe as intelligent cloud, we're operating in a much bigger market. And that's because first of all the move to the cloud combines a whole bunch of different categories as well as takes something that you mentioned, which is Linux. We now have the ability to take Linux workloads and run them first class and over 20% plus of Azure is Linux workloads, which was sort of a growth opportunity we tapped into with the cloud which we didn't have previously.
And even take something like EMS, which is a service you could say in the past we participated with Active Directory, but we, and some amount of system center. But now with the growth of actually mobile devices and SaaS applications, our opportunity with EMS is much bigger than anything that we had in the client server era. So clearly we are migrating some workloads and structurally, some of that helps us because we have that position in the client server space. But when we look at what we're doing in the cloud, it's mostly about attaching to one of the secular growth trajectories going forward, be it open source Linux development, mobile use and SaaS applications. So those are all things that we participate in which we didn't participate in the past.
Heather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.

Thank you. Our next comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.
Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Thank you. Satya, Amy, congrats on the quarter. So I got a question for Satya, and then a quick follow-up for Amy. Satya, following up on the cloud discussion, recognizing that SaaS, PaaS, infrastructure as a service, hybrid are all related. But as Azure continues to grow fast and become a bigger part of the business, how should we think about the opportunities or the opportunity size for PaaS versus infrastructure as a service? PaaS is much smaller industry-wide today, but is the opportunity is big, bigger? How should we think about that? And then a follow-up for Amy.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
The opportunity I believe in both cases is high, because it just comes in different forms. IaaS growth comes because people already have existing code that they want to move over, and then they start extending by writing more PaaS because it's sort of more efficient for them to write new code and new apps in PaaS. So I think that depending on what. If you're bringing something over, your IaaS will be heavy first and then PaaS will grow. If you're starting new, you will have PaaS, which is going to be the first thing you do, but then you'll always find the need to go integrate with something that was already existing, existing data, existing code in a virtual machine.
So I myself, in fact one of the things that Amy and I do, is when we think about our CapEx, we think about all these layers together. In fact we amortize our CapEx across all of these and we pay attention to margin and premium mix. Because what we have come to understand is customers, depending on where they start, how they start, have different mix profiles. So it's the all-up, as long as we're growing our premium services attach and margins for those remain strong, we feel that the mix can be different and it's okay. And we really want to speak to the needs of the customers more than any product strategy goal we have.
Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Perfect. Thank you. Amy, a slightly different topic. Free cash flow grew 25% year on year, much faster than the other metrics. How should we think about this trend continuing?
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
That was impacted, Mark, in the prior year by some integration and restructuring charges on the cash flow statement.
Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Okay. So it's really a one-time event more than anything else.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Yes, just always make sure you check the integration and restructuring in the prior year.

Thank you. Our next question come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.
Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hey thanks for taking my question and congrats from me as well. Quick question for Satya. Now that Windows 10 is on 200 million devices, what do you see on the developer network, because one of the big aims was you have a uniform platform for developers to go against the PC, tablet, et cetera. What do you see in terms of them kind of starting to embrace the platform and use the opportunity there? Thank you.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Yeah, thanks for the question and yeah, you're absolutely right. That was one of our biggest strategic objectives was to get active devices and with Store integrated into the installed base and in the user experience so that we could increase these successful developers. And we're seeing good early signs. In my opening commentary, I talked a little bit about both the increased visits to the Store and transactions as well as the fact that we are attracting new applications from developers like Netflix to Wall Street Journal to others. And as you can imagine, our share is today in desktops, in emerging in tablets, in 2-in-1 and of course now with Xbox as well, which is you know got great attraction to gaming developers. So those are the natural places where you'll see us gain more developers and gain more traction. We are big believers in a unified developer platform and a unified Store, and then as Windows 10 monthly active devices increases and the Store usage increases, we'll see more and more developers take advantage of it.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed.
Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Hi. Just a numbers question for Amy. I noticed your long-term unearned revenue was up quite a bit. I mean that's kind of been a flattish trend and it was paired with commercial bookings being much stronger I think than I was modeling. I'm wondering if you could just help us understand what drove the unearned and how that contributed to those commercial bookings?
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Sure. A couple things Walter, which I know you recall. We do have a bit of lumpiness in our expirations. As I said on the call, this was a big expiration quarter for us. And so on occasion what that does, even with the negative currency impact on C&B, is have a bit of lumpiness over time. Now that being said, I want to point to the core, which is that renewal rates were very good, and a big quarter. There was very strong performance on that front, very strong performance in moving customers to annuity as well as to the cloud. So aside from a bit of the lumpiness that you do note and we have from time to time, the execution in the quarter was very strong.
Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
And then if I can just one other numbers question. It looks like in the Q you called out actually Windows Server declining as an offset to Intelligent Cloud growth. And I'm wondering, we haven't seen that comment in the Q before. Was there something sort of one-off driving that or any further detail on that?
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
The way I'd think about that one, Walter, is in general, our premium or enterprise workloads across Windows, SQL, System Center, et cetera, grew double digits. And so some of that weakness frankly is in the non-annuity and very transactional business, which happened to impact Windows Server a bit more than other workloads. And that is where in macro pressure on occasion shows itself first, and then some of that non-annuity lumpiness. So that's the nature of that comment.
Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Great. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thank you. Amy, relative to your Q2 guide, the upside surprise really came in the personal computing business, and at least relative to our third quarter estimates, it's again the personal computing guidance that beat. I'm wondering if you could repeat the key factors that are contributing to the out-performance in that pretty important business? Thank you.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Sure, Karl. In Q2, let me talk about two key ones. Number one, it's really the device launches. We actually launched a very broad portfolio of devices into the quarter. With Surface Pro 4, Surface Book, Band 2 and the Lumia 950 and 950 XL. And so between all of those hardware products, as well as our gaming performance, another sort of hardware component in quarter, we did a little better than we had expected in our launches. Now when you launch mid quarter, there's always some timing aspect to that, but I feel very good about the execution of those and that is a meaningful component of that out-performance. The second one, which I talked about is OEM Pro. We did a little better in the quarter than I expected, but inventory levels are a little higher. I expect to work through that in Q2, I mean Q3. And that was a couple points of impact, for example on OEM Pro in quarter.
Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay, great. And then, Amy, for the third quarter, your guide for that business is also pretty good. Is that due to some of these similar factors? Or are there one or two others that are driving the what appears to be pretty solid 3Q performance in that unit as well?
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Well, it's similar drivers. In that segment, there's also some topics I tend to not get asked about in Q&A. Let me take the opportunity to talk about them. Which is one, our search performance continues to be very good. Frankly, our display business has been quite good. And if you go beyond that, I feel good about our gaming business sequentially. I feel good about the hardware, especially the Surface performance as we launch into more geos. And so if you think about all of those components, which actually were very similar to Q2 in terms of their strength, you see them again in Q3. And so I'm not sure there's anything quote-unquote new, Karl, I would say, other than that bit of mix between OEM Pro, a little bit pulled into Q2 versus Q3.
Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Terrific color. Thank you, Amy.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America. Please proceed.
Kasthuri Gopalan Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi, thank you very much. Congrats on the quarter. I was curious to get your thoughts, Satya, on the Windows 10 upgrade cycle in the enterprise and also the consumer market, particularly after you anniversaried the free offer for Windows 10. And secondly and finally thoughts on Surface. It's off to a great start, at least the latest model. Could that play a more important role in the corporate computing landscape? Thank you. That's it for me.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Kash, for the question. As far as the upgrade momentum, the fact that we crossed 200 million active devices, we feel very, very good about that. And the pilots, the place which in the second half is going to be a huge focus for us is the enterprise deployment, and that's where I think there's real excitement because of some of the core capabilities of Windows 10 when it comes to security, manageability. That I think is going to create great value for enterprises, and that's showing up in all the pilots. In the accelerated, I've never seen a Windows release in the enterprise with this level of accelerated deployment planned. So we obviously need to do a great job in continuing to push that, and we're focused on it.
As far as Surface, Surface is playing an increasing role for us in both consumer as well as in the enterprise market. And also we just, we created a new category of 2-in-1s where even our OEMs are finding success, which was one of our strategic objectives of doing the Surface. And so overall, we do think that this tablet that can replace your laptop is ideally suited for productivity needs, which means it's great for your personal use as well as your use inside of the enterprise, and we continue to see good growth.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
I would just add one thing, is that we've actually announced a number of important partners to help us take the Surface portfolio into commercial customers. And I think we'll expect to see progress on that over the course of the year.
Kasthuri Gopalan Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
If I could, your excitement is pretty palpable. What could be driving that 140% increase in adoption relative to Windows 7? We all thought XP to 7 was a major transition, but it looks like there's another big transition happening here.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
I mean I think there are two aspects of it. We have a good operating system release for the core desktop user, and second, I believe is that we also expand out into new usage patterns. If you look at even the thing that we're seeing is in terms of engagement, with the browser or things like Xbox Live with the Store, or new device categories like the 2-in-1, all I think make it much more possible for users to engage with Windows in more mobile formats and in more productivity scenarios. So I think it's the combination of all of that. But it starts with having a good product truth which Windows 10 does deliver on.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks very much and congratulations from me as well. Satya, I had a question on commercial Office 365. I don't know if you gave us the number, but I think the last couple of quarters you talked about monthly active users. And I'm curious if you have an update on that number. And then I also was curious about thoughts around ARPU, because you introduced the E5 SKU in December. Where are we on the path of penetration, if you will, with the higher value SKUs and the ability to see price lift across the base over time. Thanks.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Yes and Amy you can add. I mean I think, that's right, last time we talked about the 60 million monthly active users for Office 365 and that continues to grow. In fact there is always, and I think we also talked about how we get licenses sold and then, or subscriptions sold and then there's deployment. And there's always lumpiness as well as increased deployment that happens once the users migrate, and we'll continue to track that and we'll continue to disclose those numbers as they come along. But I feel very, very good in the growth of that. And I think the best proxy for you really beyond any numbers we talk about in terms of monthly active is our capital, because if you look at what we do, is we spend our capital only to really fuel the growth or to service the growth of usage across Office 365 and Azure, and you see that increasing.
And then in terms of the margin profile, I mean the entire story of having the E3 mix first to be high and now E5, that's the thing that Amy talked about, which is we now have good premium tier value in all of our products, in Office 365 that's most evident with E3 and now E5. Even in Azure, we have things like EMS, we have our data services, even our developer services. So I think all of, both of our cloud products, the major cloud products have these premium tiers that the mix shift to those or the addition of those is something that we're focused on and we see in our results
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
That's right. I would just add that we did see that premium mix go up in Office 365 on the commercial side as you were noting. And really E5's only been in market for the last month of the quarter. We're excited about the number of customers that are trying it and that all the value it offers. But I would expect that to be a longer term evolution as opposed to in Q2.
Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Can I just ask a quick follow up, Amy? That was great. Just on Windows just so we all calibrate correctly, you've had this benefit from the RPL comps from last year. Should we think about Windows really now beginning to trend in line with PC units, or can there still be some variability around that? Thanks.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Yes, in my guidance comments, I talked a little bit about that. On the Pro side as I mentioned, we'll have a couple point impact that would make a difference between that on the Pro side. And I would expect, I think we actually even talked about that last quarter, that the RPL delta which we've seen in Q1 and Q2 would go away in Q3 and Q4 and it would trend much more similarly to the overall consumer PC market.

Thank you. And our last question will come from the line of Ed Maguire with CLSA. Please proceed.
Edward Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC
Hi, good afternoon. I wanted to ask if you've been able to quantify some of the uplift since you've been opening up Office to different platforms like iOS and Android and now with the recent alliance with Red Hat, opening up a lot of opportunity to Linux developers. Have you been able to quantify how much uplift you've gotten? And how do you see this impacting your broader market opportunity?
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Let me sort of speak to it in generic terms because I don't think we have sort of quantified it as narrowly perhaps, just to address those specific moves we made. But overall, the way we have thought about it is, we want to make sure the Office subscription, both to consumers as well as to enterprise subscribers, is valuable across all their devices because it speaks to the vision that we have, which is the cloud is what enables the mobility of the human experience across all of the devices in your life. Because increasingly, there will be more devices and we want to make sure that we're adding value and if we add value in that context, you will be more inclined to retain or purchase the Office subscription. So that's been our goal and that's working well and it sort of shows up in our all-up growth.
And similarly with Azure, we're making sure that as people are tapping into the cloud and moving to the cloud, we can get all workloads to be as first class as on Azure. So that's why we've done the deals with Red Hat. We even did previously deals with Oracle. So Azure is a complete open platform where of course you can run all the Windows workloads, the .NET workloads. But we're increasingly seeing the open source workloads, the Linux workloads, the Oracle workloads, the SAPs and what have you. And more interestingly the mix of all of them because the enterprise is heterogeneous. It has been heterogeneous. We participated only in a portion of it, whereas with Azure, we can participate as the total open platform. And that's how we thought about it and that's what we're executing on.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Ed, and thanks everybody.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.

Welcome to the First Quarter Fiscal Year 2016 Microsoft Corporation Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Chris Suh, General Manager of Investor Relations. Chris, please proceed.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel.
On our website, microsoft.com/investor, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provide the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Our website also includes information related to our new financial reporting segments announced in September.
This is also the first quarter that reflects the revenue recognition accounting for Windows 10. As a reminder, we report Windows revenue prior to any accounting adjustment in our More Personal Computing segment. The corresponding revenue deferral for Windows 10 sales is then reported in corporate and other in our segment reporting.
Earnings commentary today and going forward will focus on results prior to the net deferral impact as we believe this is the best reflection of business health. Unless otherwise specified, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call. The non-GAAP measures exclude the impact of last year's integration and restructuring charges and the current Windows 10 net revenue deferral. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's first-quarter performance in addition to the impact that these items and events had on the financial results.
Additionally, any mention of operating expense refers to segment operating expenses as defined in the footnotes of our Form 10-Q and includes research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative but exclude the impact of last year's integration and restructuring charges.
All growth comparisons we make on the call relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. We also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying business has performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. At the segment level we provide constant currency growth for both revenue and gross margin. However, due to the recent change in our segment reporting groupings we aren't able to provide segment-level constant currency operating expense growth, and consequently cannot derive constant currency segment operating income either. We do provide constant currency operating expense and income growth at the company-wide level.
We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission and in the transcript and any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website until October 21, 2016.
During this call we will be making forward-looking statements which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm looking forward to today's call. This quarter we delivered $21.7 billion in revenue and group profit. Also as part of our commitment to balance capital returns, we meaningfully increased our quarterly dividend and continued our stock repurchase plan.
More importantly, we are focused and making progress towards the goals for fiscal year 2018 that we shared six months ago. Now more than 110 million active devices are running Windows 10. We are well on our way to reaching 1 billion Windows 10 active devices. People are moving from needing to choosing to loving Windows.
Similarly we are making great progress towards our goal of $20 billion in annualized commercial cloud revenue run rate, which now exceeds $8.2 billion. The results speak to our differentiated cloud strategy, expanded market opportunity and the speed at which customers are adopting our service.
As I reflect on the quarter, it is important to note that we are investing in significant addressable markets where we also have meaningful differentiation. Today we'll walk through our financial results for the first quarter and discuss how we are delivering new innovation and growing users and usage across each of our three segments.
Let's start off with productivity and business process. Clearly, how people work has changed dramatically but one thing remains true, everyone wants to get more out of every moment of their life. After all, time is our scarcest commodity. That's why we set out to reinvent productivity and business process. The recent release of Office is a big step forward. We designed Office 2016 and Office 365 to take the work out of working together. We want to help change the nature of work within organizations of all sizes by focusing on the mobility of the person's experience, enabling collaboration and building a rich service that spans all aspects of how people work today.
This approach is resonating with both our consumer and commercial customers. More and more consumers are using Office across device platforms, which is driving Office 365 growth. There are now more than 18 million consumer Office 365 subscribers. We surpassed 200 million downloads of Office Mobile, more than 1 billion to-do lists have been created so far in Wunderlist and more than 0.5 billion people manage their documents and photos in OneDrive.
We continue to see strong adoption in the commercial space as well. From our largest customers, such as Kraft, GE, Louis Vuitton, to schools and small businesses around the globe. Of note, commercial Office 365 monthly active users grew to 60 million with nearly 60% of our installed base using premium workloads. And we added 50,000 new small business customers in each of the last 19 consecutive months.
As customers move to our cloud, it enables us to deliver even more value and push for new growth by entering new categories. Information protection is a great example where we have done this because of natural synergies with our existing services. In fact, nearly 20 million people already use our new premium information protection capabilities in Office 365. That's a tremendous validation of how the cloud accelerates the adoption of new workloads and grows our ability to monetize new value in the $10 billion information protection market.
The new organizational analytics market is another area where we see growth opportunity so we are investing with our acquisition of VoloMetrix, a powerful cloud-based tool for analyzing organizational productivity. The ability to visualize how people engage with others inside and outside an organization is something the cloud is uniquely suited to do. It is exciting to be on the forefront of creating a new technology category. This illustrates how our vision for productivity goes beyond helping individuals to empowering groups of people and entire organizations to accomplish more together. Our addressable opportunity will expand further as we launch more advanced security, voice and analytics workloads in our new premium Office 365 SKU next quarter.
Let's talk about business process. With Dynamics we are making great progress in breaking down the boundaries between business process, collaboration and productivity to truly empower organizations. The companies I talk with every day are under pressure to grow revenue while differentiating themselves on customer experience. It's one reason usage of CRM is growing. Dynamics CRM Online enterprise seats more than tripled year over year. Dynamics AX revenue also grew double digits as the operational system for agile business processes. And we have a new release for Dynamics NAV for small businesses that is tightly integrated with Azure, Office 365 and Dynamics CRM.
Moving to the intelligent cloud. Before I talk about the great progress we are making with our intelligent cloud platform, I want to pause and reflect on where we are as an industry. While many companies are developing commercial cloud offerings, there are really only two driving enterprise cloud platform innovations at massive scale, Amazon and Microsoft. We push each other and we each have a unique approach. Microsoft has bet on a strategy to build a hyper-scale public cloud as well as reinvent servers as the edge of our cloud. This approach gives customers a true hybrid distributed computing platform that reflects their real world needs. Our unique hybrid approach coupled with high value services is clearly a structural advantage.
It's great to see our customers like Walmart, jet.com and Alaska Airlines seize the benefits of the cloud to transform and push for growth. Azure revenue and compute usage more than doubled year over year and we are continuing to channel our innovation into high growth scenarios with new features and services. In the last quarter alone, we have made major updates spanning Azure app services for building enterprise web and mobile apps, Azure Data Lake for infinite data management and analytics, advanced threat analytics which help organizations identify breaches and threats using behavioral analysis.
CIOs are increasingly adopting our Azure premium service for security and manageability. Enterprise Mobility services has more than doubled to 20,000-plus customers. Our installed base has increased nearly 6 times year over year making EMS the largest mobility and identity management solution in a new and growing market.
Our acquisition of Adallom, an innovator in cloud security, will bring customers with ability and control over application access and company data stored across popular cloud applications including Office 365, Salesforce, ServiceNow and many more.
To be a worldwide cloud player, global scale is a must. With that in mind, we launched new data centers in India bringing our global total to over 20 regions, more than any other major cloud provider. We aren't just selling into these countries, we see the cloud as an accelerator of local economies by offering tools that empower emerging businesses, transform public sector services and create value for new local partners. Our differentiated hybrid capabilities mean customers get to choose how they adopt the cloud and distribute their workloads. This in turn is driving the growth of our server business. Premium versions of Windows Server, SQL Server and System Center all grew double digits.
Lastly, we reached a big milestone with SQL Server, one that has been 20 years in the making. The database software market is still one of the largest and now we are an unparalleled leader in Gartner's Operational DBMS Magic Quadrant. That speaks to our differentiated vision in the category and the value we deliver to customers and we are certainly not done innovating. This milestone with SQL juxtaposed with our rapid growth in Azure and its position in the cloud Magic Quadrant shows the overall strength and progress we are making with our intelligent cloud platform.
Now let's shift to progress in our More Personal Computing segment, specifically how the launch of Windows 10 is sparking new growth opportunities for the entire Windows ecosystem. As a platform company, we think about bringing the needs of multiple constituencies together, developers, IT professionals and users, and we have seen great response from all three. There are now more than 110 million monthly active devices running Windows 10. The majority of the upgrades in the first 10 weeks were naturally from consumers and are three times that of Windows 7 over the same time period after launch. We are also seeing a fast start to business adoption with more than 8 million business PCs now running Windows 10. We are adding more enterprise features and we are making it easier for businesses to buy and support Windows devices.
Our early success in attracting developers' apps and store visits is also growing. Our stores have seen 1.25 billion visits and developer revenue per download has grown four times since the Windows 10 launch. Developers are responding to the opportunity, including Facebook, which will release universal apps for Facebook, Instagram and Messenger.
Windows 10 is also driving increased usage of other Microsoft services. Specifically, Bing's share is up to 20.7% in the US and advertising revenue grew 29% worldwide, helped by Windows 10 users asking Cortana more than 1 billion questions.
Further in gaming, we have also seen an increase in active users as we extend our gaming experiences from the console to Windows 10 PCs. Xbox Live continues to grow active usage and every day nearly half of the Xbox One user base is engaged in the service. It'll be a great holiday for all gamers. The beta release of Minecraft for Windows 10 is off to a strong start, with players having already placed over 0.5 billion blocks. And next week we are excited to launch one of the most anticipated new games this holiday with Halo 5: Guardians. This new Halo includes an epic hunt for Master Chief along with groundbreaking multiplayer matches on Xbox Live. As a result, I confidently predict that time will become much more scarce for Xbox One owners starting on Tuesday.
We see all of this Windows 10 usage as an early indicator of our ability to drive growth over the lifetime of a device. Two weeks ago we took the next major step in our journey with announcement of new Windows 10 premium devices from us and from our OEM partners. It's an incredible lineup across a broad spectrum of categories from the new Surface Pro 4, Surface Book to Lumia 950, 950 XL, to Microsoft Band 2 and HoloLens developer edition. Early reviews are generating excitement with customers and we are delighted that our preorder sales are reflecting the positive sentiment in the market.
We're also seeing hundreds of new device designs from our partners, the widest range ever for this holiday. It's clear that by bringing together our applications, operating system and hardware, we will invent new personal computers and new personal computing.
Overall, I'm proud of our results this quarter and I'm optimistic about our growth prospects. We are poised to seize the opportunity of the largest technology shift of our generation with the enterprise cloud. We are increasing users and engagement in services that cross every aspect of a person's life, from Office at work to Xbox at home, while at the same time we are positioning Windows for growth. Our transformation is well underway. Quarter after quarter we build new capability, we enter new markets, scale our new businesses and new business models and we are being disciplined in our execution.
I'll now handed off to Amy to talk about this quarter's results in greater detail and I look forward to rejoining you after to answer questions.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. Before addressing this quarter's results, I want to briefly comment on the reporting segment change we announced during the quarter. We believe our new segments in combination with the supplemental metrics and the profit measure of operating incomes provide transparency into our progress against our ambitions. As Chris mentioned, my commentary today on our results and outlook will reflect the new segments and excludes the net revenue deferral impact of Windows 10.
Last quarter, we discussed the material impact that foreign exchange movement would have on our financial results through fiscal 2016. In Q1, the FX impact on total revenue was 5 points, with most of the impact in the Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes segments given their high annuity mix. This was in line with the expectations we shared in July.
This quarter, revenue was $21.7 billion, down 7% and 2% in constant currency, primarily due to the changes we've made in our phone business. Gross margin declined by 3% but was up 3% in constant currency. We were thoughtful with operating expenses, realizing savings but investing as well. As a result, operating income grew 1% or 11% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $0.67 growing 3% and growing 15% in constant currency.
We continued to see solid performance across most developed markets while the challenging macro conditions in Brazil, China, Japan, and Russia persisted this quarter.
Commercial results are now included in each of the reporting segments, therefore each quarter I will cover overall commercial results in my commentary. Our commercial business continues to be healthy, with momentum in cloud services and a higher annuity mix across all segments. Commercial bookings were slightly better than we expected and grew 10% in constant currency. We executed well on expirations and commercial unearned revenue came in as expected, growing 3% to $21 billion, up 10% in constant currency. Our contracted not billed balance was more than $23.5 billion, in line with seasonality for the quarter.
As Satya remarked, our commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate surpassed $8.2 billion, growing nearly 70% year on year and in line with our expectations. Consistent with the revenue pattern across our commercial business, we typically derived the largest volume of renewals and new agreements in June and consequently see a lower sequential growth rate in Q1. Importantly, our commercial cloud gross margin percentage improved again sequentially from Q4 as we benefited from increasing scale and efficiencies. As I will talk about shortly, our leading indicators around usage, new cloud services and customer demand remain healthy, and we are clearly on track for our $20 billion goal in FY 2018.
Now, let's turn to the detailed results of each segment. Our Productivity and Business Processes segment, which is made up of commercial and consumer Office including Office 365 as well as Dynamics delivered $6.3 billion in revenue, declining 3% and growing 4% in constant currency.
In Office commercial, revenue grew 5% in constant currency and was slightly better than we expected. Increased channel sales capacity, a higher adoption of premium services and continued installed base growth all contributed to our performance. We saw broad-based Office 365 seat growth across both large enterprise and the SMB customer base.
Office consumer revenue declined 4% in constant currency, better than the underlying consumer PC market and slightly better than we had expected. This quarter, recurring subscription revenue more than offset the impact of customers transitioning to Office 365.
Our Dynamics business grew 12% in constant currency, slightly better than we expected. Growth was driven primarily by Dynamics CRM Online. We continue to make progress by investing in product innovation organically as well as adding capabilities through acquisitions like FieldOne and FantasySalesTeam.
Segment gross margin declined 6% but grew 1% in constant currency. Gross margin percentages have been impacted by the mix shift toward our rapidly growing cloud services, including our consumer properties like OneDrive. As Chris mentioned, this year we can't provide constant currency impact at the segment level for operating expenses and therefore operating income. That said, FX in general as at the company level had a favorable impact on operating expenses, which declined 6%.
The Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes our portfolio of server products, Azure cloud services and Enterprise services, delivered $5.9 billion of revenue, up 8% and up 14% in constant currency, in line with our expectations. Our differentiated cloud platform offerings and rapid pace of innovation continue to be compelling to both new and existing customers.
Segment gross margin grew 8% or 15% in constant currency. We continue to invest in research and development resources to realize the large and growing addressable market opportunities and are accelerating our plans to add incremental sales capacity to support growing customer demand for cloud services. Segment operating income grew 14%.
Now to our final segment, More Personal Computing, which includes Windows, devices, gaming and search. Revenue was $9.4 billion, declining 17% and 13% in constant currency, mainly due to the changes in our phone strategy. As Satya mentioned, since the launch of Windows 10 in late July, we have seen solid momentum in our ecosystem and with our customers. And importantly, we saw positive engagement and usage signals across services like search and gaming that provide post-sale monetization opportunities.
Overall, our OEM business declined 6% this quarter, outperforming the PC market and better than we had anticipated, driven primarily by non-Pro OEM. As we discussed previously, this was a transition quarter as the ecosystem moves to Windows 10 and we believe overall inventory in the channel is at normal levels as we head into holiday. OEM non-Pro revenue declined 4% as we saw OEMs focused on premium devices aligned to the Windows 10 launch. This drove a richer mix to market leading to improvement in the average revenue per license. OEM Pro revenue declined 7% slightly ahead of the overall commercial PC market.
Windows volume licensing grew 4% in constant currency with annuity growth in mid single digits. Search revenue increased to more than $1 billion this quarter and we passed an important milestone as our search business reached profitability.
In our devices portfolio, revenue declined 49% and 45% in constant currency, mainly due to phone revenue which decreased $1.5 billion. As expected, Surface revenue slowed with the market anticipation of a new Surface Pro device for the holidays. Surface continues to gain ground with businesses and schools, creating opportunities for our rapidly growing partner channel which includes Accenture, Dell and HP. Both the number and size of deals in our commercial segment for Surface have increased double digits year on year.
This quarter in gaming, revenue grew 6% in constant currency. We saw growth in Xbox Live transactional revenue and our first-party game portfolio, offset by declines in hardware revenue due to lower volumes of Xbox 360 consoles sold. Government gross margin declined 10% or 4% in constant currency. Gross margin percentages were flat year over year, excluding the phone. Segment operating expenses declined 13% due primarily to lower phone expense. As a result, segment operating income decreased 4%.
Now back to our overall company results. As usage of our cloud service grows, we will continue to invest capital into our data centers and servers globally. This quarter we invested $1.5 billion to support that demand-driven growth. Other income was negative $280 million due in part to foreign currency remeasurement and interest expense. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 21%, below our guided range. This was driven by the change in geographic mix of our earnings and lower nondeductible operating losses associated with phone. This quarter, we returned $6.9 billion to shareholders, up 51%. This includes our recently announced 16% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.36.
With that overview of the quarter, let's move to the outlook. I'll start with some overall comments and then move to a discussion by segment. First on FX. Based on the current rates and the forecasted geographic mix of revenue, we expect 4 points of negative impact on total revenue in Q2. By segment, we expect a 7 point drag in Productivity and Business Processes, 6 points in Intelligent Cloud and 3 points in More Personal Computing. In H2, we expect the impact to lessen to around 3 points in total, weighted toward our segments with the highest percentage of annuity.
Next to our commercial business, which we expect to remain healthy in Q2. Our annuity mix should trend up with good execution on contract renewals and continued adoption of our commercial cloud services. Accordingly, we expect commercial unearned revenue to be within a range of $19.5 billion to $19.7 billion, benefiting from these positive trends. With the ongoing increase in cloud demand, we expect to accelerate our investment in data centers and capital equipment for the remainder of the fiscal year, expanding geographic coverage and capacity.
Now let me share some additional thoughts on each segment. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of $6.6 billion to $6.7 billion. Adjusted for 7 points of expected FX impact, the revenue growth reflects the continued momentum of Office 365 and our Dynamics portfolio. And as Satya discussed, with our new E5 SKU in Q2, we're expanding our opportunity into security, analytics and voice.
For the Intelligent Cloud segment, we expect revenue of $6.2 billion to $6.3 billion, including a 6 point FX impact. Our hybrid approach continues to drive growth in our server licensing business and robust growth in our services. Gross margin in this segment will reflect the accelerating mix of cloud services.
We expect More Personal Computing revenue to be $12 billion to $12.4 billion, including the 3 points of FX impact. Because of the mix of devices and software in this segment, let me provide a bit more context. First on Windows. Overall in Q2, we expect our OEM business to look similar to Q1 with non-Pro outperforming the underlying PC market. As we move deeper through the fiscal year, the device mix should evolve as our OEM partners produce more models at a wider range of price points. In search, we expect Bing's strong trajectory to continue, remaining profitable for the remainder of the year.
We will continue to see the impact of the phone restructuring. Revenue declines and gross margin percentages in Q2 should look similar to Q1. And with the strong holiday Surface lineup, we expect revenue to grow in Q2. Gross margins will reflect the mix of device life cycles between Surface 3, Surface Pro 3 and a growing mix of Surface Book and Surface Pro 4.
We expect COGS to be $9.7 billion to $9.9 billion, with variability driven by the device sales. We expect operating expenses between $8 billion and $8.1 billion in Q2. For the full year, we are lowering our guidance to $31.9 billion to $32.1 billion. We are and will continue to thoughtfully reinvest operating expense savings to accelerate growth in key areas, to expand our addressable market and transform how we work, to better deliver products and services to our customers.
We expect other income and expenses to be negative $300 million in Q2, similar to Q1. This includes the net cost of hedging and interest expense offset by dividend and interest income. We expect our Q2 and full year tax rate to be between 19% and 21%. Similar to Q1, this reflects the changing geographic mix of revenue as well as lower nondeductible operating losses associated with phone.
In closing, during Q1 we exceeded our own expectations across many of our businesses and more importantly, we saw healthy indicators of future growth. Through business model transitions and strategic shifts, our solid execution paired with a focus on achieving our bold ambitions has enabled us to take share in existing areas while we enter new ones.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Chris for Q&A.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Amy. We'll now move to Q&A. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and a very nice quarter indeed. I wanted to ask about the Azure in particular and the public cloud performance that you saw this quarter. It again seems like you're seeing an acceleration in that overall business and more broadly it seems like industry-wide both you guys and AWS are seeing something of an inflection point going on in terms of more and more business accruing to those public cloud environments. So my question is just that, would you agree with that statement that there is an inflection going on in the business? And if so, what do you think is causing that and is there a changing nature in how people are using that cloud? And then maybe for Amy, is there something we should bear in mind in terms of your traditional business, sort of the on-premise business that may be impacted as that inflection takes place that we should bear in mind as you go forward?
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Yeah, I'll start, Keith, thanks for the question. Overall what we have seen is the public cloud or cloud infrastructure makes it much more possible for businesses of all sizes and developers of all sizes to get at infrastructure with much less friction than ever before. I grew up in our server business in the past. We were definitely the one to democratize servers by bringing servers to small businesses. But when I think about what's happening for example in Office 365, where we are adding 50,000 small business customers who now get the most sophisticated server technology, but now as a SaaS service, that's what's really happening world over with all application categories and that's where the growth is.
I don't know long-term whether there is a zero-sum equation, but right now and in the intermediate timeframe, we see in our case growth in both sides. And in our case the vision also we have for distributed cloud infrastructure is just that, it is distributed. So we don't think of our server as a legacy business. I think of it as the edge of our cloud. If you look at what we are doing with SQL, we will have the ability for any customer of SQL to stretch even a single table from between their on-premise to the cloud. Those are the kinds of things that we are excited about.
But we clearly are seeing very rapid growth and adoption of our Azure cloud. But in our case there are two unique aspects. One is this true distributed hybrid. And second is we don't think of Azure in isolation. We think about it in the combination of Office 365, Dynamics, EMS, because really it's one cloud infrastructure first of all from a capital perspective that sort of serves all of these and there's a virtuous cycle between all of these for our customers as well.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And Keith, your second question, the place you'll actually see it will be in the gross margin percentage. As Satya said, I do expect both to grow, both the on-premise and the cloud. But I expect the mix to increasingly shift toward the cloud given its sort of robust growth rate, which will impact the gross margin percentage over time.
Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Excellent. That's very helpful, thank you.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Keith. We'll take the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.
Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Thank you. Congratulations on the quarter everyone. Two questions, but related. Let me give you the first one. The commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate grew slightly from $8 billion to $8.2 billion or a little more than each of those. You had Office 365, Azure, Dynamics CRM Online, and all of them seem to be growing very fast. How should we think about the difference? Should we figure that the run rate reaccelerates next year? Next quarter, excuse me. And then I have a follow-up.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
The way to really think about that number just because of some of the seasonality in our business, Mark, is to think about the year-over-year growth rate of 70%. For me that is more symbolic of how you should think about the pace. And that is a very fast number on a increasingly growing base.
Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
That makes perfect sense. Thank you. The second one is the cloud margins improved nicely. Given the data that's in here, it looks like they've all started to move up. Azure seems to move up. You'd said in the FAM the gross margins for 2015 (37:31) should be about 44%. How should we think about cloud gross margins for 2015? I know you don't know obviously the mix of all the cloud products, but how should we think about the improvement there?
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Mark. Looking in the old segments, I know you all have done, we saw a year-over-year improvement in the overall commercial other segment that we disclosed this time too of about 10 points year over year. We saw sequential improvement from Q4 to Q1. We're still focused on continuing to have that sequential improvement, and especially as some of the things Satya talked about, which is the addition of premium services, the pace of innovation especially on the premium end. And if you think about our launch of E5, which is a premium SKU in Office 365, it continues to give us the opportunity to both get more efficient in the infrastructure and to add higher margin products especially at the fast end.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Yeah, just one thing that's structurally I think, that we think a lot about and we're very disciplined about is our capital allows us to build all of the cloud services from Office 365 to EMS to Dynamics to Azure. And that diversity of workloads long term is what lead to margin improvement. And there will be changes in seasonality from quarter to quarter, but structurally those two things, the diversity of what we are doing and how capital is utilized across all of it is I think a big structural differentiator for us.
Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Beautiful. It's great to see that improvement happening. Thank you very much.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Thank you, Mark. We'll go to the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Philip A. Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Hi. Thanks guys, and congrats on a great quarter. Just a question for Satya then a follow-up to Amy. Satya, you talked about your good adoption of Office 365 on the commercial side both in SMBs and large enterprise. I wonder if you could just break that down and where you're seeing the faster adoption as you start to get into the enterprises, especially that might have enterprise agreements with Microsoft. How is that sales motion going and what is the pitch there?
And then to Amy, I thought this was a key point, something that we've been looking for. You noted that the subscriptions recurring business now has offset the cannibalization on the license. Is that something that we should think about going forward or was there something specific about this quarter that would push that out? Thanks.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Yeah first, as far as the Office 365 usage itself, I talked about some of the numbers of 60 million monthly active users, the fact that our seats grew 66% year over year. The small business number I talked about, the 50,000 per month additional customers that we're adding to Office 365. These are all the growth numbers and the usage growth numbers. The mix even, that information protection, I mean that's just another very important point which is amongst the customers who are using Office 365, already 20 million are using some of these premium services like information protection. And of course we're going to further expand that with new SKUs and new categories that are going to become part of Office 365. So I see that stretching on both sides, which is to small business on one end and then these premium SKUs on the other end. And we see nice attach as far as EAs to the cloud as well and that's definitely a big driver of our growth.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And so let me take the second and I'll add something to what Satya said. One of the important things that's distinct about the small business market is that there tends not to be much of a lag in terms of buying and deployment. They want to be able to instantaneously use and get value very quickly and that's something we've actually seen and a real testament to our ability to add so many customers in every quarter. And what you've seen in consumer side, which it was an important point. Once we've built this installed base up to 18 million users on the consumer side, that recurring rate does in fact offset the deferral from new, and so it is an important inflection point for us this quarter.
Philip A. Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Thanks guys and congrats.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks. Next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Heather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great, thank you. I just had two quick questions. I was wondering, Satya, if you could give us a sense for just a high level commentary about the split of IaaS versus PaaS and Azure and maybe some color on the growth you see in each of those and how you see them evolving. And then the second question would be related to the launch of Windows 10. You gave the Bing example for the month of September and the solid pull forward there, or pull along there. I'm just wondering if you could share with us any other areas where you're seeing a similar kind of pull along with Windows 10 adoption. Thank you.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Sure, Heather. On the first one, on the mix between IaaS and PaaS and SaaS, the thing that we are seeing is, quite frankly, all of these are growing but the most interesting thing for me as a pattern is growth in IaaS leads to growth in other PaaS services or SaaS services. I mean to put it very concretely, take something like Azure Active Directory. That's probably the best manifestation of the virtuous cycle that we see in any of the cloud adoption that we have, right. It could be as someone coming from Office 365. It can be someone coming from Azure, Dynamics, EMS. All of those tenants get into Azure Active Directory which is our largest PaaS service because it's got even developer API, so that means more developers are using it.
More IT professionals are using it as the control plane. So that's the network effect that we see when it comes to the PaaS services. And then in terms of infrastructure itself, as again I said, there's people who are tiering, even applications people who build hybrid applications where the storage could be even on premise in some cases, but the mid-tier and the web and the mobile back ends are in the cloud. We see a lot of growth there. We see a lot of growth in our data, both in terms of infrastructure but in the new services like our Data Lake services which are PaaS services. Hadoop is another good example. We see lots of Hadoop usage inside of IaaS but we also see HD inside growth. So I would say there is a real good mix of those two.
And then on Windows 10, I mean I'm very, very excited obviously about what's happening with Bing. I think Amy talked about we have a $1 billion quarter with 29% growth and good share position growth in the United States. That's fantastic to see. But gaming is the other place where we talked about Xbox Live now that spans both console and PC. We see increased engagement because of that. We see in fact increased engagement with titles like Minecraft. So we have some high hopes for what we can achieve with engagement around Xbox Live across the console plus PC.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please proceed
Brent John Thill - UBS Securities LLC
Good afternoon. Satya, Michael Dell mentioned with you on stage a week ago that he's seen from his perspective stronger Windows 10 adoption among enterprise customers faster than he had seen in the past. And I'm curious if you're starting to see a halo impact where those that are looking to move up are saying we want to go with more of the complete infrastructure set? And are you seeing different sales motions among those enterprise customers as those customers are coming back to you?
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Brent. I mean that is absolutely the fact, case, that is we are seeing a much faster adoption cycle, obviously starting with the consumer side but even the 8 million business PCs that are already running Windows 10 before we have started in fact the push on enterprise. We expect the enterprise deployment to start in earnest the beginning of next calendar year or the second half of this fiscal year. But to your point, the fact that there is pull already is a very, very good indicator of, and a good sign, and it's even better than what we saw with Windows 7.
And so to me that's all positive news, and but yet we're very, very focused on delivering I think new value to the enterprise customers. Because if you look at Windows 10 we've already talked a lot about all the consumer value. But just take security itself, I think that Windows 10 represents a real breakthrough in terms of security on the endpoint as well as in embedded, which we are really excited about in terms of driving the enterprise upgrade cycle.
Brent John Thill - UBS Securities LLC
Real quick just for Amy on cash flow, is there anything that we should take into account this year versus what happened last year?

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.
Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Beside Azure in the intelligent cloud, you obviously have very, very good momentum on the classic server and tools business. Can you talk a little bit about the volume versus price effect that you see playing out here and how is it now and how do you expect that to play out going forward? And one of the things on Azure was usage, and you mentioned how that kind of improved quite significantly. Satya, can you talk a little bit where you see that current usage standing and where do you think that can go? We obviously didn't get a number, just a growth rate. But where do you see usage? Because that's obviously one of the things that one of your competitors keeps talking, trying knock on you. Thank you.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Yeah, I mean I think the usage number is the one that, Raimo, that we talked about, which is doubling of compute, doubling of storage. We talked about the growth of our EMS, which is a higher level service. We talked about the growth in Active Directory. So we have usage growth in Azure which is very, very healthy.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And on the server question you asked at the beginning, let me say that we did see I think around 9% constant currency growth of the core server product, and a lot of that was premium driven. Now, I have a distinction between a price question that you sort of asked versus seeing the value of a premium SKU. And so I do think it was premium driven as opposed to sort of a price driven in particular.
Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Perfect. That's helpful thank you.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Thank you, Raimo. Next question please

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thanks very much. I wouldn't mind going back to Windows 10. Three months ago on the June quarter call, the messaging was that Windows 10 would not likely lift Microsoft's performance results until the second half of fiscal 2016. Yet it feels like as early as this first quarter, it's creating a lift at least to the Windows OEM business. And I just wanted to understand what's changed in the last three months such that it's having an earlier than expected positive impact on Microsoft. Thank you.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Karl. Why don't I take that and Satya can add. In particular what we saw this quarter was really as much about the mix of the devices that the OEMs are bringing to market as it was in the absolute unit distinction. And you saw that in the non-Pro revenue performance. And so for us I think really the way to think about the early signs of the impact were the strong device mix, some higher priced units across a wide variety of OEMs as we build into holiday, did provide some slightly better than expected results, as you noted in the non-Pro business. But really some of the other upside that we saw in the quarter was from things that are the second sort of derivative of that, which was our search results were better than we had thought. Because of some of these results about where the PCs were upgraded and the pace at which they were upgraded.
And so I do think we are encouraged, as Satya said. But we're a quarter in. And I think what's exciting for us is really the opportunity we have going forward. We're excited about Q2 when the devices hit the shelves. We're excited to have so many first party devices in Q2. And then the next stage after that which is really the enterprise deployment, which as Satya mentioned, we expect in the second half of the year. So it's early, but you're right, we did see some incremental improvement over what we expected.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Karl.
Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed.
Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Hi. Thanks. Amy, I'm wondering if you could talk about on the computing side, the personal computing side, you talked about this quarter seeing growth ahead of the PC market. You alluded to a diversity of devices coming in the second half. How do you think about that variable in the model say beyond this sort of launch period where you have a little bit of a differing mix going on in devices and you get to more of a steady state out in kind of years two and three of the Windows 10 launch? Do you think you can grow ahead of the PC market? Or do you think – I know for the last few years you've grown below the PC market. Just wondering how we should think about that.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Walter. Let me talk a little bit about what I said in my outlook. This quarter, as I just talked about, the non-Pro outperformance versus the market was really due to a higher revenue per license. I expect that actually to continue in Q2. I expect our overall Pro business to remain in line with business PCs. Once we work through sort of the end of XP bump, that really should be in the line. And as we talked about, as we move through the year, I do expect things to more normalize overall in terms of RPL comparisons. But I do think that's probably the best way to think about the curve over the course of the year.
Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
And then on the commercial licensing part, specifically within productivity, I know you sort of had an old breakout and a new breakout where we don't see commercial licensing necessarily within Productivity. But would you expect that piece, the commercial licensing within Productivity given the transition going on to be stable? Or would that decline as you see the transition over to the cloud in Productivity specifically?
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Let me try and if I missed the question or misunderstood it, you can help me again. I think you're asking about our core Office commercial business, the product side versus the service side.
Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Correct.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And really, okay good. The trend we saw there, as I said, we're 5% up in a constant currency basis. That was 70% cloud minus 8% on prem. That's a trend that's not new for us. We've thought about making this transition as quickly as possible, but what we're seeing, which you heard us talk about, was a transition to increasing premium mix, selling more workloads, doing all of that while we're growing the installed base.
So if you think back to how we've talked about the long term, the lifetime value equation, it's those components that I really think about proving out over time, and we had lots of encouraging signs about that. New users, Satya referenced on the small business and mid-market side. Premium mix, we talked about how many premium services we're now selling. And then in terms of renewals, they're quite good, which we talked about. And so I think all of those, when you talk about should we expect the traditional business to be in decline, I don't think that's new. I think what's important is our ability to switch it to the services and add more over time that really I focus on.
Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Okay. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yes, thank you very much. Amy, I see the commercial bookings numbers in the KPI sheet, but I do not see the total bookings numbers. I'm wondering if you could just comment on that so that we can try to maintain a consistent analysis there if it's relevant. And also, Satya, now that SQL Server has taken over this number one position in the Gartner Quadrant for the database market, could you help us understand how the roadmap evolves from here? As we did notice Amazon made its debut also in the leader's Quadrant, and I think we're trying to understand how the movement to cloud platforms like Azure could further alter the database landscape and how you could capitalize on that.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Why don't you go first.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Yeah, I'll go first. I think the data architecture that underlies what's happening in the enterprise underneath applications is going through a dramatic change. That said, the relational database itself remains still a very strong component, but not the only component anymore, in both on-premise and off-premise. And what we want to make sure as a company is to cover all of that landscape with a very rich data platform. So if you look at what we're doing, the length and breadth of our ambition as well our delivery today, everything from what SQL itself is doing, we have now all in-memory workloads for OLTP, BI, data warehousing built in. We have the ability to now tier even the database with the cloud. This is all the things that are coming in SQL 2016 and we're excited about that.
When it comes to the cloud itself, we have a PaaS service with SQL, which is very unique in terms of SQL Azure. We have now the Data Lake service for basically petabyte, exabyte scale data management. We have higher level data services like Azure ML, which is about advanced analytics, a category we didn't even participate in the past. So we've entered that category, Revolution R fits into that.
So we have a very rich story and this is not even talking about some of the other end-user BI capabilities like Power BI. So I think we have a very rich vision and execution on what is an expanding data platform opportunity. And it's nice to see us innovate on the new services while we also in what is still the big market, which is the relational database market, claim a leadership position.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And Mark, on the total bookings number, the reason we moved to commercial bookings is it's a far more comparable number to look at period to period. Total bookings, because the volatility frankly in consumer businesses in times like the holiday periods, it can make it far more volatile than usually what many of you have been asking for, which is the continuity and health of the overall commercial business. If you want to get to total bookings, you just add back in all the consumer revenue, is technically is how you would do it. But I do think the more helpful KPI for us in terms of bookings is the commercial one.
Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thank you.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Great. Thanks, Mark. Operator, we'll have time for one final question, please.
Operator
Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks so much for squeezing me in and congrats on the quarter. Amy, I just had a couple. The first one, just your comment that the consumer Office business you're seeing, basically the subscription revenue now being larger than the offset, if you will, the license side, where do we stand with regard to that on the commercial side of the Office transition?
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
The way to think about that how is I look at – well, the way I would generally say it is you look at each of the KPIs we give. So the Office commercial business grew 5%. It was negative 8%. If some transition earning back off the balance sheet, the total cloud is 70%. When we start to get to this point and the percentage we already have in the cloud, it is really an offset. And that's probably frankly been true a little bit longer than we talked about technically in terms of what goes off and what comes on given we've now got, as Satya said, 60 million users and more than that in terms of seats sold. Now that can technically, Ross, be interesting in certain quarters of the year where we have very heavy expirations. And so it just depends year over year, but that's why the commercial is slightly harder to do it on because there's some volatility in the ins and outs based on seasonality.
Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Just if I think about the incremental subscription revenues from the commercial side versus the license declines, it sounds like this year, this fiscal year, we're making that pivot like we have made on the consumer side. Would that be a fair statement?
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
I want to make this simple and unfortunately it's just slightly complicated. Because so much of our installed base was already on an annuity contract, it makes the transition mathematically hard. I think what you're asking is specifically for a transactional component when the old transactional component has gone. But it's a very hard – but that's a component of the number, not the total. So it's why it's technically difficult to answer the question you're specifically asking, Ross. But the way I would think about it is we are moving such a substantive piece of our EA business and with our annuity mix all up in commercial, up to 86% percent, we're feeling very good about our ability to transition people at LTV and grow the business overall at a very high level.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.

Welcome to the fourth quarter fiscal year 2015 Microsoft Corporation earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I'll now turn the conference over to Chris Suh, General Manager of Investor Relations. Chris, please proceed.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me today are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel.
On our website, microsoft.com/investor, is our financial summary slide deck, which is intended to follow prepared remarks and provide the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP measures exclude the impact of impairment, integration, and restructuring charges, and are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's fourth quarter and fiscal year performance and the impact of these items and events had on the financial results. The non-GAAP financial measures provided above should not be considered a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Unless otherwise specified, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call.
All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. For selected metrics on the call and in other earnings materials, we have provided growth rates in constant currency. We present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuation.
Additionally, any mention of operating expense refers to segment operating expenses as defined in the footnotes of our Form 10-K and includes research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative, but excludes the impact of impairment and integration and restructuring charges.
We will post the prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website until July 21, 2016.
During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainty. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, we will share the results of the final quarter of the year and our optimism for the year ahead.
We delivered $22.2 billion in revenue this quarter and $93.6 billion total revenue for the fiscal year 2015, an increase of 8% year over year. We pushed forward in our transformation by focusing our investment in areas where we have differentiation and significant opportunity for future growth in large addressable markets. We galvanized around our mission and ambitions. We aligned our structure to deliver better products at a more rapid pace. We focused our advertising business on search. We focused our mapping efforts on higher-level experiences and development services. We restructured our phone portfolio so that we can operate more efficiently near term while driving reinvention long term. We invested more in new mobile applications like Wunderlist, Acompli, and Sunrise. We also strengthened our enterprise cloud platform by acquiring Revolution Analytics, Datazen, and BlueStripe in this quarter alone. And we are at the threshold of the Windows 10 launch.
I'm proud of these steps and I'm proud of the results we delivered in tandem. In cloud alone, our annualized commercial cloud run rate surpassed $8 billion this quarter, and the revenue grew 88% year over year. We are on a strong trajectory towards our goal of $20 billion in fiscal year 2018.
With that as the backdrop, I want to walk you through the progress we are making in each one of our three ambitions. Let me start with reinventing productivity in business processes, including our efforts across Office 365 and Dynamics. We continue to see strong demand for Office 365 and Dynamics products. We now have more than 15 million Office 365 consumer subscribers, and customers are signing up at a pace of nearly 1 million per month. In addition, we surpassed 150 million downloads of Office Mobile on iOS and Android and have introduced a new version of Office for the Mac.
In the commercial space, the number of Office 365 users continues to climb, with seats growing 74% year over year. Office 365 now is in four out of five Fortune 500 enterprises, and more than 55% of the installed base is on premium workloads. It is clear that we have success moving customers to the cloud, given half of all the enterprise agreement renewals were for Office 365 this quarter.
Small and medium businesses offer one of our best opportunities for new growth in the cloud. In fact, for more than a year now, we have seen 50,000 new SMB customers adopt Office 365 every month.
Last week at our Worldwide Partner Conference, we announced our new Office 365 Premium SKU for business, E5. Now our customers will get rich new voice functionality in Skype for Business with Cloud PBX and PSTN Conferencing, deep analytics with Delve analytics and Power BI Pro, and advanced security features such as lockbox and advanced threat protection. With E5, we have expanded our market opportunity for Office 365 by more than $50 billion. This new E5 SKU and the launch of Office 2016 will drive one of the biggest new businesses for us.
Let's now turn to CRM. This market alone is $20 billion-plus and has massive opportunity for reinvention. Mainstreaming Dynamics into our engineering sales and marketing efforts gives us the ability to participate in this large and growing market in a more meaningful way.
Last week we announced the acquisition of FieldOne, which helps strengthen our Dynamics CRM customer service offering. This quarter, total paid seats for Dynamics CRM online increased 140% year over year, and we have more than 8 million paid Dynamics seats across CRM and ERP in total, up 25% year over year. This creates a great foundation for future growth in our Dynamics business.
Next, I want to share our progress in building the intelligent cloud platform with Azure. Again this quarter, we have seen proof that preference for our cloud staff services creates a flywheel of growth for our cloud platform services. In Azure, both revenue and compute usage increased by triple digits year over year. We tripled our revenue from Azure premium services this quarter. In the enterprise mobility services, we now have 17,000 customers.
Appeal for Visual Studio Tools has grown to include developers beyond our traditional base with some of the decisions we made to embrace open source with .Net and support across platform development. Since November, we have seen more than 5 million downloads of Visual Studio Community, the fastest ever adoption of a Visual Studio product. Visual Studio Online continues to gain momentum, with over 3.1 million registered users.
Business intelligence and analytics is another large, rapidly growing market for us with an opportunity of more than $15 billion. We are focused on strengthening our offers in this space. Just last week we announced the availability of Cortana Analytics Suite, our fully-managed big data and advanced analytics solution. We're not only building the tools but are also delivering the insights customers need to transform their businesses.
Security is a key priority for our enterprise customers and another $30 billion market opportunity for us, and we are building capability to meet customers' need. For example, we've made significant investments in security with Azure Key Vault, enabling customers to protect data in the cloud with secure key management and encryption customers can control. We have four new certifications for Azure, bringing our certification and at the station total to 22 globally, more than any other cloud platform today.
Our third bold ambition is to create more personal computing experiences with Windows and our devices. I am thrilled we are just days away from the start of Windows 10. It's the first step towards our goal of 1 billion Windows 10 active devices in the fiscal year 2018. Our aspiration with Windows 10 is to move people from meeting to choosing to loving Windows. Based on feedback from more than 5 million people who have been using Windows 10, we believe people will love the familiarity of Windows 10 and the innovation. It's safe, secure, and always up to date. Windows 10 is more personal and more productive with Cortana, Office, universal apps, and Continuum. And Windows 10 will deliver innovative new experiences like Inking on Microsoft Edge and gaming across Xbox and PCs, and also opens up entirely new device categories such as Hololens.
Windows 10 will deliver significant value to enterprise customers as well. Windows 10 provides advanced security capabilities with additional features for hardware-based security, mobile work and data protection. It also provides a single device management platform across all devices, from phones to laptops to Internet of Things devices. And Windows 10 helps enterprises stay up to date with Windows Update for Business and Windows Store for Business.
While the PC ecosystem has been under pressure recently, I do believe that Windows 10 will broaden our economic opportunity and return Windows to growth. First, we have an OEM ecosystem that is creating exciting new hardware designs for Windows 10. In fact, our OEM partners have over 2,000 distinct devices or configurations already in testing for Windows 10 upgrades as well as hundreds of new hardware designs. We are delighted that the first of these exciting new devices will start to be available on Windows 10 launch day, and by this holiday we will be selling the widest range of Windows hardware ever available.
Second, we will generate new growth through gross margin on our own differentiated first-party premium device portfolio. We will also significantly reduce our losses on the phone by operating more effectively and efficiently with a more focused portfolio.
Third, we will grow monetization opportunities across the commercial and consumer space. In the enterprise, customers will continue to value our unparalleled management security, app dev, and servicing capability. And for consumers, Windows 10 creates monetization opportunities with store, search, and gaming. We are confident that these are the right levers to revitalize Windows and restore growth. The progress we made this quarter and the forward-looking guidance that Amy will share shows the opportunity for renewed growth is real.
In hardware, both Surface and Xbox had an incredible Q4. We more than doubled Surface revenue to nearly $900 million this quarter, capping off a year in which it delivered more than $3.6 billion in revenue. Both consumers and enterprise customers love this device. Surface is clearly a product where we have gotten the formula right, earned fans, and can apply this formula to other parts of the hardware portfolio.
Gaming is an important scenario for Windows 10, and our success with Xbox this quarter gives us a strong starting position heading into launch. Xbox Live users grew 22% this quarter and logged nearly 3.5 billion hours of gameplay. Our growing fan base is excited for the best games lineup in our history. All of this comes together with Windows 10, when fans can connect with each other, stream all of their Xbox One games to Windows 10, and experience the best virtual reality platform given our partnership with Oculus Rift and Valve.
In search, Bing will now power both differentiated experiences on Windows 10 such as Cortana as well as search and search advertising across the AOL portfolio sites in addition to the partnership we already have with Yahoo!, Amazon, and Apple. With advertising revenue growth of 21% year over year, Bing will transition to profitability in the coming fiscal year.
It's been a strong year of progress. Above all else, I'm optimistic about our future. Our cloud services are accelerating fast, and Windows is positioned for renewed growth.
With that, I'll hand it over to Amy to talk about this quarter's results in more detail. I look forward to rejoining you after that for questions. Thank you.
Amy Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks and good afternoon, everyone.
Our fourth quarter results demonstrate the strong progress that we've made as a company over the past year. Key strategic initiatives such as cloud, first-party hardware, and consumer services delivered significant growth as well as improved profitability.
Commercial customer renewals remained healthy with strong adoption of cloud services and a higher mix of annuity than we expected. And our disciplined approach to resource allocation has allowed us to increase investment in the growth initiatives Satya mentioned while reducing the company's operating expenses. This allows us to better compete in markets with structural growth where we feel we have unique competitive advantages. With that said, I will start with an overview of our financial performance before moving into a more detailed discussion of the results.
This quarter we recorded an impairment charge related to our phone hardware business and incurred integration and restructuring expenses. Additionally, like most multinational companies, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar continues to have a significant impact on our reported results. Accordingly, when applicable, I'll give results and growth rates adjusting for the impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses, but also in constant currency to help you better understand the underlying business fundamentals.
Revenue was $22.2 billion, down 5% and down 2% in constant currency. As a reminder, last year included $382 million of revenue that we recognized at the conclusion of our commercial agreement with Nokia. Significant gross margin improvement across commercial cloud, Surface, and our consumer services helped to mitigate the impact on gross margin from the decline in D&C licensing. Total gross margin declined 7% and 3% in constant currency. Operating income declined 3% and 1% in constant currency. Earnings per share were $0.62, growth of 11% and growth of 8% in constant currency. Unearned revenue grew 1% to $25.3 billion and 7% in constant currency. Commercial unearned was better than expected, as we saw a higher mix of annuity in the quarter.
From a geographic perspective, the majority of markets performed in line with our expectations. The notable exception was Brazil, where inflation and macroeconomic volatility weighed on our performance. Overall, macro conditions remain a challenge in some large opportunity markets like China, Russia, Japan, and Brazil. There was slightly less impact from currency than our expectation.
With that backdrop, I'll move to a detailed discussion of our results. Q4 last year effectively marked the end of the XP refresh cycle. It impacted our Windows OEM and non-annuity volume licensing as well as our Office non-annuity volume licensing results. During that time, OEM revenue exceeded that of the underlying PC market, driven by a higher attach of Pro, particularly within the developed markets. This quarter Pro declined by roughly 21%. And similar to last quarter, we saw Pro attach remain at pre-XP levels, even with the underlying softness in the business PC market.
The annuity portion of Windows licensing grew again on a constant currency basis, with non- annuity revenue declining due to XP. Windows non-Pro revenue declined 27%, as OEMs tightly managed PC inventory ahead of the Windows 10 launch, particularly in developed markets. In our view, this is a healthy state for the channel as we head into a transformational launch that starts next week.
Consumer Office 365 had another strong quarter of net subscriber growth. Overall, consumer Office revenue results reflected the decline in the underlying driver of that business, developed market consumer PC sales. Within D&C licensing, the transition to Office 365 accounted for 13 points, and the impact of Japan's PC market accounted for another 19 points.
We had another impressive quarter in search, with revenue growth of 21% and 25% in constant currency, driven by increases in both volume and revenue per search.
As Satya said, revenue from Surface more than doubled this quarter, with continued strength of Surface Pro 3 and the launch of Surface 3. Enterprise sales accelerated this quarter, and sales of Surface 3 were particularly strong to educational customers. Our differentiated products as well as improved discipline and execution helped to improve gross margins by $450 million this quarter and $1.3 billion in fiscal 2015.
Within Xbox, strong growth in consoles, online transactions, and first-party games helped to drive revenue growth of 27%. This progress as well as the excitement we generated at E3 with Xbox exclusive gaming content and backwards compatibility demonstrates the building momentum that exists within the Xbox ecosystem.
In phones, we sold 8.4 million Lumias, which is an increase over last year's full-quarter sales. ASPs, however, have continued to decline. Gross margin declined this quarter, driven by lower per unit margins on Lumia devices as well as reduced volumes in non-Lumia phones.
As announced on July 8, we are changing our approach in this business and are focused on delivering differentiated experiences for our targeted customer segments while improving our operating results.
Moving to our commercial results, total revenue across our two segments grew slightly in USD and 4% in constant currency. Our contracted-not-billed balance, which is a key indicator of customer commitment, reached an all-time high of over $24.5 billion, and it reached this level even with the significant appreciation in the U.S. dollar. Constant currency bookings were flat to the prior year, though as a reminder, last year commercial bookings grew 23% on the strength of a large renewal base as well as the end of XP, discussed earlier.
Our Office commercial business continues to transition to Office 365. We again grew the installed seat base for Office, Exchange, SharePoint, and Skype for Business. Office 365 allows us to have a deeper ongoing relationship with all of our customers, which in turn provides us with the opportunity to expand and grow our business over time. Because of this transition as well as weakness in Japan and the impact of XP, Office commercial products and services grew 1% in constant currency, quite similar to Q3.
Dynamics revenue grew 15% on a constant currency basis, driven by the strong CRM results Satya talked about and our ERP business, which saw 35% growth in customers this quarter.
Server products and services grew 4% and 9% in constant currency, continuing to outperform our peers in the enterprise software sector. SQL Server share growth continued, as customers value its high performance and lower cost of ownership. Revenue and licenses of Windows Server grew against the backdrop of a declining server hardware market; and in the public cloud space, yet another quarter of significant Azure usage growth. Additionally, we significantly grew the gross margin percentage in our commercial other segment, increasing 13 points to over 43%.
Moving to operating expenses, which declined 9% or 4% in constant currency, our continued disciplined approach has allowed us to incrementally fund strategic initiatives without having to increase our expense base.
Other income was favorable to our expectations, driven by gains on foreign currency and sales of investments.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24% and was at the high end of our guided range, due in part to strong performance in our computing and gaming hardware segment in the U.S.
We returned $6.7 billion to shareholders this quarter, nearly double the amount from last year.
With that overview of the current quarter, let me turn to our outlook, starting with a few overall comments. As has been communicated over the past couple of months, the accounting for Windows 10 will change. We will be deferring a portion of Windows 10 revenue, primarily OEM, and recognizing it over time, generally two to four years. As shared previously, the initial deferral and the subsequent recognition of those deferrals will be netted in Corporate and Other in our segment reporting. Most importantly, underlying billings and cash flow won't change. Therefore, our commentary in this and subsequent earnings calls, including our guidance, will focus on results prior to the net deferral impact, which we believe is the best reflection of business health.
With that background, let me share some thoughts on fiscal 2016. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar will continue to have a significant impact on results over the course of FY 2016, assuming rates across our largest currencies, the euro, Japanese yen, and the British pound, stay in line with current rates, and that the geographic mix of revenue stays as forecasted. In our non-annuity businesses, the impact is immediate as the revenue is recognized in quarter. In our annuity business, revenue is deferred and the impact is delayed as we earn the revenue off the balance sheet.
In total, we expect FX will negatively impact total revenue growth by five points in each quarter of H1, with seven points of negative impact in our commercial segments. H1 would be the peak of the FX headwinds. And in H2, we expect FX to have three points of negative impact in total and roughly four points of negative impact on our commercial revenue. With Windows 10, we expect momentum to build throughout the year, as we and our partners bring new devices, applications, and services to market. We expect this to benefit our business results in the second half of the fiscal year.
With the strength in Xbox and Xbox Live along with the launch of Halo 5 in October, Xbox will continue to grow both fans and profitability.
With the recently announced changes in phone, there will be significant revenue declines year over year in the phone segment each quarter. With the proactive measures we've taken to reduce our cost structure, overall losses will also decline for the fiscal year. We would expect the majority of that improvement in the second half of the year once the restructuring efforts are materially complete. Bing will be profitable in FY 2016. And assuming the macro environment is stable, we expect that our commercial momentum will continue, highlighted by growth in our commercial cloud. We remain on track to achieve our $20 billion commercial cloud ambition in fiscal 2018.
We now expect operating expenses to be $32.1 billion to $32.4 billion, which is lower than the guidance we provided in April. The lower guidance reflects the savings from our restructuring of the phone business as well as important investments to drive top line growth as we support Windows 10, our first-party hardware efforts, as well as sales head count to accelerate our leadership position in the commercial cloud. We expect our full-year tax rate to be 24% plus or minus one point, excluding the net impact from the Windows 10 deferral.
Now to Q1, starting with Devices and Consumer. In licensing we expect revenue to be $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion. This range reflects Windows revenue roughly in line with the PC market. Within Consumer Office, we expect to transition to Office 365 subscriptions to continue. In computing and gaming hardware, we expect revenues to be $2.0 billion to $2.1 billion. As a reminder, we launched Surface Pro 3 in late June last year, with launch benefits extending into Q1. As far as hardware, we expect revenue to be approximately $900 million, reflecting our change in approach. We expect gross margin in phone to improve sequentially in Q1. In devices and consumer other, we expect revenue to be $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion, with continued growth in Bing, Consumer Office 365, and Xbox Live transactions.
And in commercial, as I discussed previously, we expect a significant FX headwind this quarter. Our constant currency growth is expected to be about 7% in Q1, which assumes we continue to take share in key markets and build momentum in the new areas we have entered. With the negative impact of FX, we expect revenue to be roughly flat.
On commercial licensing, we expect revenue of $9.1 billion to $9.2 billion, with a continued shift to annuity; and in commercial other, with the significant growth in our cloud revenue of $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion.
We expect COGS to be $7.0 billion $7.2 billion, with the variability being driven by the hardware segment. We expect operating expenses to be $7.6 billion to $7.7 billion. As a reminder, other income and expense includes dividend and interest income offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging. Given the current FX environment, we expect our net cost of hedging to increase and other income and expense to be negative $200 million.
Excluding the Windows 10 deferral and the impact of foreign currency, we expect the sequential decline in unearned to be slightly better than historic seasonality, driven by the growing mix of annuity revenue.
In closing, I'm proud of the tremendous amount of progress that our company has made over the past year. We've improved how we operate in virtually every sense. These changes have allowed us to aggressively invest in areas that will drive future growth for the company. I'm looking forward for a better position to capitalize on the significant opportunities ahead of us.
With that, let me turn it back over to Chris for the Q&A.

Thank you. Our first question comes from Phil Winslow from Credit Suisse.
Philip Alan Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Thanks, guys, and congrats on a great quarter. I just wanted to double-click on Office 365. You guys showed another huge quarter of growth in terms of your consumer seat count, and I think it was 86% growth on the commercial other side for Office 365. I'm wondering if you could just drill into both the consumer and then enterprise side, just the trends you're seeing there. And obviously the guidance you all just provided, it looks like you expect those trends to continue in Q1, so any color there would be great.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Yes, I'll take that. Overall, we are very excited about the growth we are seeing in Office 365. On the consumer side, as you noted, we are growing 1 million subs a month, and that's fantastic growth for us. The consumer value, especially now that we have even all the endpoints covered with Office, the definition of Office and where all it's present is also changed, and that all accrues to consumers being willing to have a subscription relationship with us.
On the enterprise side, the growth remains very exciting for us, and the growth comes in multiple forms. It comes in the form of just the EAs renewing more to Office 365. It also comes in the form of some of the more comprehensive suites, the E3 and the new E5. That's the commitment we are seeing. And we also see small businesses. I talked about the 50,000 businesses, small and medium-sized businesses each month signing up for Office 365. That's pretty unprecedented. Having been in the server business all my life, I've never seen a lot of the small business customers adopt some of the rich capabilities like it's possible now, and that's great growth as well. And that cloud revenue number that is the 88% is all up cloud revenues inclusive of Office 365, EMS, and Azure. And it's good to see that kind of growth at that kind of scale now with $8 billion.
Amy Hood - Microsoft Corp.
One thing I would add, Phil, to that is an important dynamic that we're seeing in Office 365. As we are having this momentum build, in fact we talked about some of the new customers we're adding, and the way we see that is the install base growing. And we were able to see that this quarter across all the core workloads in Office. And when you think about why that's so critical long term, it's our ability to sell some of the workloads Satya actually referenced that will be in E5 when it launches. They have the capability of upgrading on a more consistent basis using more of these premium services. So when you can both add to your install base and add overall market opportunity, we do feel good about our line of sight in that business for our long-term goals.
Philip Alan Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Great. Thanks, guys, and congrats again.

Our next question comes from Brent Thill from UBS.
Brent J. Thill - UBS Securities LLC
Good afternoon. Satya, the server business continues a steady outperformance and, as Amy pointed out, better growth than your peers. I guess a couple questions as it relates to the Windows 2003 retirement and any impact you're seeing there. And then secondarily, if you could, just comment on some of the new product launches. It seems like there's a stack of new solutions that are coming on the server side that look pretty exciting. Your partners are excited about it. If you could highlight what you see as the most interesting from your perspective over the next several quarters. Thank you.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Overall, I'd start even with the bold view that my server business is not a legacy business. We fundamentally think about servers as the extension of the cloud. I even describe it architecturally as the edge of our cloud. Every server, for example, has things like disaster recovery, backup, and tier-ing with the cloud. And so we will continue to push that differentiation because I think that view architecturally and the delivery of it is what makes us pretty unique. And you see it in the numbers. Our servers even this quarter grew 9%. And compared to the industry peers, we're obviously gaining share with Windows Server, on SQL Server, and pretty much all of our management and security products as well.
And going forward, we have a fantastic lineup of servers, not just the infrastructure, but even SharePoint, Exchange, Lync Server continues to have significant on-premise deployment. So as our cloud continues to grow, obviously, we are getting where there is more capability in the cloud. We're incenting customers and our partners to move to the cloud. But at the same time, we are going to have a great server wave. I'm excited about our SQL product. I think it goes into the first preview next – in fact, tomorrow. And that product I think is a pretty revolutionary product because for the first time you can take a single table in a database and you would tier it with the cloud, and that kind of capability only we can provide, and that's something that I'm looking forward to.
Amy Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And, Brent, to your specific question on Windows Server 2003, we did have a good quarter, as we talked about, in Windows Server. But in general, that business, unlike the quiet upgrades that we see, just because so much of the business is already on annuity, you don't see that type of incremental impact in an in-quarter release. That isn't to say there isn't ample opportunity for us to make sure we upgrade customers to the higher-value product and more secure and more manageable offerings we have in the server business.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Brent. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.

Our next question comes from Mark Moerdler from Bernstein Research.
Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Thank you, nice quarter. I want to drill in, in terms of the move to the cloud. This quarter the year-over-year server product and services revenue growth was slower than it was in the past quarters. How much of that is because you're seeing now some revenue shift to Azure, or is it not yet seeing any revenue shift going? And then I have a follow-up question.
Amy Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Why don't I take that one, and we'll see what Mark's follow-up is? At 9% growth and continuing to take share, I feel like our performance in this continues to be a positive outlier to the peer group. And for me, that type of performance in double digits for the year, I still feel quite good about.
In general, what's interesting I think is you're getting to the crux of it is do we have incremental workloads that are unique to the cloud. We continue to see that. The very best example, frankly, as Satya mentioned in his comments, which is our EMS performance, Enterprise Mobility Suite offerings. It's taking something that's very unique, builds off of our core in the server business, and allows us to both grow and add new perspective there. So I don't think of it as reflecting a bigger shift than we've seen in particular this quarter. Also, if you'll remember, a year ago we had a very big base of expirations in Q4 and had very strong performance a year ago. So I don't look at it as a direct trend line.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
The only thing I'll add is when I look at the total growth of Azure, the growth that's coming now from some of the premium services, these are businesses that we actually did not ever participate on premise at all. Even EMS, when I think about our management, our management was just about Windows management. But we now have management data protection and identity systems that cross all devices in the enterprise, including the Internet of Things, and that makes it pretty exciting. And that growth is great to see.
Same thing on server management, we have a new suite called the Operations Management Suite, which also spans all the cloud units as well as on-premise units. Cortana Analytics, we never participated in any of the advanced analytics workloads at all in spite of all the success we had in the database business. So I'm excited about built new workloads that in many cases are born in the cloud workloads where we are expanding our market opportunity and continuing to outperform our peers and grab share when it comes to on-premise.
Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
That's very helpful. Switching gears a bit, on Windows, obviously you're seeing some amount of delay due to Windows 10 on the OEM side. Can you give maybe a little more higher color in terms of how you're thinking about that, how big a delay is it, how much we could see that starting to be replaced next quarter and beyond?
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
I'll take that and, Amy, you can add to it. The way the Windows ecosystem works is there are phases to it. And in fact, if anything, this release of Windows 10, just the way we have built it with the Insider program, everything is of course speeding up because in some sense we've taken a very different approach with this Windows-as-a-service even when it comes to OEM relations and how they're able to co-create the products with us.
But that said, there are three distinct phases. The first phase is what I will describe as the upgrade phase. That's what starts in a week's time, and that is a more retail execution and upgrade. Then come the fall, you will see the devices from all the OEMs going into the holiday quarter. And then the enterprise upgrades; in fact, we have a release of enterprise features, which I mentioned in my script, which will ship in that timeframe. And I expect piloting to start and deployments to start in the second half of the fiscal year. So that's how I would think about the OEM as well as enterprise adoption. So my bullishness for Windows 10 is more in the second half of the fiscal year, and of course it will build. It will build starting in a week's time in retail and in the upgrades, but I see this in three phases.
Amy Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And to your specific question, Mark, before every launch we tend to have a tightening in the channel as they prepare and run reasonably lean. This is a healthy state. It's within the range of normal. So I don't think of it as a delay in the way you're talking about it. It is pretty standard in fact, as Satya talked about, in terms of the dynamic. And he mentioned we are feeling I think a lot of excitement from the ecosystem about what's possible with some of the new devices that will come. And so I don't really think of it in that way. I think about it as an encouragement that they want to fill the channel as quickly as they can over the coming quarters with new machines.
Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC

Our next question comes from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley.
Keith E. Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Excellent, nice quarter, guys, and thank you for taking the question. I wanted to drill into the new strategy around the phone business a little bit. The revenue expectation for Q1 I think was below our expectations and I think a point below what the Street was looking for. Can you give us a sense of how you see that business trending over a longer period of time? Because there is a significant restructuring going on and I think – I would think a lot of guys have a good view in their head of what your expectation is for this business on a revenue run rate basis? Or what do you expect to be selling this year on a going forward basis is right now?
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Let me start and then, Amy, you can add to this. The big shift that we are making when it comes to phones is to not think about phones in isolation. That's perhaps the biggest shift because I think about Windows 10 in its entirety, the Windows ecosystem in its entirety. We clearly are going to have premium first-party portfolio, and you've seen some of the numbers, some of the progress we have made in Surface. I feel that we have a formula there that I would like to apply more broadly in terms of growing, just delivering innovation, growing our own economic return for it, stimulating demand, creating categories. All of that is what I want to do broadly. And it applies to phones, it applies to Surface hardware, it applies to Hololens, and that's how I view it.
I believe our participation in the phone segment by itself with Windows phones and Lumia phones being there is important, and that's why we picked the three areas where we have differentiation and we want to focus on it. We're going to have great flagship phones for Windows 10. That's actually a segment we don't today have good devices, and we hope to change that with Windows 10. We have in fact good traction in the business segment. This is business customers who are actually buying phone devices, which is basically a radio with essentially a smartphone to be able to deploy their line-of-business applications. That's where we have pretty unparalleled value, which is we have Visual Studio Online and some of the tools I talked about, so you can generate these apps at a low cost of ownership, manage them, secure them, and deploy them to our phone endpoints, and then of course, management and security. So that's a place where we want to continue to focus.
And in the value smartphones, that's the place where I want us to be much more efficient. We clearly have some value to add there because of the uniqueness of Office and Skype and our services. But at the same time, I think we want to be smart about how many of these phones do we want to generate, how many, which price points we want to participate. That's where you will see the most significant operational changes from how we operated last year to the coming year.
Amy Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And so, Keith, the way that I think about it and I tried to outline it in my comments is that the significant revenue declines quarter over quarter through the year are a reflection of the focused approach we're going to take in phone. It's an approach that we've executed in other hardware segments that I feel is a proven model for us. Our profitability will also improve. More of that comes in the second half of the year structurally as we complete some of the restructuring efforts and those costs come out of our operating expense run rate. But I think that's probably the way to more appropriately think about over time you expect to see gross margin improvement and operating profit improvement as opposed to focusing on the revenue line.
Keith E. Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And if I could sneak one more in just on the security side of the business, I think a lot of guys have thought traditionally about security as something that Microsoft does to make their platform more secure, and it does provide more confidence in users using your platforms and your tools. On a going-forward basis, is there more of an opportunity for you guys to sell security as more of a standalone opportunity? It's something that's in very high demand today with those looking for more secure solutions. Is that something that could potentially be more of a standalone opportunity for Microsoft on a go-forward basis?
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
In fact, we are adding significant value in security. It's much better for us, for example, to add capabilities. There are no (46:55) 365 in security, and that's all in, for example, this new suite that we have just announced called E5, the secure lock box. That's actually a pretty – a very cool set of features that allow both regulators and businesses to have, for example, audit ability and control over their movement in the cloud. Similarly Azure, where we launched a whole set of security offers around how people can encrypt and manage keys. So those are all security features. We bought a company in Colorado that's essentially a firewall on all your identity management.
So when we talk about enterprise management suite growth, a lot of it is just obviously is management growth, but it's also security and data protection growth. So the approach we're taking is we are essentially creating, to your point, security value around our products, which allows us to participate in essentially a security market that we never did in the ways that we are. So it's more than just launching one point security product. It's much more broadly participating in the security market, and you have seen some of that in the inorganic moves and the suites we have created.
Keith E. Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard from Citi.
Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Hi. Amy, just for you on the annuity, it looks like annuity was about 82% of the commercial revenue for the last two quarters. How high do you think that goes? It sounds like you do expect that to continue to go up, although it probably never gets to 100%.
Amy Hood - Microsoft Corp.
I do think over the long term you're right. That is how I think about it. And frankly, inherent in the conversation around moving to the cloud with the aggressive targets we've given, that is implied, to your point. And so I think 100% is not the logical answer. There will always be somebody who chooses to purchase on a one-time basis, or there's a logic to it. But I do think over time, we do expect that to trend in that general direction.
Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
And then, Satya, you mentioned CRM in your comments, your prepared comments, which we haven't really heard you talk that much about as an area of interest in the past. I'm wondering. What changed in your view, or how do you look to bring that into it sounds like more the core productivity scenario that you deliver?
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Overall, business process collaborations, communications, these category boundaries are things that I believe are going to change. I've always felt that in some sense, most of the time we even automate business processes, but we spend really getting our business done in our communication and collaboration tools. And this impedance is something that I've always dreamt of how do we go forward. And CRM has taken our own Dynamics product, has taken some pretty unique approaches. And quite frankly, I was the one who opened up our communications and collaborations for other CRM vendors.
One of the things that I'm very explicit about is we will have an open platform for other business process applications because it's a very fragmented market the world over, especially if you add SMB. And so we want to be having a platform play as well as our own business applications play, and both of them should be high-growth for us. And in the last year, we just added more focus and we put more selling capacity around it, more marketing capacity, and now for the mainstream that's across Microsoft because I'm a big believer in this because I think we have something unique to add. As opposed to driving our own top line/bottom line growth, I think we can bring real innovation, and that's what is exciting to see.
And it's not just CRM. I'm actually excited about our ERP business. Some of the numbers that Amy talked about is growth in the seats. And when I think about data as the new currency, we have lots of managed seats and a lot of data which all will move to the cloud. And so things like Power BI and Cortana Analytics can help customers transform. So in fact, that's one of the reasons why we have been very optimistic about some of our new data capabilities because we have the attach capability go out even in the install base of Dynamics.
Amy Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And, Walter, just quickly, this is one of the areas that we have invested in actually leading into this past fiscal year, FY 2015. And the results have actually been better than we anticipated when we first made the investment. So I think we both feel very good about the momentum that's built through the year.

Our next question comes from Karl Keirstead from Deutsche Bank.
Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hi, thanks, a question for Amy on the cost control front. It looks like you once again came in below your OpEx guide, but I think the COGS number came a little bit above what you had guided to three months ago, and I'm just wondering if you could talk through that. Obviously, it affects everybody's gross margin calculations. Was it the hardware mix shift? Was it the challenges with the phone business? Perhaps a little color there might help us. Thank you.
Amy Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Sure, Karl. Because of the performance in Xbox and in Surface, you're right, it is a hardware mix shift a bit. We outperformed significantly in both those products in Q4, and that took us a little bit outside the COGS range but not as much as our revenue outperformed. So actually, margins structurally were better than I thought they would be. And so I actually feel quite good with that outperformance and our ability to see that outperformance fall to the bottom line through stronger executional gross margin percentage, particularly in that segment.
Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.

Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays.
Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to go back to Azure. You obviously have strong momentum there. Can you talk a little bit about the use cases you see from the enterprise and SMB customers? Is this very much a test and development situation, or are you thinking of broader adoption there as defined by obviously Office 365, et cetera? Thank you.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
At this point, I would say it's pretty broad even use cases for even enterprise customers. There's definitely dev/test happening. There is production IaaS infrastructure-as-a-service deployment given some of the new high-performance SKUs and storage options that we have. And we've seen significant adoption of SQL, so this is Azure DB, machine learning-as-a-service. One of the things that we realize is as every company out there becomes a software company, beyond even our traditional reach through IT, everyone has a digital office inside the company. They are, in fact, doing things in advanced analytics and using machine learning, and that's a place where we have some very unique capabilities. So that's another place where we're seeing wide adoption.
We are seeing adoption in the building of new front ends, back ends for new front ends, so essentially using Azure as the cloud back end for their mobile apps across Android, iOS, and Windows as well as their web. That's another use case that's high growth for us. And of course, Cortana Analytics; this is the big data side of it. This is happening in IT. It's happening, as I said, in digital offices within each one of the customers. So we have a pretty broad spectrum of use cases. And some of the customers have talked about it in their recent set of conferences, from our Partner Conference to our Ignite Conference. We have been in fact showcasing; even our ad campaign showcases some of these use cases.

Our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.
Heather A. Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great, thank you. I just had two questions, pretty quick ones. Just to follow up on Azure, I was wondering if you could share with us what you're seeing in the mix between IaaS and PaaS and how you've seen that shift evolve over the last few quarters.
And then secondly, just to follow up I think on Walter's question, yes, you've definitely been focusing on the customer relationship management opportunity and the financials market more. But given the big SaaS incumbent already competing in that area, can you share with us? Do you think you have the assets you need internally to execute against your long-term goals?

Sure. On the IaaS with the SaaS, it's an interesting question. I've not looked at it in isolation, because what happens is at least the use cases, what starts off as IaaS suddenly will start using Azure AD for identity management, will use a little bit of our media services, for example, just doing content and encoding. So there's a mix always. So there's nothing pure PaaS, nothing pure IaaS. That's the trend I see, but it's a split that we should go take a look at and then offline maybe even talk about it. But overall, we see significant amount of IaaS in the last year, because that's probably the place where we had more of a weakness which we have now overcome. And so we're seeing significant growth of IaaS in the enterprise. But the place where we continue to have significant differentiation is in some of these managed services and PaaS. And that I think is the mix on it.
And then on the Dynamics side, I absolutely believe we have a huge opportunity. Having worked in business applications for a long time, first of all, the market is very fragmented. I think people like to talk about leaders, and there are clearly leaders when you go to the very top of the enterprise customers and segments. But the way the market splits into verticals and into horizontals and then the platform affects it, there's plenty of opportunity. For sure, you've got to be one of the players. It will be three players, four players, whatever, but in every technology paradigm, you want to be one of them. We already have a $2 billion-plus Dynamics business. I talked about the total number of seats. And now we have this triple-digit CRM online growth. So I feel that we are in a good position. And I feel that things – we'll look at and even some of the inorganic means to keep growing it. In fact, the field service acquisition I talked about in my script is an example of that. So that's my bullishness on our business process prospects.

Our next question comes from Ross MacMillan from RBC Capital Markets.
Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks for taking my question. First on OpEx, the guidance, Amy, is impressive. I presume that fully accommodates the restructuring announced two weeks ago. And then last year, you said core Microsoft ex-NBS would be down slightly in OpEx. I wondered if you could provide a similar comment for fiscal 2016 for core Microsoft ex-phone.
Amy Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Sure. Look, I talked a little bit about it, but let me go into a bit of detail on that. I think the first half of your question was does the $32.1 billion to $32.4 billion full-year OpEx guide reflect the timing of the implementation of our restructuring, and it certainly does. And so what you can then see, relating to the second half your question, is that we are taking some of those savings and investing them back into the business in some of these key growth areas we've seen. I outlined three on the call. The third one I probably could have expanded more on.
The first one is Windows 10. The second is the first-party hardware, where we just had such terrific performance again this Q4. And then finally, the third bucket was about accelerating our commercial cloud lead. And I do feel like in that area, we could invest in Office 365 some of the new E5 capabilities and look forward to adding sales capacity to take advantage of that. We'll also add sales capacity across some of the other opportunities we've seen broadly. And so I look and see that as an opportunity to accelerate top line growth.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
And one thing I would just add because a lot of folks even ask about our business process and business applications, I want to build a long-term profitable business. In other words, one of the keys in business apps is you can always get into the trap of overspending in sales and marketing and not having long-term leverage at all. One of the things I feel very good about our position is how do you really build a long-term profitable business; that's front and center to me. So we will not overspend there in sales and marketing because we do believe the products – in fact, there is a different way to sell even business process applications because of the cloud, and that's something that we want to take advantage of.
Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC
And I had have one quick follow-up, if I could. That's helpful. At Analyst Day you did talk about – I think it was 8% unit growth in the Office ecosystem over the last three years. And it sounds like you continued to see nice unit growth in Office. How should we think about that going forward? Are you fully expecting to continue to see unit growth?
And then also just a clarification, I think your customer lifetime value was based on existing SKUs. So as you introduce E5 and others, does that open up the potential for even higher customer lifetime value? Thanks.
Amy Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Great. I do think the work we showed at the analyst meeting on the importance of increasing the install base across Office and Exchange, that it did occur again this quarter. So I feel good that we're staying on the trajectory that we showed in the projections. I do continue to expect that to happen, as we shared back that last week in April.
On the second half of your question, I tend to think you're right. Generically, each of the examples was quite different. There were people that were upgrading from X to Y. There were people that were just simply moving to the cloud. But one of the things that the cloud, to your point, makes fundamentally possible is the opportunity for us to quickly iterate the opportunity's billed value and deploy it more quickly to customers. Generally, I do think that they will pay us for that, to your specific question. I also think the importance of it is that it tends to also come with higher margin. So our improvement and continued improvement in our commercial cloud gross margin portfolio, I think this is a key criteria of that. So I associate it, yes, with lifetime value, and I also associate it with our ability to move our gross margin percentage up.
Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC
That's great, thank you.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Ross. We have time for one last question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our last question comes from Daniel Ives with FBR Capital.
Daniel H. Ives - FBR Capital Markets & Co.
Thanks, just one last one just on M&A. Maybe you could just talk through the change in the strategy. Obviously, given what's happened with the Nokia write-down, the security acquisition going to Pivotal-Cisco year, how you're thinking about M&A in the scheme of everything, especially as you guys have been pretty tight on cost controls and everything else. Thanks.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Overall, again, the way I look at it is, first of all I'm most focused on obviously our organic growth. And in there, Amy alluded to this. We've made significant changes in how we've allocated our own organic dollars, both in R&D as well as in sales and marketing. And we'll continue to do that because I think there are significant new opportunities for us to go after, and that will require us to reallocate aggressively, and that to me is core. But beyond that, we will look at inorganic means. When I look at all the acquisitions that we have made over the course of last year and our OpEx guidance for next year shows how disciplined we are in bringing new talent in, be it in R&D, be it in sales and marketing.
So we are not afraid to bring in new capability, but then also questioning what is the allocation we have. Of course, we have done smaller acquisitions, but they add up. They're pretty significant when you add up all the things that we have done in the Office 365 space, all of the things that we have done in the Azure space. So we'll continue to do that. And if anything comes up in M&A which allows us to pursue our strategic vision that we will need to even allocate more to on an OpEx basis, post-acquisition we will look at that. So I won't shy away from it because what's important to us is growth in areas where we have something unique to contribute and long-term profitability.
Daniel H. Ives - FBR Capital Markets & Co.

Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me today are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel. On our website, microsoft.com/investor, we have posted our press release and a slide deck that provides a summary of our results this quarter.
Unless otherwise specified, all growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year. For selected metrics on the call and in other earnings materials, we have also provided growth rates in constant currency. We present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations.
Additionally, any mention of operating expense refers to segment operating expenses as defined in the footnote of our 10-Q and includes research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative but excludes integration and restructuring charges.
We will post the prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today’s call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website until April 23, 2016.
During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are pretty predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today’s earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Satya.
Satya Nadella
Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I’ll focus my remarks on our three business areas: Cloud, Windows and Devices. Next week at Build, our developer conference, I’ll share more about our ambitions and how our next-generation platforms will empower every person and organization.
This quarter, we delivered $21.7 billion in revenue, an increase of 6% year-over-year or 9% in constant currency. We are seeing the impact of foreign exchange, geopolitical trends in certain geographies and product transitions. We’re taking steps to respond quickly and adjust our plans as needed while we continue to move forward in our transformation.
Overall, I’m pleased with our business performance. More importantly though, it’s clear that we are well on our way to transforming our products and businesses across all of Microsoft. The early signs are evident in how our customers are using our products, which I’ll share throughout my remarks today. Our momentum in the cloud is a highlight. Increasingly, customers are choosing Microsoft cloud services to transform their own businesses, going beyond just moving existing workloads to the cloud. These results showcase our ability to transform and perform simultaneously.
With that in mind, I’ll walk you through the quarter, starting with our Cloud business. At the core of our results this quarter is incredible growth across a growing portfolio of cloud services. Our commercial Cloud business is a source of strength driven by Office 365, Azure and Dynamics CRM. Our commercial cloud annualized run rate now stands at $6.3 billion, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of triple-digit revenue growth.
Office 365 is clearly a key growth driver. Like any cloud service, we track how people are actually using it and we are proud that Office 365 is a vibrant, active service. Right now, there are nearly 50 million Office 365 monthly active users inside businesses. Exchange Online alone sees about 60 billion requests per day from all connected clients, about 70 billion transactions or user actions and there are 830 million meetings a month created in Office. And we’re increasing our Office value proposition for businesses with new mobile device management capabilities built into Office 365 and through our continued commitment to customer data compliance and security.
We released new versions of Office Dells for mobile devices, and earlier this month, we rolled out Skype for Business to the Office 365 customers worldwide. Finally, in anticipation of the release of Windows 10, we have announced a preview of new touch-first Office universal app. Small and medium-sized customers are adopting Office 365 at a continued rapid pace, led by our more than 65,000 Office 365 partners. Thirty telecommunications companies are already offering 365 to small and medium-sized customers, including some of the largest in the world. In Q3, we announced a new partnership with T-Mobile to bring Office 365 to more customers and enhance the partnership with GoDaddy.
At Build next week, I’ll talk to you even more about Office as a platform and how developers can connect into the Office framework to both harness the rich data and have their own application extensions available to ultimately a billion plus Office users. Azure is also seeing impressive usage momentum. Right now, more than five million organizations are represented in Azure Active Directory with more than 425 million identities. Storage is also a strong indicator of consumption, and now, we have 50 trillion objects stored in Azure, a 3x growth year-over-year in storage transactions, more than five trillion in March alone. And Azure websites are growing with nearly half a million sites hosted.
Beyond strong usage of our existing services, we are excited by the customer response to our expanding portfolio of new cloud offerings. In particular, Enterprise Mobility Suite is growing and we now have more than 13,000 enterprise customers using EMS. And as customer adoption and usage in the cloud increases, more developers are choosing Azure for the applications. Nearly three million developers are signed up for Visual Studio online, up 2x year-over-year. To foster developer innovation, we launched Azure App Service this quarter. It offers a powerful set of development tools for creating web and mobile app backends for any platform or device while enabling integration with other applications, including Office 365, Dynamics, Salesforce, Facebook, Twitter, SAP , Oracle, Siebel and many more.
We also delivered new Azure compute instances this quarter with more memory and storage than any other public cloud provider, attracting more mission-critical workloads to the cloud. And we improved our Big Data capabilities with support for the latest version of Hadoop and LINUX in HDInsight and improved disaster recovery with Azure Site Recovery and Backup . We’re seeing significant customer interest and adoption in Azure Machine Learning and Azure Stream Analytics , in particular, for IOT scenarios.
In a world where every company has the opportunity to become a software company, a diverse set of companies like ThyssenKrupp , Toyota, Rockwell , Ford, Fujitsu and Millay are engaging with us in their transformation.
Further, our Dynamics business also has traction in the enterprise. It is now nearly a $2 billion business. Dynamics CRM online enterprise paid seats more than doubled year-over-year, and we more than doubled enterprise seats sold this quarter for ERP. We also announced a wave of innovation in Microsoft Dynamics CRM this quarter with new social, mobile and analytics capabilities for business process transformation, including seamless integration of Dynamics CRM with Office 365.
While our commercial Cloud business is expanding dramatically, we’re also seeing strong growth in our consumer cloud services. Office 365 consumer added an average of one million new customers per month and we now have more than 12 million subscribers, an increase of 35% over the prior quarter. We’re clearly taking Office everywhere. Core to our mobile first strategy is to ensure that our service endpoints are on every mobile device, and to that end, we have seen continued momentum with more than 100 million downloads of Office on iPhones, iPads and Android tablets. And with the release of Outlook on iOS and Android this quarter, updates through our OneDrive application and a preview of the forthcoming Office for Mac, we’re making Office available to even more users on more devices.
Bing achieved a significant milestone this quarter when U.S. search share topped 20% and search advertising revenue grew 21%. Search is key to productivity in work and life and it’s a huge opportunity for Microsoft as we continue to innovate with Bing across our applications and platforms. On top of that, I’m pleased with our renewed partnership with Yahoo! and our combined ability to compete more effectively in the search marketplace. Our investments in innovation and user experience in Xbox Live are paying off. Xbox Live users grew 18% year-over-year, helping drive increased Xbox Live usage growth by 30%.
When I step back and look at Office 365, Bing search and Xbox Live collectively, I see real usage growth and monetization of our consumer services all up.
Now let’s talk about Windows. To start, our Windows revenue from business customers is stabilizing post the XP refresh anniversary, coming back in line to historical levels. We’re also transforming the consumer Windows business to adapt to the changing market dynamics, including lower price point devices. This quarter, while non-Pro revenue declined, activations were up. Importantly, we are now at a place where we can start to see early signs of how usage increases in services like search and gaming can drive new monetization opportunities over the lifetime of a Windows consumer device.
Windows is a tremendous asset for Microsoft, with more than 1.5 billion users. This means every day, hundreds of millions of people are using Windows and Windows applications. In fact, more than 60 million unique apps are used on a monthly basis from PCs running Windows 7 and later. We are focused on making Windows 10 the most loved version of Windows ever. Perhaps most importantly, last quarter, I talked about how Windows 10 will be a service across an array of devices and will usher in a new area era of more personal computing, an era where the mobility of the experience, not the device, is paramount. We look forward to sharing a lot more about Windows 10 at Build next week.
In our device portfolio, service adoption continues across enterprise and consumer customers, with 44% revenue growth year-over-year. And 64% of Surface Pro 3 users use OneNote, nine times that of any other touch laptop. This shows how great hardware innovation influences customer experience and usage. We’re looking forward to Surface 3 availability next month, a device that has received positive reviews for being a superior versatile device at a lower price point.
We continue to demonstrate momentum in the Value Smartphone segment of the phone market, driving 18% growth in Lumia volume this quarter. However, we need to take further action to reduce our costs across devices as we execute on our Windows 10 first-party hardware plans.
I’m excited that next week, I’ll be able to talk much more extensively about our ambitions and the opportunity ahead to two important audiences – developers at Build and our investor community at the Financial Analyst Briefing in San Francisco.
Before I turn it over to Amy, I want to close by reflecting on Microsoft’s transformation to a company that will thrive and help our customers thrive in a mobile-first, cloud-first world. This is a new world with new growth. It’s a world that requires fundamental transformation in products, business models and delivery models across Microsoft. In 2008, we started our transformation by taking an iconic franchise, Office, to the cloud. We took the next big step towards forwards five years ago when we launched Azure and another step forward with the recent announcement of Windows 10 as a service. Microsoft’s overall transformation isn’t about one-for-one shift. It is about delivering new value to more customers and unlocking new growth opportunities. To do this, we will continue to push forward with big ambitions and persistence while delivering solid performance.
With that, I’ll hand it over to Amy to talk about this quarter’s results in greater detail, and I look forward to rejoining you after to answer questions. Thank you.
Amy Hood
Thanks, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our execution in the third quarter. In our Commercial business, we continued to see healthy underlying fundamentals with strong renewals of volume license annuity contracts, a mix shift to cloud offerings and solid bookings. Importantly, you can see the progress we are making in the execution of our cloud strategy as the percentage of our revenue from annuity contracts in our Commercial business continues to rise.
As Satya highlighted, we also saw momentum in strategic businesses we’ve been investing in, such as Bing, Xbox Live and Surface, which have a key role in our plans to further monetize Windows devices. Like most multinational companies, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar has had a significant impact on our reported results. Accordingly, when applicable, I will give growth rates in both GAAP and constant currency to help you better understand the underlying business demand.
Revenue was $21.7 billion, up 6% and 9% in constant currency. Gross margin grew 1% and 4% in constant currency. We improved gross margin percentage year-over-year in each of our segments again this quarter, reflecting our ongoing focus on operational excellence. Operating income declined 5%. Adjusting for both integration and restructuring expense of $190 million, as well as the negative $87 million impact from FX, operating income declined 1%. Earnings per share was $0.61, which includes a $0.02 negative impact from FX and $0.01 of integration and restructuring expense.
As a reminder, FX movements first impact our bookings growth and unearned revenue on the balance sheet. Each quarter, our contracted not-billed balance is adjusted to reflect current FX rates. When FX rates move rapidly, as they have in the last six months, bookings growth can be significantly impacted. This was the case again this quarter as bookings grew 2%. However, when measured on a constant currency basis, bookings grew 9%. Unearned revenue was up 4% year-over-year to $20.2 billion and 7% in constant currency. Total unearned revenue was slightly below expectations, driven primarily by a stronger-than-expected mix of sales that are recognized in the current period.
From a geographic perspective the U.S. outperformed our expectations. This relative strength in the U.S. resulted in roughly one point less of constant currency impact than we expected in our Commercial business. China, Russia and Japan were generally in line with our expectations.
I want to touch briefly on what we were seeing in Japan, given it’s our second-largest market from a revenue perspective. Revenue was down $550 million, which is nearly four points of growth for the whole company. With high Office attach to PCs, revenue is particularly sensitive to the underlying PC market dynamics. Q3 was the toughest comparable due to both XP end of support and the VAT increase which went into effect last April 1. The impact is most evident in our DMC and Commercial Licensing segments. The macroeconomic climate remains challenging as well in Japan and we don’t expect this to change in the short term.
With that backdrop I will now moved to a detailed discussion of our results, starting with Windows. Q3 last year was the peak of the XP refresh cycle, evidenced by Windows Pro revenue growth of 19%. This growth significantly outpaced the underlying PC market driven by higher attach of Pro, particularly with large enterprise customers in developed markets. This quarter Pro revenue declined by 19% and is essentially flat to our Q3 FY 2013 levels as both business PCs and Pro mix in that segment returned to pre-XP refresh levels.
For Windows non-Pro as we talked about last quarter, inventory in the channel was higher than normal. This quarter activations grew and we exited Q3 with channel inventories at more normal levels. This channel inventory reduction was the main driver of our Windows non-Pro revenue decline. We continued to see a mix shift opening price point PCs which impacted license mix and aggregate ASP. However, it was significantly less than the impact in Q2 when holiday sales favored lower price point PCs.
Office consumer revenue and D&C licensing was down 41% this quarter due primarily to the shift of purchasing toward Office 365 Consumer where we now have 12.4 million subscribers. This transition to Office 365 accounted for 27 points of that decline and the impact of Japan’s PC market the remaining 14 points. Excluding Japan, we grew our combined consumer Office licenses by 10%.
Revenue in our Devices and Consumer Other segment grew 25% and 28% in constant currency, exceeding our expectations. Many of our growth efforts are represented in this segment and we made terrific progress this quarter across Office 365, Bing and Xbox Live transactions. Gross margin expanded again, benefiting from the increased scale in our services. Inclusive of the estimated impact of the Yahoo! agreement reached last week, we remain confident in our goal of Bing profitability in FY 2016.
Moving to hardware, revenue from Xbox consoles declined largely due to a mix shift of Xbox One consoles to lower ASP SKUs, as well as the impact of launch supply from a year ago. With Surface we saw 53% constant currency revenue growth driven by strong retail sales and attach of accessories. On phones we sold 8.6 million Lumia devices and have gained share in key markets such as the U.K. and Germany over the course of the year. Gross margin declined sequentially, driven by lower Q3 revenue and approximately $60 million of negative impact from foreign currency relative to Q2 FX rates.
We’ve made significant progress in reducing the operating expense base in the Phone business, moving from an annualized rate of $4.5 billion at acquisition to a run rate under $2.5 billion. That said, the changing mix of our portfolio to the value segment and the significant negative headwind from FX will impact our ability to reach operational breakeven in FY 2016. In response we have in Q3 and will continue in Q4 to aggressively focus on our operating cost base by pursuing efficiencies in both COGS and operating expenses. We will focus those efforts across our entire first party device portfolio, even while we expand into new form factors such as Whole Lens and Surface hub.
Now moving to our commercial results, where revenue grew 5% or 7% in constant currency. Commercial bookings declined 1% on a reported basis but grew 10% in constant currency. The underlying health of the business remains very strong despite the negative impact from specific geos and prior-year XP comparables.
The transition of our customers to cloud and subscription annuity services is a critical element of our business transformation. To provide ongoing transparency into our progress we’ve added a new KPI commercial annuity mix. This quarter 82% of our commercial revenue came from annuity revenue streams which is up 5 points from last year. While quarter-to-quarter the mix can vary with uneven growth rates we’ve seen in transactional licensing before and after the XP refresh cycle. The overall trend clearly reflects the meaningful progress that we have made.
Office commercial products and services declined 2% but grew 1% in constant currency. Japan was a three-point drag. We successfully renewed a large volume of annuity contract expirations in Q3 at healthy levels in line with historical rate. And we continue to see a strong shift from traditional licensing to Office 365 across our business customers. In each of the last three quarters we have added more Office 365 seats than transactional licenses with SMB customers.
Server products and services continued to exhibit strong momentum with revenue growth of 12% and 16% in constant currency. Our portfolio is well-positioned to meet the needs of our customers for their private, public and hybrid cloud solutions. Adoption of our premium products remains strong and revenue grew 25% across our premium offerings for SQL, System Center and Windows Server.
Overall, revenue from our commercial cloud services more than doubled again this quarter. Enterprise penetration is accelerating with over half of all agreements signed during the quarter including cloud services. Within Office 365 premium workload now make up more than 50% of the install base and we are seeing strong attach of our enterprise mobility solutions to Office 365. As our usage grew rapidly this quarter and Dynamics CRM online benefited from strong customer growth.
Moving now to operating expenses which were favorable to our guidance driven by decisions that we made during the quarter to reduce spending and to continue to reallocate resources to accelerate growth in key areas. For instance, in markets where we are facing challenges, we reduced our sales and marketing expense to reflect the current environment and as I mentioned earlier in my comments on our phone business, we took further actions to lower our cost base. Across the company we continue to prioritize and reallocate our spend to activities with the highest impact.
The result was that operating expenses grew 4% for the company. Normalizing for the approximately $300 million year-over-year benefit from FX and the addition of $570 million related to phone, operating expenses grew just 1%.
Our effective tax rate was 24%, which is 5 points higher than last year. The increase is primarily driven by the inclusion of our phone results and our changing geographic mix.
We returned $7.5 billion to shareholders this quarter which is an increase of $3 billion from Q2. This change is consistent with our objective to increase capital return to shareholders with the focus on value.
With that overview the current quarter, let me now turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter. I’ll start with a few overall comments for additional context. The guidance that we are providing is based on current FX rates and should actual rates differ they will be reflected in our financial results. As a reminder, in our annuity businesses the FX impact is first reflected in our unearned revenue as is it is based on rates when the contract is billed and then into the P&L at that same rate as the revenue is recognized generally over the next year.
In Q4 unearned revenue will reflect three quarters of billings with the stronger U.S. dollar which will negatively impact year-over-year comparables. Likewise, we’ll be recognizing a higher percentage of revenue from periods with the stronger U.S. dollar in both the recently completed Q3 and also the prior-year comparisons. In total, we expect FX will impact revenue growth by approximately four points in Q4 with the majority of that impact in our Commercial segment. While XP-related comparables remain tough for Q4, we are starting to anniversary the XP benefits from last year.
And finally, from a geographic perspective, we expect the year-over-year declines in Japan to continue. With that additional context, I’ll now move to more specific guidance, starting with Devices and Consumer.
In licensing, in Q4 last year, we recognized $382 million of revenue related to the end of the commercial agreement with Nokia, which will impact year-over-year growth trends. For this Q4, we expect revenue to be $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion. This range reflects the anniversary of XP, the impact of the Japanese economy and an anticipated draw-down of inventories in the PC ecosystem ahead of the release of Windows 10 this summer. Within consumer Office, we expect similar trends to Q3, including the continued transition to Office 365 subscriptions.
In Computing and Gaming Hardware, with the addition of Surface 3, we expect revenue to be $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion. In Phone Hardware, we expect revenue to be $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, with continued momentum in value smartphones and anticipated declines in non-Lumia phones. Gross margins will reflect similar dynamics to Q3. In Devices and Consumer Other, we expect revenue to be $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion with continued growth in Bing, Office 365 and Xbox Live transactions. In Commercial Licensing, we expect revenue of $10.5 billion to $10.6 billion with a continuing shift to annuity. This range reflects roughly four points of negative impact from FX in addition to the factors I discussed earlier. In Commercial Other, we expect momentum to continue in our commercial cloud with revenue $3.0 billion to $3.1 billion. And in Corporate, we don’t expect any revenue impact.
We expect COGS to be $7.2 billion to $7.4 billion with variability being driven by both hardware segments. We expect operating expenses to be $8.4 billion to $8.5 billion. This range implies that our full-year operating expenses will be roughly $2 billion below our initial guidance for the year while still investing in key growth opportunities across R&D and sales.
We have benefited from FX, but the biggest driver has been our ongoing cost discipline and prioritization efforts. In Q4, we expect to incur $100 million integration expenses and, separately, another $100 million in restructuring expenses. As a reminder, other income and expense includes dividend and interest income offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging. Given the current FX environment, we expect our net cost of hedging to increase and other income and expense to be negative $200 million. We expect our Q4 tax rate to be 22% to 24%.
In Q4, we expect CapEx to sequentially increase in support of our growing Cloud business. And we expect unearned revenue will grow sequentially, in line with historical seasonality, excluding the foreign currency impact.
In closing, as you heard from Satya, we are making progress in our strategic goals and we are seeing are focused investments land in differentiated products, customer usage and sales results. Customers are seeing and embracing our innovation, leading to increased usage of our cloud services and a transition towards subscription and multiyear purchasing. We continued to invest aggressively to capture opportunities where we see competitive advantage while also becoming more efficient to accelerate our pace of innovation.
We encourage you next week to watch the webcast of keynotes from our Build developer conference. We will share more of the innovation happening with Windows 10 and our cloud services. We’ll also host our financial analyst briefing, where Satya, Kevin Turner and I will discuss how the company’s transformation provides unique growth opportunities that drive increased lifetime customer value across our core businesses. We look forward to sharing that progress with you.
And with that, let me turn it back over to Chris for Q&A.
Chris Suh
Thanks, Amy. We’ll now move to Q&A. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. We’ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please proceed.
Brent Thill
Good afternoon. You had great momentum in the cloud. I was curious if you could just talk about the positioning in both in on trend and cloud environments? And also weave in what you’re seeing with Azure.
Satya Nadella
Sure, Brent. Thanks for the question. Overall when I think about the Microsoft cloud it’s really the combination of Office 365 dynamics as well as Azure. We think about our capital allocation that way, we think about our utilization product architecture and customer value and how uniquely we can bring these three assets together to serve our customers well. And that’s the momentum you see and I talked about the run rate, the usage metrics and there’s really increasing intensity of usage amongst organizational customers in our commercial cloud. One of the other things also is a huge benefit for us is, because our cloud, our public cloud runs on our software assets, our software asset gets packaged up as our servers.
In fact, I think of our servers as the edge of our cloud. So the unique capability we now have in Windows Server, SQL Server is becoming that much more competitive. Because we’re running our public cloud in it and that’s what anyone deploying their own private cloud expects to have. And so you see there’s two sides of benefits and two sides for us. One is in our cloud momentum, which itself is the combination of SAS applications, paths , and IADs which I believe is unique in the marketplace as well as with the software itself is packaged up into our private cloud offering be it Windows Server or SQL Server and they’re becoming increasingly competitive in the enterprise and data center additions. And so that’s what you’ve seen in our commercial results, both on the licensing side as well as on the cloud side.
Chris Suh
Thanks, Brett. We’ll move to the next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse.
Philip Winslow
Hi. Thanks. Congratulations on a great quarter. I just wanted to focus in on Office 365 because some of those metrics really jumped out to us. It seems like overall revenue between commercial and E&D for Office 365 is up over 100%. If you look at the consumer user count is up pretty huge this quarter-to-quarter there. The question is sort of about Satya and Amy. Satya when you think about the positioning and sort of where we are in just the adoption lifecycle of Office 365 on the consumer side and then the SMB and enterprise. Where are we in terms of the inflection point there? And then Amy, how should we think about going forward in terms of the guidance that you gave how we should think about the financial implications of where we are in that transition from off-premise to the Office 365?
Satya Nadella
Let me start, and Amy you could take it from there. Overall I would say there’s a secular movement that’s happening in particular with Office 365, quite frankly, it’s happening across the entire product portfolio of Microsoft which is more to what I would described as annuity relationship as well as subscription relationships. Because those of a long-term contracts relationships we want to have with our customers be it consumer, be it small business or large customers. In all the years I’ve been at Microsoft it was always our dream to be able to sell more of the sophisticated capabilities of Office to individual consumers as well as small businesses.
But it was hard to do in the previous generation because of the server infrastructure and what I would say sophistication of IT required. Whereas now with the cloud for the first time we now can serve both individuals as well as small businesses with the same kind of sophistication that in the past was exclusively available for the large enterprises. That’s what you see when we see our subscription growth in consumer, we see subscription growth in small business these are folks who never bought a server from us. So that’s what we’re seeing is increasing, what I would call, annuity relationships and subscription relationships with all classes of customers.
And it’s new penetration, so it’s not even a one-for-one replacement, even for the enterprise customer there consumption is going up. They may have consumed one or two workloads but now they can have the opportunity to consume the entirety of the portfolio and not just that. If you look at the products in Office 365 that we have, take eDiscovery it’s a complete new space for us where we are able to do things in security eDiscovery enterprise management that we didn’t even do for the top end of the enterprise in the service side, so that’s what we’re seeing.
Amy Hood
And, Phil, on the math that sits behind that, it’s a good timing. Next week at the financial analyst briefing, I’ll send the – and have a lot more time to explain the actual lifetime value of each of these customer segments, especially in Office 365. But I think in consumer, it’s maybe the easiest one to talk about, is that we talked about license growth of 10%, when you correct for Japan. Our ability to quickly, I think, move our customer base through stronger execution, both direct through retail and having our channel execute well and partner with us on this transition. I do think we’ve made a lot of progress. And maybe more importantly, we continue to innovate in the product and deliver value to the end user, which is really what matters. And so I think we’ll be able to show the progress we’ve made over every quarter, and give you some goals going forward. So I look forward to having the chance to spend more time on that in detail.
And SMB looks very similar in some ways. They purchased similarly, was bought with a PC, was bought one time, it was infrequent, with an inability, as Satya said, to add workloads. So I think those are some of the bigger transitions you’ve seen for us in terms of being able to increase the value. So hopefully, we’ll be able to give you more details on that next week.
Philip Winslow
I’ve been waiting for those details for years. I appreciate that. All right. Thanks, guys.
Chris Suh
Thanks, Phil. Next question, please, operator.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Keith Weiss
Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question, and a very nice quarter. I think one of the highlights of the past year has definitely been the expense control, and I guess you could call it, like a normalized OpEx growth of just 1% in the quarter, continues to be very impressive. How should investors, and how should we think about the sustainability of that expense control. Or how long can you keep sort of investing for these growth initiatives, like cloud, yet keep your overall OpEx growth rate so low on a go forward basis?
Satya Nadella
Let me start, and then I’ll have Amy add. Overall, the core of how I want us to approach expenses is to make sure that we are not limited in our ability to invest in categories where we have unique things to, contribute. So we’re going to do that though, with great discipline, and that’s what I think you’ve seen us do over the course of the last year, and we’ll continue to exhibit that. But at the same time, we will not shrink away from our ability to go put investment, be it in sales, marketing or product R&D, when we clearly have unique things in secular categories of growth. And that’s something that we have the capability of doing, and we want to be able to do that in a disciplined way.
Amy Hood
And I would just add, I generally think about two key items that we’ve been able to think about, across the leadership team. First is, I think we have exhibited an increasing ability, over the course of the year, to reallocate during the year, both at the organization level and at the team level, to make sure our dollars are going to the highest ROI things. And secondly, I think it’s a general belief held at the highest levels of the company, that operating efficiency increases our ability to be responsive, both to the needs of our customers, as well as innovate faster inside this place. And I think when you take those two things, along with what Satya said, being able to balance disciplined focus and execution for us, I think we feel very good about the progress we’ve made.
Keith Weiss
Yes. Thank you.
Chris Suh
Thanks, Keith. Next question, please, operator.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Rick Sherlund with Nomura. Please proceed.
Rick Sherlund
Thank you. Satya, you mentioned, a year ago, that we’re going to see a next generation of personal productivity software. I wonder if you could update us on what that means. And when we might see that as just an extension of Office 365? Or how do we monetize those products? And when will we hear more about them? And Amy, we didn’t see any tech guarantees in the quarter for the upcoming Windows 10 launch, and we also haven’t heard anything more about changes in accounting for Windows 10, given that there’s going to be a big undelivered element there. Is that something we should expect to hear more about next week?
Satya Nadella
Sure. Let me start. Thanks, Rick. What I think about even just my own day-to-day usage of Office, even in the last year, it’s gone through a drastic amount of change. Of course, I use Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Outlook, on a daily basis. But if I think about all the tools that I’m using, which is all part of Office 365, today, on a daily basis and multiple times a day I start my day as I talked about in many conferences with Dell which is a tool I love which is in fact something that’s uniquely possible because of the shift to Office 365 where we can take organizational data and breakthrough all the boundaries or, again, in silos inside an organization and have people discover information. It’s the richest way for me to visualize what’s happening at Microsoft in real time. That news feed for me is kind of the lifeblood of Microsoft. I use Power BI . One of the things that we talked a lot about is usage.
In fact, one of the cultural changes inside the company is everyone from the frontline engineer to the frontline salesperson is responsible for usage. And given that, we want to have these leading indicators showing up in our dashboard not are static reports and Power BI is this rich canvas for us to be able to, one, visualize data as well as ask natural language questions. I look at my own usage of one note in Surface. That’s gone through a fee change both because of the hardware innovation, innovation in Windows, innovation in Office. I look at something like Sway which I’m pretty excited about because basically we’re taking the concept of what is an interactive document and the website and bringing it all together into these Sway documents if you well and if you’re excited about what that could mean in customer service marketing or for school reports.
So that’s – we are well into it so that is not going to be waiting for some future date to release anything that’s new, but we’re well on our way with all of these tools and they’re available today and we’ll of course be iterating continuously.
Amy Hood
And, Rick, on your other two questions specific to the tech guarantee that you would think about the time of year, due to the specific nature of the offer we have on Windows 10, there won’t be a tech guarantee as you think about it for this upgrade cycle and there’s disclosure in fact, in our revenue recognition section in the 10-Q that talks about that specifically. When we talk about the accounting for Windows 10, I will touch on that next week but as we get closer to the launch we’ll go into more specifics.
And I’m so excited about the space. I don’t want to miss this one other big scenario which is Cortana , that’s perhaps the thing that’s going to change personal productivity even most and especially with Windows 10 and how Cortana comes to Windows, both to the browser as well as to the start, I think it completely change what personal productivity software mean from a day-to-day experience as well.
Chris Suh
Thanks, Rick. Next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein. Please proceed.
Mark Moerdler
Satya, Amy, congrats on the quarter. Thank you for taking my question. So if Windows OEM Pro has now stabilized excluding the bump that we saw from XP Refresh and volume licensing at least in constant currency is stable growing, should we figure that we’ve now started to turn the quarter on commercial Windows revenue? In addition, where do you think we are on the consumer side on the non-OEM front? Is that something that continue to shrink for a bit?
Amy Hood
Let me take that one. Satya, you can add at the end of you want. No. I think, Mark, you’re reading it correctly. We actually had our annuity volume licensing business as you know, has been showing growth and stability for a while as we talked about Pro is back to the pre-XP levels and while could see some fluctuation, I think this has been a very stable business for us for a long period of time when you take out that XP bump from last year. Talking about consumer, I think frankly Satya and I both reflected a bit on it in our comments. We do expect to see some additional inventory draw down in front of a launch. That’s not unusual prior to a launch cycle and that will clearly impact our revenue in the quarter.
But I think as I look to 2016, I’m excited about the designs we’ve seen, I’m excited about the products that are possible with Windows 10, and I think we feel good and are looking forward to sharing some of that excitement next week.
Satya Nadella
Yeah, the one thing I’d also add is there is actually a much more fundamental transformation happening even with how we think about Windows and its delivery and we’ll talk more about this even at our financial analyst briefing next week because I increasingly think about the lifetime value we can deliver to the user of a Windows device be it in consumer or even in the enterprise. And if you think about when we say Windows-as-a-service it’s actually a pretty profound construct which involves us being able to not only think about what ships with OEMs, but how do we on a continuous basis, if it’s a consumer we have things now in the store, we have subscriptions, we have gaming and then when it comes to the enterprise there’s management, security, servicing which is all unique value. So there is going to be an increasing emphasis in the concept of lifetime value that we can deliver to customers.
Mark Moerdler
Perfect. I really do appreciate it.
Satya Nadella
Thanks, Mark.
Mark Moerdler
Thank you.
Chris Suh
Thank you, Mark. Next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies. Please proceed.
John DiFucci
Thanks. Listen, it sounds like Cloud and Azure represents an opportunity to transition existing customers to a Cloud model, but also to expand your customer base or penetrate – or penetration into your current customer base with – I mean incremental business is what I’m talking about. I would think that most of Office 365, because most people were already on Office, represents transition from life to license model, but so far, and I know it’s still early, but so far what about the rest? Can you give us an idea of how much of this is new business and how much of this is transition business?
Satya Nadella
Let me start and then you can add. I mean I think you have to sort of look at all the use cases. In fact as I said, a lot of the Azure use case, I think you referenced this, have been non-zero-sum because our people started building their mobile back end, web back end using Big Data not workloads we have. I look at sort of everyday usage growth, even if they’re creating a web workload it’s for a very different type of web back end and a mobile back end. And the same thing with advanced analytics. I even look at the growth of virtual machine instances on Azure. We not only see Windows Server obviously but we see 20%-plus of Linux growth. So that’s again non-zero-sum .
So there’s significant traction we have in terms of moving beyond just one-for-one shift of a workload that traditionally ran on our server to our Azure Cloud. In fact if anything the majority of what we are seeing is new. Even in Office 365 it’s not just one-for-one shift. Of course if you are – were using as a large enterprise Exchange and you moved to Office 365 you moved to using Exchange Online; same thing is true for SharePoint. But again take all the other things I described, power BI , Dell and the list goes on, take eDiscovery; even for the largest of enterprise these were things that had low penetration or low deployment. And so we are seeing increasing usage of that.
Same thing with our Dynamics business. EMS , it’s completely a new category. We never had that kind of a management footprint. We now have the ability to have one control plane for IT for all the devices, identity management, device management, data protection. That’s a new workload. So that’s what we’re seeing. We definitely are seeing one-for-one migration, but the opportunity in everyone one of our offerings from Office 365 to Dynamics to Azure has a non-zero-sum component to it.
John DiFucci
Thanks, Satya. Just want to be clear because you said something, I mean other than Office 365 did you say the majority of the Cloud business is new business? Or – and again, I know it can’t be – I mean maybe you know exactly what it is but I’m sure some of it is somewhat cloudy or – no pun intended, or vague, but do you think most of it at this point is new business? Is that what I heard you say?
Satya Nadella
Yeah, and also it sort of comes in interesting ways because one of the things IT, as you know, it’s not about sort of replacing what you have, it’s always augmenting what you have. A very classic scenario would be I’ll take a SQL database application, bring it to the Cloud and then build a new mobile back end using the same data. So reuse of code, reuse of data, so you would use some amount if iOS infrastructure and then past consumption. So that’s one of the very typical enterprise solutions you will see. In fact, our own IT Systems, take what we have done with our HR and our financial systems and some of those things as they move to the Cloud, we bring some existing and then add to it.
Amy Hood
And, John, to your specific question, you’re right. A lot of the Azure is, the good way to think about that is new; and especially our Dynamics business, CRM online and some of the work we’ve done across AX is certainly all new. And the lower down in the segment of Office you get, the more new it is, is the way to think about it.
John DiFucci
Great. Thank you very much.
Chris Suh
Thanks. Next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed.
Walter Pritchard
Hi. Just a follow up to the question John had on Azure. Amazon released their profitability for the first time on AWS and it was I think higher than most people were expecting. I’m wondering how we should think about your mix of business in Azure? You’re running Linux, you’re running a lot of services based on open source software, you’re also running some of your own IP there. How should we think about where your margins are today and should we think of Amazon’s AWS margins as a good benchmark for where you could be at like sort of scale they’re at today?
Satya Nadella
First of all, I don’t think that of the comparison between Azure and AWS is the true north for me. I think about the Microsoft Cloud because even the way we do capital, the way we measure utilization is all with the complete unit, which is of course all of Office 365 runs on Azure, Azure AD powers all of our Cloud, so it’s really its entirety that we think of as our unique value. So that means we have SaaS which is a huge component between O 365 and Dynamics, PaaS which is a huge component of Azure itself. We see many customers who would use even our PaaS services and even AWS. So we – for example, you can in fact do a single sign-on using EMS and Azure AD in Azure and use – so your resources on AWS.
And then of course we have our iOS business. So that’s how we think about it. And then it’s reflected even in our margins. So when we look at our Cloud margins, they will have our revenue quality, which is very different; that’s a combination of past iOS and SaaS. And that’s how we want to make sure we make progress, because that’s where both product value which is unique to us and also the quality of revenue that’s unique to us.
But the one other thing that I – see my world view is not that all compute storage networks just goes to one place. That’s why I think of our servers as the edge of our Cloud, and as I said there’s a huge software asset in there which is becoming increasingly competitive. Of course we don’t count that in our run rates or when we talk about our $6 billion plus run rate, that’s just pure public Cloud number and that’s fantastic to see and we want to measure it that way. But quite frankly if you sort of looked at what’s broadly happening in the Cloud transition, we are participating in both the private hybrid Cloud as well as the public Cloud.
Chris Suh
Thanks, Walter.
Walter Pritchard
Amy on OpEx, you have – I guess not necessarily you but the company generally at this time has given some color into the next fiscal year’s OpEx. Is that something we should expect at the Build event with your Analyst Meeting next week? Or any – I’m sure you’re not going to give it to us today but – or right here, but just wanted to figure out expectations around when we should hear about that?
Amy Hood
We’ll continue to talk generally about it. I don’t expect to give specific guidance on FY 2016 next week.
Walter Pritchard
Okay.
Amy Hood
Okay, Walter.
Walter Pritchard
Thank you very much.
Chris Suh
Thanks. We’ll go to the next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Heather Bellini
Great. I had two questions. One was related to the success of the sub 250 machines that you guys in the market have been seeing and just what geos have seen the best uptake for those so far? And then just, if there is a little bit more color you can share about the drivers of the commercial licensing business and I’ve recognized all the affiliate that you guys just gave guidance for Q4. But as kind of as we look out over the next year or two, what are the big puts and takes in particular maybe on the server and tool side that we need to think about?
Satya Nadella
I’ll start. I think as far as the low-cost devices, it’s pretty broad. I think we think of the U.S. itself being in fact a big driver of some of the growth on the consumer side. We’re also obviously – stimulated this so that we can be much more effective even in the educational markets worldwide. And Amy can add to that if we had any more detail on it.
When it comes to our Commercial Licensing and our servers, it’s the same trend, Heather, which is the big shift that’s happening is our enterprise and datacenter products, being Windows Server, Systems Centers , SQL Server, are more competitive. It’s the same thing that I would say at least in the last couple of years clearly have played out. There is clearly – and in fact, as our products have become competitive there’s been this mix shift. People have bought from us previously just standard editions are able to now look at our enterprise editions and that’s what’s playing out.
And there’s definitely some pricing action we were able to take, but mostly because we were able to deliver this incremental value. And even with all the pricing action we took, we, from a total cost of ownership or just raw pricing perspective are very competitive versus what’s available in the market. So that’s what we see. And so the cycle some of the pricing actions obviously were anniversary out, but the overall thing that I’m focused on is how can we continue to run our software asset ourselves in public cloud and translate that into our servers. And really paint this vision and make it a reality of hybrid computing and drive the secular growth of that.
Amy Hood
Thanks, Heather.
Chris Suh
We’ll have time for one more question, please.
Operator
Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Mark Murphy
Yeah, Satya, I’m wondering what inning do you think we are in terms of building out the next generation data centers but you’ll need to support the commercial cloud. For example, do you think you’ve built out data center capacity to support the commercial cloud business all the way to a $10 billion dollars run rate or $20 billion run rates? So if there’s any way you can help us to try to gauge how much overhead you have in the capacity. And perhaps what type of data center footprint you envision a few years down the road.
Satya Nadella
In fact, one of the big changes that has happened I would say in the last couple of years, and I’ll have Amy even detail out. It’s the way we’re going about everything from the very long lead things like actual data center locations and Build out to the procurement of individual machines, and essentially the work in progress inventory of that. We have driven significant process improvement to essentially make it as efficient as one can make it and that’s a continuous process for us.
So when I think about even the capital allocation per quarter we very carefully look at what is our current utilization forecast, and what our demand forecast is. And we now have the ability to be much more dynamic. Surely there are some things which are long lead like data center location. But you don’t need to build out data centers much before they’re really being utilized. And so we have a very good process and that’s a place were quite frankly a lot of the proprietary advantage of someone who is an at scale public cloud provider, not just with one application. And this is where the huge distinction is. After all we did run large-scale consumer services ourselves between Xbox LIVE and Bing. But this business of supporting a highly geo distributed enterprise cloud business is very different than just running in one at scale public cloud service. And we learned a lot with what is our workload diversity as well as our geo-diversity. And our supply chain management is optimized for it.
Amy Hood
Yeah, I would just add Mark. This is a place as Satya said we have made a lot of progress in being data-driven. This is down to a monthly review by workload, by property, by geo. And this is a place where I feel that we are in it terrific position frankly to respond to data sovereignty demands, changes politically and our ability to execute that to provide what our customers demand in terms of security and manageability and location. It’s something that we also care a lot about.
Mark Murphy
Thank you.
Chris Suh
Thanks. Mark.

Welcome to Microsoft's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2016 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Chris Suh, General Manager of Investor Relations. Chris, please proceed.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary.
On our website, microsoft.com/investor, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provide for the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Unless otherwise specified, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on today's call. The non-GAAP measures exclude the net impact from revenue deferrals and the impact of integration and restructuring charges. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They're included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's second quarter performance, in addition to the impact of these items and events had on the financial results.
All growth comparisons we make on the call relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. We also provide growth rates in constant currency when available, as a framework for assessing how our underlying business has performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. At the segment level, we provide constant currency growth for both revenue and gross margin. However, due to recent change in our segment reporting groupings, we aren't able to provide segment level constant currency operating expense growth, and consequently cannot derive constant currency segment operating income either. We do provide constant currency operating expense and operating income growth at the company-wide level.
Please note that we have recast certain prior period items to conform to the current period presentation with no impact on consolidated net income or cash flow. Additionally, any mention of operating expense refers to segment operating expenses as defined in the footnotes of our Form 10-Q and includes research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative, but excludes the impact of the last year's integration and restructuring charges.
We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included on our live transmission in the transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website until January 27, 2017.
During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
And with, that I'll turn the call over to Satya.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon everyone. Today Amy and I will share the results of our second quarter and look ahead. Overall this quarter, we had solid performance and more importantly drove growth in areas that are key to our future. We delivered $25.7 billion in revenue with an operating income of $7.9 billion. We continue to advance towards our goals for fiscal year 2018. Our commercial cloud run rate surpassed $9.4 billion, up over 70% year over year and almost halfway to our goal of $20 billion. We nearly doubled our cloud customers over the last 12 months.
We also made progress towards our goal of more than 1 billion Windows 10 monthly active devices. We crossed the 200 million milestone, and Windows 10 is outpacing adoption of any of our previous operating systems. In fact, adoption is nearly 140% faster than Windows 7. I appreciate the incredible work and focus of both Microsoft team members and our partners to deliver these results.
Now let's get to the specifics for each of the three segments, starting with Productivity and Business Process. As we seek to help people get more out of every moment, we are delivering new innovation and seeing new opportunity with Office 365. Consumer response to Office is strong. Office attach rate is up. Office 2016 adoption is outperforming Office 2013 over the same period of time, and consumer subscriptions are up to more than 20 million.
We're also enthusiastic about how people use Office on other platforms. On iOS and Android, Skype has more than 900 million downloads and Office apps surpassed 340 million this quarter. There are also 30 million iOS and Android active devices running Outlook. Office 365 commercial revenue grew nearly 70% in constant currency while seats grew 59%. It is clear customers value the ongoing innovation we are delivering in Office 365 and this allows us to advance further into markets like voice and information protection.
In December, we released a major update to Skype for Business, which drives productivity up and costs down. Our customers can now use Skype for Business to get a dial tone without the need of their own PBX and conduct online meetings for up to 10,000 attendees.
Security is both a mandate and an opportunity for Microsoft across all our segments. As customers look to protect themselves, we are creating new demand for all of our security solutions. The number of people using our information protection capabilities built into Office 365 increased 25% quarter over quarter. At the same time, we released new capabilities like Advanced Threat Protection, Advanced eDiscovery and Customer Lockbox. These new innovations in voice and information protection accrue to our premium productivity and collaboration SKU E5 which we released last month.
Our Dynamics business is also contributing to our growth in the cloud. This quarter we released major updates to Dynamics NAV and Dynamics CRM, both of which deliver enhancements in mobility, insights and organizational productivity, as well as deeper integration with Azure and Office 365. Three out of four of our CRM customers are choosing to deploy in the cloud, which is driving continued triple digit paid seat growth for CRM Online in the enterprise.
Our momentum with Office 365 and Dynamics creates a compelling case for developers. This quarter, we exposed the data APIs which capture the relationships between people, conversations, projects, schedules, processes and content. We call these APIs the Microsoft Graph. The ability for developers to build on the Microsoft Graph presents a strategic opportunity for our customers and partners. Smartsheet has already taken advantage of these APIs. Oracle plans to use Microsoft Graph to enhance their line of business applications like Oracle Sales Cloud, and many innovative startups are extending it to create new generation of productivity applications.
Now let's move to the Intelligent Cloud segment. The enterprise cloud opportunity is massive, larger than any market we have ever participated in. Last quarter, I reflected on how we are now one of the two leaders in the space. At the same time, we are the only one in this market providing SaaS, PaaS, IaaS and hybrid cloud at scale. We are growing in each of these areas simultaneously. Our unique approach is resonating. Our cloud architecture reflects real world distributed cloud computing needs and services that enable businesses to convert data into intelligence and drive business transformation.
Azure revenue grew 140% this quarter in constant currency, with revenue coming from new and existing customers. We saw organizations like NTT DOCOMO, Honeywell, NASA's Jet Propulsion Labs, Dow Chemical and the UN Development Programme deploy innovative solutions on Azure. We see that Azure customers who also purchase Office 365 consume eight times more Azure than other customers. More than 70% of the Fortune 500 have at least two different Microsoft cloud offerings, up 13 points year over year. And now we're continuing to grow in new ways. Together with Red Hat, Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, we will increase our ability to address real world infrastructure needs. These partnerships give customers the flexibility to connect their existing on-premise infrastructure or Linux-based applications with our cloud.
We are leading innovation in new Agile and DevOps workloads as well, with Azure App Services, PowerApps and Visual Studio Team Services, where we surpassed 3.8 million developer subscriptions. We are adding thousands of new developers every day who are building cloud and mobile solutions that support industries like oil and gas, finance, e-commerce, consulting and healthcare. As we expand into new markets, our revenue from premium services like security, mobility management and analytics nearly tripled year over year. Enterprise Mobility solution customers have more than doubled year over year and we have nearly tripled our share among Fortune 500 in the last 12 months.
Security is now a major driver of the cloud adoption. As threats become more frequent and sophisticated, Azure's unique technology like machine learning empower customers to adapt to these new realities. This quarter we organized the Enterprise Cybersecurity Group to help customers prepare for and respond to attacks. We unveiled plans for new data centers in Germany and the UK that address customers' data access and sovereignty needs. And we continue to release new capabilities like Advanced Threat Analytics as part of our $1 billion product innovation and security spanning Azure, Office 365, Windows 10 and our Enterprise Mobility Suite.
At the heart of every business in the future will be systems of intelligence, powerful AI that helps people understand the past and predict the future. Cortana Analytics is the building block for these systems of intelligence. We released Cortana Analytics last July. It's a comprehensive suite of services that enable businesses to reason over massive quantities of data that emanate from connected people, places and things and converts them into intelligent insights and automation.
Coca-Cola, Russell Reynolds, and the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health System already use Cortana Analytics to dramatically change the way they market products to customers, uncover talent in the workforce and offer patients predictive and more personalized healthcare. Our goal is to make it possible for every company in every industry and every country to take advantage of this new artificial intelligence to transform.
In the More Personal Computing segment, I'm encouraged by our progress to unify our installed base on Windows 10 and to create new opportunities for Microsoft and our entire ecosystem. As of this month, we crossed 200 million active devices running Windows 10. Near term in what analysts predicts will be relative flat market over this next year, we are focused on three ways to drive growth for our partners and for Microsoft: first, deliver more value in innovation, particularly for enterprise customers who need advanced productivity, security and device management; second, grow new monetization through services across a unified Windows platform; third, continue to innovate in new device categories in partnership with our OEMs.
Let me briefly expand on each. First in November, we released the first major update of Windows 10 with solutions designed to address critical business scenarios, security, manageability and ease of deployment. More than 76% of our enterprise customers are in active pilots, including organizations like Kimberly-Clark and Alaska Airlines, and 22 million enterprise and education devices are already running Windows 10. We're well positioned to grow our commercial device footprint in the second half.
Next, as we unify and grow the Windows 10 platform, we grow new monetization opportunities with the Windows Store, search and gaming. This holiday season, we doubled Windows Store paid transactions from PC and tablet customers. This increase is an outgrowth of Windows 10 monthly active devices all up, and the addition of new Windows 10 applications. This quarter, Netflix, Pandora, Uber, Wall Street Journal, NPR released new apps designed to take advantage of Windows 10 experiences.
For example, you can ask Cortana to recognize a song on Shazam, play a movie on Netflix or book a ride via Uber. With search, the clearest indicator of our progress is US search share, where Bing now exceeds 21%. Nearly 30% of our search revenue in December came from Windows 10 devices, partly as a result of user engagement with Cortana. We are seeing increased search engagement and monetization on Windows 10 over previous versions. This holiday, we saw record engagement on Xbox Live. Active users grew to an all-time high of 48 million across consoles and PCs. On December 28, we had more fans using Xbox Live than any other day in the Xbox history. Clearly, with Xbox One now upgraded to Windows 10, a vibrant community joined the Windows ecosystem.
Our games also performed strongly this quarter. We doubled the number of Xbox One gamers playing Microsoft published titles year over year, Minecraft concluded the holiday as the top paid app globally on Windows 10, iOS and Android, and we grew monthly active users by 18% year over year.
Lastly, we're innovating in new device categories and driving growth. With Surface, we created a new type of device, the 2 in 1, and partners are now bringing similar devices to market with success. At the same time, this was the best quarter for Surface ever with over $1.3 billion in sales, driven by the launch of Surface Pro 4 and the initial rollout of our brand new Surface Book. We see more opportunity ahead with Surface Book coming soon to China, Japan, the UK, France, Germany and other markets in Europe and Asia.
We believe in our ability to grow the Windows ecosystem. Near term, we are taking the right steps. We're also clear that long-term Windows growth and vibrancy rests on our ability to reinvent personal computers and personal computing. We accept the challenge as we see it as one of the greatest opportunities to prudently expand into new markets and generate shareholder value.
Before turning over to Amy, I want to briefly reflect on the past few months. I've had the opportunity to meet with customers from all over the globe and observe the effects of the macroeconomic trends impacting business today. Of course, any macroeconomic uncertainty will create pressures for our business. But increasingly I think it also creates opportunity for us. Every organization is looking for ways to gain efficiencies, insights and ultimately transform. This is at the heart of our mission. I believe Microsoft is uniquely positioned to empower them to find new growth areas, while finding new growth for ourselves.
With that, I'll hand over to Amy to go through this quarter's results in greater detail and share our outlook for the next quarter, and I look forward to rejoining you after to answer questions.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. This quarter revenue was $25.7 billion, down 2% and up 3% in constant currency. Gross margin declined slightly but was up 5% in constant currency. We grew operating income this quarter by 3% and 13% in constant currency, and earnings per share was $0.78, growing 11% or 23% in constant currency. We achieved strong results this quarter through targeted investments and innovation, and consistent execution.
From a geographic perspective, our performance in most markets was as expected. The key markets like Brazil, China, Japan and Russia continue to be challenging. Our commercial business once again delivered solid results, as we executed well in a large quarter for annuity renewals. Commercial bookings increased 12%, up 19% in constant currency and commercial unearned revenue was in line with expectations at $19.6 billion or 8% growth in constant currency. In addition, our contracted-not-billed balance reached an all-time high of $25.5 billion.
With our continued cloud growth, our commercial annuity mix reached 83%, up 5 points year over year. This quarter, more than 60% of customers with enterprise agreements attached commercial cloud services, up 15 percentage points year over year. Additionally, we continue to make progress in improving our cloud gross margins. In Q2, total commercial cloud gross margin was 46%, an increase of 9 points year over year driven primarily by improvements in both Office 365 and Azure.
Last quarter, I provided the expected foreign currency impact on total revenue as well as across each of the reporting segments. In Q2, the FX impact came in nearly as anticipated, though the US dollar trended stronger than expected in December. This resulted in less than 1 point of additional negative impact to total revenue as compared to expectations, rounding up to 5 points. Consistent with Q1, and as Chris explained, we're not able to provide constant currency impact at the segment level for operating expenses and therefore segment operating income. In general, FX had a favorable impact of 3% on operating expenses at the total company level.
Now let's turn to each segment's results. This quarter, our Productivity and Business Processes segment delivered in line with our expectations, with $6.7 billion in revenue, declining 2% but growing 5% in constant currency. In Office commercial, revenue declined 1%, but grew 5% in constant currency driven by ongoing strength from Office 365, where revenue increased nearly 70% in constant currency. 80,000 transacting partners sold Office 365 to small business customers, and our installed base continued to expand across Office, Exchange, SharePoint, and the Skype for Business workloads.
Office consumer revenue declined 14%, down 8% in constant currency, ahead of the consumer PC market. Subscribers increased to 20.6 million, attach rates grew and recurring subscription revenue continued to more than offset the impact of the customer transition to the cloud. And our Dynamics business grew 3% or 11% in constant currency, with triple digit installed base growth for Dynamic CRM Online for the fifth consecutive quarter.
We look forward to the upcoming launch of Dynamics AX, our ERP cloud solution built on and for Azure that increases the breadth of our offerings in the business process market. Segment gross margin declined 6%, up 1% in constant currency. The gross margin percentage declined, reflecting the increasing mix of cloud services within the segment. Segment operating expenses decreased 3% as we repositioned resources to align with our highest growth opportunities, and as a result operating income declined 8%.
The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered over $6.3 billion in revenue, slightly ahead of our expectations, and grew 5% and 11% in constant currency. Our enterprise customers continued to choose, adopt and use our hybrid cloud platform offerings which resulted in server product and services growth, revenue growth of 10% in constant currency. Additionally, Enterprise Services revenue increased 10% or 16% in constant currency, driven by our Premier Support services.
Segment gross margin grew 4% or 11% in constant currency. Gross margin percentages were flat as the rapid and continued growth of our cloud mix offset margin improvements in Azure and Enterprise Services. Given the addressable market opportunity and enterprise customer demand, we continued our investment in research and development, as well as sales and marketing resources. This quarter, operating income declined 1%.
Now to our last segment, More Personal Computing. Revenue exceeded our expectations at $12.7 billion, down 5%, and 2% in constant currency. First, our OEM results. Our total OEM business declined 5% this quarter, outperforming the overall PC market. OEM non-Pro revenue declined 3%, outperforming the consumer PC market as we expected, driven by a higher mix of premium and mid-range devices, which led to higher average revenue per license than the prior year. OEM Pro revenue declined 6%, slightly better than the commercial PC market. Pro license inventory is slightly above historical levels, which we expect to work through in Q3.
Windows volume licensing grew 3% in constant currency, with annuity growth, partially offset by transactional declines. IP licensing declined, impacted by both a decrease in total unit volume and a higher mix of low-royalty units. Our search business performed well again this quarter, with higher revenue per search, higher search volume and US market share growth, which resulted in continued profitability.
Devices revenue decreased 26% or 22% in constant currency, primarily due to phone where revenue declined 49% in constant currency, reflecting our change in strategy announced last July. Surface revenue increased 22% or 29% in constant currency, with the launch of Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book, with continued channel expansion and growing commercial sales.
On a constant currency basis, device gross margin dollars declined 18% and gross margin percentage improved, driven by a shift in revenue to our higher margin Surface portfolio. As Satya referenced, we had a good holiday for Xbox. Gaming revenue increased 5% or 9% in constant currency driven by record Xbox Live transactions as well as first party game releases. As expected, hardware revenue decreased due to lower volumes of Xbox 360 consoles sold.
Segment gross margin declined 1% or increased 5% in constant currency. Operating expenses decreased 14%, primarily due to reduced expense in our phone business, as well as a successful transition of display advertising sales to AOL. As a result, segment operating income grew 35%.
And now back to our overall company results. Customer adoption and usage of our cloud services continues to accelerate globally, and we are investing capital into our data centers and servers to respond to this demand. This quarter, we invested $2 billion, up sequentially from the $1.5 billion invested last quarter.
Other income was negative $171 million due to interest expense and net losses on derivatives, partially offset by dividend interest income and net recognized gains on investments. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 19%, in line with our expectations, with the year over year decrease primarily due to an IRS audit adjustment in the prior year, and lower non-deductible operating losses in the current. This quarter we returned $6.5 billion to shareholders, an increase of 42%.
Let's move to the outlook. I want to preface my remarks with three overall comments, and then move to more specific comments by segment. First, FX. I previously stated that we expected the FX impact on total revenue to be about 3 points in H2. For Q3, given the recent strengthening of the US dollar, we now expect an overall impact of 4 points. By segment, we expect 5 points of impact on Productivity and Business Processes, 4 points in Intelligent Cloud, and 3 points in More Personal Computing. And we anticipate continued lessening of FX impacts by segment and on total revenue in Q4, assuming current rates stay stable.
Second, our commercial business. We expect our commercial business to remain healthy with a ongoing shift to annuity as new and existing customers adopt and use our commercial cloud services. Therefore even with continuing currency headwinds, we expect commercial unearned revenue to be within the range of $18.8 billion to $19 billion. Our commercial cloud run rate trajectory remains on pass, with continued focus on gross margin improvement across each of our key services, Office 365, Azure and Dynamics Online, though the total commercial cloud gross margin percentage will be impacted by the mix of revenue.
Third, we will continue to meet global customer demand for cloud services and will increase our investment in data centers and capital equipment in the second half of our fiscal year.
Now let me share some additional commentary on each segment. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of $6.4 billion to $6.6 billion, which reflects 5 points of negative FX impact. This represents 6% year over year growth in constant currency, driven by Office 365 momentum and Dynamics Online.
For the Intelligent Cloud segment, we expect revenue between $6.1 billion to $6.3 billion, which reflects 4 points of negative FX impact. Continued customer preference for our hybrid solutions will drive sustained growth in server products and cloud services and robust demand for Enterprise Services. We expect this business to continue to grow double digits as it has throughout the first half of our fiscal year.
For More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $9.1 billion and $9.4 billion, which includes 3 points of negative FX impact. As this segment has both devices and software, I'll provide a bit more detail. First, Windows. As I mentioned earlier, we will return to normal levels of Pro inventory in Q3. And we expect non-Pro revenue to align more closely with the consumer PC market. In search, Bing will continue to gain share and will remain profitable. For phone, we expect similar year over year revenue declines, and the gross margin percentage for Q3 should look similar to Q2.
After a solid launch quarter, with Surface Book and Surface Pro 4, we anticipate continued momentum and growth with Surface Book expanding into additional countries. And in gaming, we expect normal post-holiday seasonality. We expect COGS to be $7.7 billion to $7.8 billion with variability driven by device sales. We expect operating expenses between $7.7 billion and $7.8 billion. And for the full year, we are lowering our guidance to $31.4 billion to $31.6 billion as we continue to improve efficiencies and invest in key growth opportunities.
We expect other income and expenses to be negative $300 million in Q3. This includes the net cost of hedging and interest expense offset by dividend interest income. We expect our Q3 and full year tax rate to be between 19% and 21%.
In closing, our Q2 results and our Q3 outlook demonstrate our execution discipline and our investment in strategic areas to sustain long-term growth. We remain focused as we both create new markets and take share in existing ones.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Chris for Q&A.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Amy. We'll now move to Q&A. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Philip Alan Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
All right. Thanks guys and congrats on a great quarter. I just wanted to focus in on commercial cloud and Azure specifically. I mean commercial cloud as you mentioned, the run rate was up $9.4 billion. I mean that's up $1.2 billion quarter to quarter, 70% year over year. That's a higher growth rate than even last quarter. Azure similar thing, accelerating growth versus even last quarter. Sort of a question for Satya and I'll follow up for Amy.
So Satya, when you look at the growth rates there in commercial cloud and particularly Azure, you talked about new customer wins, but also existing customers transitioning more workloads to Azure. Hoping you can give us maybe some more color there as far as what you're seeing and kind of about how you're thinking about the growth going forward there.
And then Amy, based on our calculations, it seems like Azure had a pretty meaningful improvement in just the gross margin year over year. I'm wondering if you could help us with the two curves in that business and where we are in Azure's call it gross margin life cycle, the fixed costs and the variable costs and how you're thinking about that. Thanks.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Phil, for the question. The way we think about our cloud is how I described it in my remarks, which is, it's the combination of the work we're actually doing in the SaaS, PaaS, IaaS and also our hybrid cloud layer, because we don't think for example of our servers as a distinct part. But it's in fact the edge of our cloud, and we're building for that with things like Azure Stack. So we think what we have done here by bringing these things together as one architecture for distributed computing and how people will consume applications and build applications in the future, we speak to more of the real world needs I think of an IT organization or a business organization that's trying to transform through digital technology.
I mean if you put yourself as a CIO of a organization, in a multinational organization and you want to operate in multiple geographies with different regimes for data sovereignty, and then you want to be able to take some workloads, move them all to the cloud, some you want to be able to tier with the cloud, that's the kind of flexibility we provide. And we also see network effects between if you're using Office 365, you want to extend the data in Office 365 by building applications that join it with some other data inside of our Data Lake service in Azure. Obviously Azure becomes the natural choice for such application development and we're increasingly seeing that. So that's really our strategy. Our strategy is not to compete in these constituent parts independently with different competitors, it is to bring one architecture and really drive the value for our customers because of that.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And Phil, let me quickly cover I think your gross margin question. You're right. We did actually make significant progress in both Azure as well as Office 365. And then the mix of those obviously impacts the overall commercial cloud gross margin. What's important, the dynamic's actually quite similar even though the services are quite different. There's really two fundamental components to gross margin improvement.
Number one is obviously scale efficiencies and where we are in that curve, which we are doing and continue to make consistent improvement in. The next obviously is the mix of premium services, and Satya talked about some of the increasing mix of premium services in Azure. That's been encouraging, especially in existing customers over time and through adoption curves. And Office 365, as you know, we continue to be excited by our premium mix in the commercial segment. And so those two combinations each quarter impact it as well as the overall.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Great. Thanks, Phil. We'll move to the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Excellent. Very nice quarter guys, and thank you for taking the question. Satya, you mentioned both new and existing customers increasingly using the Azure cloud. I was hoping you could give us some color into what that looks like, specifically when an existing customer starts using Azure in terms of how does their overall spending get impacted? And what happens to their spending for the more traditional server and tools? How does that get impacted as people use the Purple Cloud (34:50) utility more and more?
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Yeah, I mean the thing that we sort of notice is that with anyone who has moved to the cloud, there is a real opportunity for us to expand to multiple workloads over time, because it's a design win. It's like essentially an ISV win in the client server area, where you could get someone to build on your core infrastructure. They build their first application, and it turns out that once you've done that, you would want to look at our infrastructure for a second workload and third workload. So that's one side of what's happening with the expansion.
The other side of the expansion is what I also referenced, which is if you're an Office 365 customer, you have data in Office 365, you want to build applications that tap into that data, then you use Azure. So that's the other piece. The EMS growth is also very much related to that, which is if you deploy Exchange online, you have Azure AD and then the natural expansion from there is the full EMS suite with device management for all your mobile devices and also Advance Threat Protection and what have you. So we see both those trends from an application workload development synergies as well as infrastructure from identity management, device management work out.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Keith.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Yeah, thanks.
Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please proceed.
Brent Thill - UBS Securities LLC
Good afternoon. Amy, macro's on everyone's mind. I'm just curious if you guys could comment a little bit about what you're seeing. I know it may be too early to see some of the weakness that others have seen, but how are you looking at the demand environment? And how does that change your plans as you look sort of towards the back half of the year? Does any assumptions change in your mind?
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Brent, for the question. The geos I specifically called out obviously were we're the most impacted and they're the bigger geos. But really, I think the focus that we have here is how we can best execute no matter what the macro environment turns out to be, focus on our own execution, focus on continue to drive cloud services, focus on continue to drive annuity mix. Those movements actually and as we help customers transform, it's really the best plan in the face of any uncertainty, which you're clearly asking me about. But I tend to probably focus more on what we can control versus the external environment and how we can best react to that.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Brent. Okay, we'll take the next question, then.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Heather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Thank you very much. I was just wondering, Satya, you mentioned, and I know there's been a lot of questions on Azure, but you mentioned strong growth in compute and SQL usage on Azure being up, I think you said 5x. I was just wondering if you could give us your take on how you see the mix of Azure workloads. I mean is it right now more new workload growth and there's, it's very little existing workloads moving over? I'm just trying to get a sense for kind of how you see the wave cresting for new workloads versus existing workloads that can migrate over. And I'm also wondering if you see it helping you to take share. You mention it's kind of like a design win or an ISV win. I'm wondering if you could share with us how this might be impacting your share versus say Linux or versus other types of infrastructure platforms. Thank you.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Yeah, the thing, Heather, the move to the cloud has done for us is expanded the market opportunity that we have had more than ever before. In some sense, if you compare it to the TAM of STB versus what we now describe as intelligent cloud, we're operating in a much bigger market. And that's because first of all the move to the cloud combines a whole bunch of different categories as well as takes something that you mentioned, which is Linux. We now have the ability to take Linux workloads and run them first class and over 20% plus of Azure is Linux workloads, which was sort of a growth opportunity we tapped into with the cloud which we didn't have previously.
And even take something like EMS, which is a service you could say in the past we participated with Active Directory, but we, and some amount of system center. But now with the growth of actually mobile devices and SaaS applications, our opportunity with EMS is much bigger than anything that we had in the client server era. So clearly we are migrating some workloads and structurally, some of that helps us because we have that position in the client server space. But when we look at what we're doing in the cloud, it's mostly about attaching to one of the secular growth trajectories going forward, be it open source Linux development, mobile use and SaaS applications. So those are all things that we participate in which we didn't participate in the past.
Heather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Thanks, Heather. We'll go ahead and take the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.
Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Thank you. Satya, Amy, congrats on the quarter. So I got a question for Satya, and then a quick follow-up for Amy. Satya, following up on the cloud discussion, recognizing that SaaS, PaaS, infrastructure as a service, hybrid are all related. But as Azure continues to grow fast and become a bigger part of the business, how should we think about the opportunities or the opportunity size for PaaS versus infrastructure as a service? PaaS is much smaller industry-wide today, but is the opportunity is big, bigger? How should we think about that? And then a follow-up for Amy.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
The opportunity I believe in both cases is high, because it just comes in different forms. IaaS growth comes because people already have existing code that they want to move over, and then they start extending by writing more PaaS because it's sort of more efficient for them to write new code and new apps in PaaS. So I think that depending on what. If you're bringing something over, your IaaS will be heavy first and then PaaS will grow. If you're starting new, you will have PaaS, which is going to be the first thing you do, but then you'll always find the need to go integrate with something that was already existing, existing data, existing code in a virtual machine.
So I myself, in fact one of the things that Amy and I do, is when we think about our CapEx, we think about all these layers together. In fact we amortize our CapEx across all of these and we pay attention to margin and premium mix. Because what we have come to understand is customers, depending on where they start, how they start, have different mix profiles. So it's the all-up, as long as we're growing our premium services attach and margins for those remain strong, we feel that the mix can be different and it's okay. And we really want to speak to the needs of the customers more than any product strategy goal we have.
Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Perfect. Thank you. Amy, a slightly different topic. Free cash flow grew 25% year on year, much faster than the other metrics. How should we think about this trend continuing?
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
That was impacted, Mark, in the prior year by some integration and restructuring charges on the cash flow statement.
Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Okay. So it's really a one-time event more than anything else.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Yes, just always make sure you check the integration and restructuring in the prior year.
Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Perfect. Thank you, I appreciate it. Congrats.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.

Hey thanks for taking my question and congrats from me as well. Quick question for Satya. Now that Windows 10 is on 200 million devices, what do you see on the developer network, because one of the big aims was you have a uniform platform for developers to go against the PC, tablet, et cetera. What do you see in terms of them kind of starting to embrace the platform and use the opportunity there? Thank you.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Yeah, thanks for the question and yeah, you're absolutely right. That was one of our biggest strategic objectives was to get active devices and with Store integrated into the installed base and in the user experience so that we could increase these successful developers. And we're seeing good early signs. In my opening commentary, I talked a little bit about both the increased visits to the Store and transactions as well as the fact that we are attracting new applications from developers like Netflix to Wall Street Journal to others. And as you can imagine, our share is today in desktops, in emerging in tablets, in 2-in-1 and of course now with Xbox as well, which is you know got great attraction to gaming developers. So those are the natural places where you'll see us gain more developers and gain more traction. We are big believers in a unified developer platform and a unified Store, and then as Windows 10 monthly active devices increases and the Store usage increases, we'll see more and more developers take advantage of it.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed.
Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Hi. Just a numbers question for Amy. I noticed your long-term unearned revenue was up quite a bit. I mean that's kind of been a flattish trend and it was paired with commercial bookings being much stronger I think than I was modeling. I'm wondering if you could just help us understand what drove the unearned and how that contributed to those commercial bookings?
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Sure. A couple things Walter, which I know you recall. We do have a bit of lumpiness in our expirations. As I said on the call, this was a big expiration quarter for us. And so on occasion what that does, even with the negative currency impact on C&B, is have a bit of lumpiness over time. Now that being said, I want to point to the core, which is that renewal rates were very good, and a big quarter. There was very strong performance on that front, very strong performance in moving customers to annuity as well as to the cloud. So aside from a bit of the lumpiness that you do note and we have from time to time, the execution in the quarter was very strong.
Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
And then if I can just one other numbers question. It looks like in the Q you called out actually Windows Server declining as an offset to Intelligent Cloud growth. And I'm wondering, we haven't seen that comment in the Q before. Was there something sort of one-off driving that or any further detail on that?
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
The way I'd think about that one, Walter, is in general, our premium or enterprise workloads across Windows, SQL, System Center, et cetera, grew double digits. And so some of that weakness frankly is in the non-annuity and very transactional business, which happened to impact Windows Server a bit more than other workloads. And that is where in macro pressure on occasion shows itself first, and then some of that non-annuity lumpiness. So that's the nature of that comment.
Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Great. Thank you.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thank you. Amy, relative to your Q2 guide, the upside surprise really came in the personal computing business, and at least relative to our third quarter estimates, it's again the personal computing guidance that beat. I'm wondering if you could repeat the key factors that are contributing to the out-performance in that pretty important business? Thank you.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Sure, Karl. In Q2, let me talk about two key ones. Number one, it's really the device launches. We actually launched a very broad portfolio of devices into the quarter. With Surface Pro 4, Surface Book, Band 2 and the Lumia 950 and 950 XL. And so between all of those hardware products, as well as our gaming performance, another sort of hardware component in quarter, we did a little better than we had expected in our launches. Now when you launch mid quarter, there's always some timing aspect to that, but I feel very good about the execution of those and that is a meaningful component of that out-performance. The second one, which I talked about is OEM Pro. We did a little better in the quarter than I expected, but inventory levels are a little higher. I expect to work through that in Q2, I mean Q3. And that was a couple points of impact, for example on OEM Pro in quarter.
Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay, great. And then, Amy, for the third quarter, your guide for that business is also pretty good. Is that due to some of these similar factors? Or are there one or two others that are driving the what appears to be pretty solid 3Q performance in that unit as well?
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Well, it's similar drivers. In that segment, there's also some topics I tend to not get asked about in Q&A. Let me take the opportunity to talk about them. Which is one, our search performance continues to be very good. Frankly, our display business has been quite good. And if you go beyond that, I feel good about our gaming business sequentially. I feel good about the hardware, especially the Surface performance as we launch into more geos. And so if you think about all of those components, which actually were very similar to Q2 in terms of their strength, you see them again in Q3. And so I'm not sure there's anything quote-unquote new, Karl, I would say, other than that bit of mix between OEM Pro, a little bit pulled into Q2 versus Q3.
Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Terrific color. Thank you, Amy.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America. Please proceed.
Kasthuri Gopalan Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi, thank you very much. Congrats on the quarter. I was curious to get your thoughts, Satya, on the Windows 10 upgrade cycle in the enterprise and also the consumer market, particularly after you anniversaried the free offer for Windows 10. And secondly and finally thoughts on Surface. It's off to a great start, at least the latest model. Could that play a more important role in the corporate computing landscape? Thank you. That's it for me.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Kash, for the question. As far as the upgrade momentum, the fact that we crossed 200 million active devices, we feel very, very good about that. And the pilots, the place which in the second half is going to be a huge focus for us is the enterprise deployment, and that's where I think there's real excitement because of some of the core capabilities of Windows 10 when it comes to security, manageability. That I think is going to create great value for enterprises, and that's showing up in all the pilots. In the accelerated, I've never seen a Windows release in the enterprise with this level of accelerated deployment planned. So we obviously need to do a great job in continuing to push that, and we're focused on it.
As far as Surface, Surface is playing an increasing role for us in both consumer as well as in the enterprise market. And also we just, we created a new category of 2-in-1s where even our OEMs are finding success, which was one of our strategic objectives of doing the Surface. And so overall, we do think that this tablet that can replace your laptop is ideally suited for productivity needs, which means it's great for your personal use as well as your use inside of the enterprise, and we continue to see good growth.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
I would just add one thing, is that we've actually announced a number of important partners to help us take the Surface portfolio into commercial customers. And I think we'll expect to see progress on that over the course of the year.
Kasthuri Gopalan Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
If I could, your excitement is pretty palpable. What could be driving that 140% increase in adoption relative to Windows 7? We all thought XP to 7 was a major transition, but it looks like there's another big transition happening here.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
I mean I think there are two aspects of it. We have a good operating system release for the core desktop user, and second, I believe is that we also expand out into new usage patterns. If you look at even the thing that we're seeing is in terms of engagement, with the browser or things like Xbox Live with the Store, or new device categories like the 2-in-1, all I think make it much more possible for users to engage with Windows in more mobile formats and in more productivity scenarios. So I think it's the combination of all of that. But it starts with having a good product truth which Windows 10 does deliver on.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks very much and congratulations from me as well. Satya, I had a question on commercial Office 365. I don't know if you gave us the number, but I think the last couple of quarters you talked about monthly active users. And I'm curious if you have an update on that number. And then I also was curious about thoughts around ARPU, because you introduced the E5 SKU in December. Where are we on the path of penetration, if you will, with the higher value SKUs and the ability to see price lift across the base over time. Thanks.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Yes and Amy you can add. I mean I think, that's right, last time we talked about the 60 million monthly active users for Office 365 and that continues to grow. In fact there is always, and I think we also talked about how we get licenses sold and then, or subscriptions sold and then there's deployment. And there's always lumpiness as well as increased deployment that happens once the users migrate, and we'll continue to track that and we'll continue to disclose those numbers as they come along. But I feel very, very good in the growth of that. And I think the best proxy for you really beyond any numbers we talk about in terms of monthly active is our capital, because if you look at what we do, is we spend our capital only to really fuel the growth or to service the growth of usage across Office 365 and Azure, and you see that increasing.
And then in terms of the margin profile, I mean the entire story of having the E3 mix first to be high and now E5, that's the thing that Amy talked about, which is we now have good premium tier value in all of our products, in Office 365 that's most evident with E3 and now E5. Even in Azure, we have things like EMS, we have our data services, even our developer services. So I think all of, both of our cloud products, the major cloud products have these premium tiers that the mix shift to those or the addition of those is something that we're focused on and we see in our results
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
That's right. I would just add that we did see that premium mix go up in Office 365 on the commercial side as you were noting. And really E5's only been in market for the last month of the quarter. We're excited about the number of customers that are trying it and that all the value it offers. But I would expect that to be a longer term evolution as opposed to in Q2.
Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Can I just ask a quick follow up, Amy? That was great. Just on Windows just so we all calibrate correctly, you've had this benefit from the RPL comps from last year. Should we think about Windows really now beginning to trend in line with PC units, or can there still be some variability around that? Thanks.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Yes, in my guidance comments, I talked a little bit about that. On the Pro side as I mentioned, we'll have a couple point impact that would make a difference between that on the Pro side. And I would expect, I think we actually even talked about that last quarter, that the RPL delta which we've seen in Q1 and Q2 would go away in Q3 and Q4 and it would trend much more similarly to the overall consumer PC market.

Thank you. And our last question will come from the line of Ed Maguire with CLSA. Please proceed.
Edward Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC
Hi, good afternoon. I wanted to ask if you've been able to quantify some of the uplift since you've been opening up Office to different platforms like iOS and Android and now with the recent alliance with Red Hat, opening up a lot of opportunity to Linux developers. Have you been able to quantify how much uplift you've gotten? And how do you see this impacting your broader market opportunity?
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Let me sort of speak to it in generic terms because I don't think we have sort of quantified it as narrowly perhaps, just to address those specific moves we made. But overall, the way we have thought about it is, we want to make sure the Office subscription, both to consumers as well as to enterprise subscribers, is valuable across all their devices because it speaks to the vision that we have, which is the cloud is what enables the mobility of the human experience across all of the devices in your life. Because increasingly, there will be more devices and we want to make sure that we're adding value and if we add value in that context, you will be more inclined to retain or purchase the Office subscription. So that's been our goal and that's working well and it sort of shows up in our all-up growth.
And similarly with Azure, we're making sure that as people are tapping into the cloud and moving to the cloud, we can get all workloads to be as first class as on Azure. So that's why we've done the deals with Red Hat. We even did previously deals with Oracle. So Azure is a complete open platform where of course you can run all the Windows workloads, the .NET workloads. But we're increasingly seeing the open source workloads, the Linux workloads, the Oracle workloads, the SAPs and what have you. And more interestingly the mix of all of them because the enterprise is heterogeneous. It has been heterogeneous. We participated only in a portion of it, whereas with Azure, we can participate as the total open platform. And that's how we thought about it and that's what we're executing on.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Ed, and thanks everybody.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Yes, thanks.

Welcome to the First Quarter Fiscal Year 2016 Microsoft Corporation Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Chris Suh, General Manager of Investor Relations. Chris, please proceed.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel.
On our website, microsoft.com/investor, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provide the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Our website also includes information related to our new financial reporting segments announced in September.
This is also the first quarter that reflects the revenue recognition accounting for Windows 10. As a reminder, we report Windows revenue prior to any accounting adjustment in our More Personal Computing segment. The corresponding revenue deferral for Windows 10 sales is then reported in corporate and other in our segment reporting.
Earnings commentary today and going forward will focus on results prior to the net deferral impact as we believe this is the best reflection of business health. Unless otherwise specified, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call. The non-GAAP measures exclude the impact of last year's integration and restructuring charges and the current Windows 10 net revenue deferral. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's first-quarter performance in addition to the impact that these items and events had on the financial results.
Additionally, any mention of operating expense refers to segment operating expenses as defined in the footnotes of our Form 10-Q and includes research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative but exclude the impact of last year's integration and restructuring charges.
All growth comparisons we make on the call relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. We also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying business has performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. At the segment level we provide constant currency growth for both revenue and gross margin. However, due to the recent change in our segment reporting groupings we aren't able to provide segment-level constant currency operating expense growth, and consequently cannot derive constant currency segment operating income either. We do provide constant currency operating expense and income growth at the company-wide level.
We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission and in the transcript and any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website until October 21, 2016.
During this call we will be making forward-looking statements which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm looking forward to today's call. This quarter we delivered $21.7 billion in revenue and group profit. Also as part of our commitment to balance capital returns, we meaningfully increased our quarterly dividend and continued our stock repurchase plan.
More importantly, we are focused and making progress towards the goals for fiscal year 2018 that we shared six months ago. Now more than 110 million active devices are running Windows 10. We are well on our way to reaching 1 billion Windows 10 active devices. People are moving from needing to choosing to loving Windows.
Similarly we are making great progress towards our goal of $20 billion in annualized commercial cloud revenue run rate, which now exceeds $8.2 billion. The results speak to our differentiated cloud strategy, expanded market opportunity and the speed at which customers are adopting our service.
As I reflect on the quarter, it is important to note that we are investing in significant addressable markets where we also have meaningful differentiation. Today we'll walk through our financial results for the first quarter and discuss how we are delivering new innovation and growing users and usage across each of our three segments.
Let's start off with productivity and business process. Clearly, how people work has changed dramatically but one thing remains true, everyone wants to get more out of every moment of their life. After all, time is our scarcest commodity. That's why we set out to reinvent productivity and business process. The recent release of Office is a big step forward. We designed Office 2016 and Office 365 to take the work out of working together. We want to help change the nature of work within organizations of all sizes by focusing on the mobility of the person's experience, enabling collaboration and building a rich service that spans all aspects of how people work today.
This approach is resonating with both our consumer and commercial customers. More and more consumers are using Office across device platforms, which is driving Office 365 growth. There are now more than 18 million consumer Office 365 subscribers. We surpassed 200 million downloads of Office Mobile, more than 1 billion to-do lists have been created so far in Wunderlist and more than 0.5 billion people manage their documents and photos in OneDrive.
We continue to see strong adoption in the commercial space as well. From our largest customers, such as Kraft, GE, Louis Vuitton, to schools and small businesses around the globe. Of note, commercial Office 365 monthly active users grew to 60 million with nearly 60% of our installed base using premium workloads. And we added 50,000 new small business customers in each of the last 19 consecutive months.
As customers move to our cloud, it enables us to deliver even more value and push for new growth by entering new categories. Information protection is a great example where we have done this because of natural synergies with our existing services. In fact, nearly 20 million people already use our new premium information protection capabilities in Office 365. That's a tremendous validation of how the cloud accelerates the adoption of new workloads and grows our ability to monetize new value in the $10 billion information protection market.
The new organizational analytics market is another area where we see growth opportunity so we are investing with our acquisition of VoloMetrix, a powerful cloud-based tool for analyzing organizational productivity. The ability to visualize how people engage with others inside and outside an organization is something the cloud is uniquely suited to do. It is exciting to be on the forefront of creating a new technology category. This illustrates how our vision for productivity goes beyond helping individuals to empowering groups of people and entire organizations to accomplish more together. Our addressable opportunity will expand further as we launch more advanced security, voice and analytics workloads in our new premium Office 365 SKU next quarter.
Let's talk about business process. With Dynamics we are making great progress in breaking down the boundaries between business process, collaboration and productivity to truly empower organizations. The companies I talk with every day are under pressure to grow revenue while differentiating themselves on customer experience. It's one reason usage of CRM is growing. Dynamics CRM Online enterprise seats more than tripled year over year. Dynamics AX revenue also grew double digits as the operational system for agile business processes. And we have a new release for Dynamics NAV for small businesses that is tightly integrated with Azure, Office 365 and Dynamics CRM.
Moving to the intelligent cloud. Before I talk about the great progress we are making with our intelligent cloud platform, I want to pause and reflect on where we are as an industry. While many companies are developing commercial cloud offerings, there are really only two driving enterprise cloud platform innovations at massive scale, Amazon and Microsoft. We push each other and we each have a unique approach. Microsoft has bet on a strategy to build a hyper-scale public cloud as well as reinvent servers as the edge of our cloud. This approach gives customers a true hybrid distributed computing platform that reflects their real world needs. Our unique hybrid approach coupled with high value services is clearly a structural advantage.
It's great to see our customers like Walmart, jet.com and Alaska Airlines seize the benefits of the cloud to transform and push for growth. Azure revenue and compute usage more than doubled year over year and we are continuing to channel our innovation into high growth scenarios with new features and services. In the last quarter alone, we have made major updates spanning Azure app services for building enterprise web and mobile apps, Azure Data Lake for infinite data management and analytics, advanced threat analytics which help organizations identify breaches and threats using behavioral analysis.
CIOs are increasingly adopting our Azure premium service for security and manageability. Enterprise Mobility services has more than doubled to 20,000-plus customers. Our installed base has increased nearly 6 times year over year making EMS the largest mobility and identity management solution in a new and growing market.
Our acquisition of Adallom, an innovator in cloud security, will bring customers with ability and control over application access and company data stored across popular cloud applications including Office 365, Salesforce, ServiceNow and many more.
To be a worldwide cloud player, global scale is a must. With that in mind, we launched new data centers in India bringing our global total to over 20 regions, more than any other major cloud provider. We aren't just selling into these countries, we see the cloud as an accelerator of local economies by offering tools that empower emerging businesses, transform public sector services and create value for new local partners. Our differentiated hybrid capabilities mean customers get to choose how they adopt the cloud and distribute their workloads. This in turn is driving the growth of our server business. Premium versions of Windows Server, SQL Server and System Center all grew double digits.
Lastly, we reached a big milestone with SQL Server, one that has been 20 years in the making. The database software market is still one of the largest and now we are an unparalleled leader in Gartner's Operational DBMS Magic Quadrant. That speaks to our differentiated vision in the category and the value we deliver to customers and we are certainly not done innovating. This milestone with SQL juxtaposed with our rapid growth in Azure and its position in the cloud Magic Quadrant shows the overall strength and progress we are making with our intelligent cloud platform.
Now let's shift to progress in our More Personal Computing segment, specifically how the launch of Windows 10 is sparking new growth opportunities for the entire Windows ecosystem. As a platform company, we think about bringing the needs of multiple constituencies together, developers, IT professionals and users, and we have seen great response from all three. There are now more than 110 million monthly active devices running Windows 10. The majority of the upgrades in the first 10 weeks were naturally from consumers and are three times that of Windows 7 over the same time period after launch. We are also seeing a fast start to business adoption with more than 8 million business PCs now running Windows 10. We are adding more enterprise features and we are making it easier for businesses to buy and support Windows devices.
Our early success in attracting developers' apps and store visits is also growing. Our stores have seen 1.25 billion visits and developer revenue per download has grown four times since the Windows 10 launch. Developers are responding to the opportunity, including Facebook, which will release universal apps for Facebook, Instagram and Messenger.
Windows 10 is also driving increased usage of other Microsoft services. Specifically, Bing's share is up to 20.7% in the US and advertising revenue grew 29% worldwide, helped by Windows 10 users asking Cortana more than 1 billion questions.
Further in gaming, we have also seen an increase in active users as we extend our gaming experiences from the console to Windows 10 PCs. Xbox Live continues to grow active usage and every day nearly half of the Xbox One user base is engaged in the service. It'll be a great holiday for all gamers. The beta release of Minecraft for Windows 10 is off to a strong start, with players having already placed over 0.5 billion blocks. And next week we are excited to launch one of the most anticipated new games this holiday with Halo 5: Guardians. This new Halo includes an epic hunt for Master Chief along with groundbreaking multiplayer matches on Xbox Live. As a result, I confidently predict that time will become much more scarce for Xbox One owners starting on Tuesday.
We see all of this Windows 10 usage as an early indicator of our ability to drive growth over the lifetime of a device. Two weeks ago we took the next major step in our journey with announcement of new Windows 10 premium devices from us and from our OEM partners. It's an incredible lineup across a broad spectrum of categories from the new Surface Pro 4, Surface Book to Lumia 950, 950 XL, to Microsoft Band 2 and HoloLens developer edition. Early reviews are generating excitement with customers and we are delighted that our preorder sales are reflecting the positive sentiment in the market.
We're also seeing hundreds of new device designs from our partners, the widest range ever for this holiday. It's clear that by bringing together our applications, operating system and hardware, we will invent new personal computers and new personal computing.
Overall, I'm proud of our results this quarter and I'm optimistic about our growth prospects. We are poised to seize the opportunity of the largest technology shift of our generation with the enterprise cloud. We are increasing users and engagement in services that cross every aspect of a person's life, from Office at work to Xbox at home, while at the same time we are positioning Windows for growth. Our transformation is well underway. Quarter after quarter we build new capability, we enter new markets, scale our new businesses and new business models and we are being disciplined in our execution.
I'll now handed off to Amy to talk about this quarter's results in greater detail and I look forward to rejoining you after to answer questions.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. Before addressing this quarter's results, I want to briefly comment on the reporting segment change we announced during the quarter. We believe our new segments in combination with the supplemental metrics and the profit measure of operating incomes provide transparency into our progress against our ambitions. As Chris mentioned, my commentary today on our results and outlook will reflect the new segments and excludes the net revenue deferral impact of Windows 10.
Last quarter, we discussed the material impact that foreign exchange movement would have on our financial results through fiscal 2016. In Q1, the FX impact on total revenue was 5 points, with most of the impact in the Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes segments given their high annuity mix. This was in line with the expectations we shared in July.
This quarter, revenue was $21.7 billion, down 7% and 2% in constant currency, primarily due to the changes we've made in our phone business. Gross margin declined by 3% but was up 3% in constant currency. We were thoughtful with operating expenses, realizing savings but investing as well. As a result, operating income grew 1% or 11% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $0.67 growing 3% and growing 15% in constant currency.
We continued to see solid performance across most developed markets while the challenging macro conditions in Brazil, China, Japan, and Russia persisted this quarter.
Commercial results are now included in each of the reporting segments, therefore each quarter I will cover overall commercial results in my commentary. Our commercial business continues to be healthy, with momentum in cloud services and a higher annuity mix across all segments. Commercial bookings were slightly better than we expected and grew 10% in constant currency. We executed well on expirations and commercial unearned revenue came in as expected, growing 3% to $21 billion, up 10% in constant currency. Our contracted not billed balance was more than $23.5 billion, in line with seasonality for the quarter.
As Satya remarked, our commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate surpassed $8.2 billion, growing nearly 70% year on year and in line with our expectations. Consistent with the revenue pattern across our commercial business, we typically derived the largest volume of renewals and new agreements in June and consequently see a lower sequential growth rate in Q1. Importantly, our commercial cloud gross margin percentage improved again sequentially from Q4 as we benefited from increasing scale and efficiencies. As I will talk about shortly, our leading indicators around usage, new cloud services and customer demand remain healthy, and we are clearly on track for our $20 billion goal in FY 2018.
Now, let's turn to the detailed results of each segment. Our Productivity and Business Processes segment, which is made up of commercial and consumer Office including Office 365 as well as Dynamics delivered $6.3 billion in revenue, declining 3% and growing 4% in constant currency.
In Office commercial, revenue grew 5% in constant currency and was slightly better than we expected. Increased channel sales capacity, a higher adoption of premium services and continued installed base growth all contributed to our performance. We saw broad-based Office 365 seat growth across both large enterprise and the SMB customer base.
Office consumer revenue declined 4% in constant currency, better than the underlying consumer PC market and slightly better than we had expected. This quarter, recurring subscription revenue more than offset the impact of customers transitioning to Office 365.
Our Dynamics business grew 12% in constant currency, slightly better than we expected. Growth was driven primarily by Dynamics CRM Online. We continue to make progress by investing in product innovation organically as well as adding capabilities through acquisitions like FieldOne and FantasySalesTeam.
Segment gross margin declined 6% but grew 1% in constant currency. Gross margin percentages have been impacted by the mix shift toward our rapidly growing cloud services, including our consumer properties like OneDrive. As Chris mentioned, this year we can't provide constant currency impact at the segment level for operating expenses and therefore operating income. That said, FX in general as at the company level had a favorable impact on operating expenses, which declined 6%.
The Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes our portfolio of server products, Azure cloud services and Enterprise services, delivered $5.9 billion of revenue, up 8% and up 14% in constant currency, in line with our expectations. Our differentiated cloud platform offerings and rapid pace of innovation continue to be compelling to both new and existing customers.
Segment gross margin grew 8% or 15% in constant currency. We continue to invest in research and development resources to realize the large and growing addressable market opportunities and are accelerating our plans to add incremental sales capacity to support growing customer demand for cloud services. Segment operating income grew 14%.
Now to our final segment, More Personal Computing, which includes Windows, devices, gaming and search. Revenue was $9.4 billion, declining 17% and 13% in constant currency, mainly due to the changes in our phone strategy. As Satya mentioned, since the launch of Windows 10 in late July, we have seen solid momentum in our ecosystem and with our customers. And importantly, we saw positive engagement and usage signals across services like search and gaming that provide post-sale monetization opportunities.
Overall, our OEM business declined 6% this quarter, outperforming the PC market and better than we had anticipated, driven primarily by non-Pro OEM. As we discussed previously, this was a transition quarter as the ecosystem moves to Windows 10 and we believe overall inventory in the channel is at normal levels as we head into holiday. OEM non-Pro revenue declined 4% as we saw OEMs focused on premium devices aligned to the Windows 10 launch. This drove a richer mix to market leading to improvement in the average revenue per license. OEM Pro revenue declined 7% slightly ahead of the overall commercial PC market.
Windows volume licensing grew 4% in constant currency with annuity growth in mid single digits. Search revenue increased to more than $1 billion this quarter and we passed an important milestone as our search business reached profitability.
In our devices portfolio, revenue declined 49% and 45% in constant currency, mainly due to phone revenue which decreased $1.5 billion. As expected, Surface revenue slowed with the market anticipation of a new Surface Pro device for the holidays. Surface continues to gain ground with businesses and schools, creating opportunities for our rapidly growing partner channel which includes Accenture, Dell and HP. Both the number and size of deals in our commercial segment for Surface have increased double digits year on year.
This quarter in gaming, revenue grew 6% in constant currency. We saw growth in Xbox Live transactional revenue and our first-party game portfolio, offset by declines in hardware revenue due to lower volumes of Xbox 360 consoles sold. Government gross margin declined 10% or 4% in constant currency. Gross margin percentages were flat year over year, excluding the phone. Segment operating expenses declined 13% due primarily to lower phone expense. As a result, segment operating income decreased 4%.
Now back to our overall company results. As usage of our cloud service grows, we will continue to invest capital into our data centers and servers globally. This quarter we invested $1.5 billion to support that demand-driven growth. Other income was negative $280 million due in part to foreign currency remeasurement and interest expense. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 21%, below our guided range. This was driven by the change in geographic mix of our earnings and lower nondeductible operating losses associated with phone. This quarter, we returned $6.9 billion to shareholders, up 51%. This includes our recently announced 16% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.36.
With that overview of the quarter, let's move to the outlook. I'll start with some overall comments and then move to a discussion by segment. First on FX. Based on the current rates and the forecasted geographic mix of revenue, we expect 4 points of negative impact on total revenue in Q2. By segment, we expect a 7 point drag in Productivity and Business Processes, 6 points in Intelligent Cloud and 3 points in More Personal Computing. In H2, we expect the impact to lessen to around 3 points in total, weighted toward our segments with the highest percentage of annuity.
Next to our commercial business, which we expect to remain healthy in Q2. Our annuity mix should trend up with good execution on contract renewals and continued adoption of our commercial cloud services. Accordingly, we expect commercial unearned revenue to be within a range of $19.5 billion to $19.7 billion, benefiting from these positive trends. With the ongoing increase in cloud demand, we expect to accelerate our investment in data centers and capital equipment for the remainder of the fiscal year, expanding geographic coverage and capacity.
Now let me share some additional thoughts on each segment. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of $6.6 billion to $6.7 billion. Adjusted for 7 points of expected FX impact, the revenue growth reflects the continued momentum of Office 365 and our Dynamics portfolio. And as Satya discussed, with our new E5 SKU in Q2, we're expanding our opportunity into security, analytics and voice.
For the Intelligent Cloud segment, we expect revenue of $6.2 billion to $6.3 billion, including a 6 point FX impact. Our hybrid approach continues to drive growth in our server licensing business and robust growth in our services. Gross margin in this segment will reflect the accelerating mix of cloud services.
We expect More Personal Computing revenue to be $12 billion to $12.4 billion, including the 3 points of FX impact. Because of the mix of devices and software in this segment, let me provide a bit more context. First on Windows. Overall in Q2, we expect our OEM business to look similar to Q1 with non-Pro outperforming the underlying PC market. As we move deeper through the fiscal year, the device mix should evolve as our OEM partners produce more models at a wider range of price points. In search, we expect Bing's strong trajectory to continue, remaining profitable for the remainder of the year.
We will continue to see the impact of the phone restructuring. Revenue declines and gross margin percentages in Q2 should look similar to Q1. And with the strong holiday Surface lineup, we expect revenue to grow in Q2. Gross margins will reflect the mix of device life cycles between Surface 3, Surface Pro 3 and a growing mix of Surface Book and Surface Pro 4.
We expect COGS to be $9.7 billion to $9.9 billion, with variability driven by the device sales. We expect operating expenses between $8 billion and $8.1 billion in Q2. For the full year, we are lowering our guidance to $31.9 billion to $32.1 billion. We are and will continue to thoughtfully reinvest operating expense savings to accelerate growth in key areas, to expand our addressable market and transform how we work, to better deliver products and services to our customers.
We expect other income and expenses to be negative $300 million in Q2, similar to Q1. This includes the net cost of hedging and interest expense offset by dividend and interest income. We expect our Q2 and full year tax rate to be between 19% and 21%. Similar to Q1, this reflects the changing geographic mix of revenue as well as lower nondeductible operating losses associated with phone.
In closing, during Q1 we exceeded our own expectations across many of our businesses and more importantly, we saw healthy indicators of future growth. Through business model transitions and strategic shifts, our solid execution paired with a focus on achieving our bold ambitions has enabled us to take share in existing areas while we enter new ones.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Chris for Q&A.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Amy. We'll now move to Q&A. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and a very nice quarter indeed. I wanted to ask about the Azure in particular and the public cloud performance that you saw this quarter. It again seems like you're seeing an acceleration in that overall business and more broadly it seems like industry-wide both you guys and AWS are seeing something of an inflection point going on in terms of more and more business accruing to those public cloud environments. So my question is just that, would you agree with that statement that there is an inflection going on in the business? And if so, what do you think is causing that and is there a changing nature in how people are using that cloud? And then maybe for Amy, is there something we should bear in mind in terms of your traditional business, sort of the on-premise business that may be impacted as that inflection takes place that we should bear in mind as you go forward?
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Yeah, I'll start, Keith, thanks for the question. Overall what we have seen is the public cloud or cloud infrastructure makes it much more possible for businesses of all sizes and developers of all sizes to get at infrastructure with much less friction than ever before. I grew up in our server business in the past. We were definitely the one to democratize servers by bringing servers to small businesses. But when I think about what's happening for example in Office 365, where we are adding 50,000 small business customers who now get the most sophisticated server technology, but now as a SaaS service, that's what's really happening world over with all application categories and that's where the growth is.
I don't know long-term whether there is a zero-sum equation, but right now and in the intermediate timeframe, we see in our case growth in both sides. And in our case the vision also we have for distributed cloud infrastructure is just that, it is distributed. So we don't think of our server as a legacy business. I think of it as the edge of our cloud. If you look at what we are doing with SQL, we will have the ability for any customer of SQL to stretch even a single table from between their on-premise to the cloud. Those are the kinds of things that we are excited about.
But we clearly are seeing very rapid growth and adoption of our Azure cloud. But in our case there are two unique aspects. One is this true distributed hybrid. And second is we don't think of Azure in isolation. We think about it in the combination of Office 365, Dynamics, EMS, because really it's one cloud infrastructure first of all from a capital perspective that sort of serves all of these and there's a virtuous cycle between all of these for our customers as well.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And Keith, your second question, the place you'll actually see it will be in the gross margin percentage. As Satya said, I do expect both to grow, both the on-premise and the cloud. But I expect the mix to increasingly shift toward the cloud given its sort of robust growth rate, which will impact the gross margin percentage over time.
Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Excellent. That's very helpful, thank you.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Keith. We'll take the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.
Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Thank you. Congratulations on the quarter everyone. Two questions, but related. Let me give you the first one. The commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate grew slightly from $8 billion to $8.2 billion or a little more than each of those. You had Office 365, Azure, Dynamics CRM Online, and all of them seem to be growing very fast. How should we think about the difference? Should we figure that the run rate reaccelerates next year? Next quarter, excuse me. And then I have a follow-up.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
The way to really think about that number just because of some of the seasonality in our business, Mark, is to think about the year-over-year growth rate of 70%. For me that is more symbolic of how you should think about the pace. And that is a very fast number on a increasingly growing base.
Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
That makes perfect sense. Thank you. The second one is the cloud margins improved nicely. Given the data that's in here, it looks like they've all started to move up. Azure seems to move up. You'd said in the FAM the gross margins for 2015 (37:31) should be about 44%. How should we think about cloud gross margins for 2015? I know you don't know obviously the mix of all the cloud products, but how should we think about the improvement there?
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Mark. Looking in the old segments, I know you all have done, we saw a year-over-year improvement in the overall commercial other segment that we disclosed this time too of about 10 points year over year. We saw sequential improvement from Q4 to Q1. We're still focused on continuing to have that sequential improvement, and especially as some of the things Satya talked about, which is the addition of premium services, the pace of innovation especially on the premium end. And if you think about our launch of E5, which is a premium SKU in Office 365, it continues to give us the opportunity to both get more efficient in the infrastructure and to add higher margin products especially at the fast end.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Yeah, just one thing that's structurally I think, that we think a lot about and we're very disciplined about is our capital allows us to build all of the cloud services from Office 365 to EMS to Dynamics to Azure. And that diversity of workloads long term is what lead to margin improvement. And there will be changes in seasonality from quarter to quarter, but structurally those two things, the diversity of what we are doing and how capital is utilized across all of it is I think a big structural differentiator for us.
Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Beautiful. It's great to see that improvement happening. Thank you very much.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Thank you, Mark. We'll go to the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Philip A. Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Hi. Thanks guys, and congrats on a great quarter. Just a question for Satya then a follow-up to Amy. Satya, you talked about your good adoption of Office 365 on the commercial side both in SMBs and large enterprise. I wonder if you could just break that down and where you're seeing the faster adoption as you start to get into the enterprises, especially that might have enterprise agreements with Microsoft. How is that sales motion going and what is the pitch there?
And then to Amy, I thought this was a key point, something that we've been looking for. You noted that the subscriptions recurring business now has offset the cannibalization on the license. Is that something that we should think about going forward or was there something specific about this quarter that would push that out? Thanks.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Yeah first, as far as the Office 365 usage itself, I talked about some of the numbers of 60 million monthly active users, the fact that our seats grew 66% year over year. The small business number I talked about, the 50,000 per month additional customers that we're adding to Office 365. These are all the growth numbers and the usage growth numbers. The mix even, that information protection, I mean that's just another very important point which is amongst the customers who are using Office 365, already 20 million are using some of these premium services like information protection. And of course we're going to further expand that with new SKUs and new categories that are going to become part of Office 365. So I see that stretching on both sides, which is to small business on one end and then these premium SKUs on the other end. And we see nice attach as far as EAs to the cloud as well and that's definitely a big driver of our growth.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And so let me take the second and I'll add something to what Satya said. One of the important things that's distinct about the small business market is that there tends not to be much of a lag in terms of buying and deployment. They want to be able to instantaneously use and get value very quickly and that's something we've actually seen and a real testament to our ability to add so many customers in every quarter. And what you've seen in consumer side, which it was an important point. Once we've built this installed base up to 18 million users on the consumer side, that recurring rate does in fact offset the deferral from new, and so it is an important inflection point for us this quarter.
Philip A. Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Thanks guys and congrats.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks. Next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Heather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great, thank you. I just had two quick questions. I was wondering, Satya, if you could give us a sense for just a high level commentary about the split of IaaS versus PaaS and Azure and maybe some color on the growth you see in each of those and how you see them evolving. And then the second question would be related to the launch of Windows 10. You gave the Bing example for the month of September and the solid pull forward there, or pull along there. I'm just wondering if you could share with us any other areas where you're seeing a similar kind of pull along with Windows 10 adoption. Thank you.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Sure, Heather. On the first one, on the mix between IaaS and PaaS and SaaS, the thing that we are seeing is, quite frankly, all of these are growing but the most interesting thing for me as a pattern is growth in IaaS leads to growth in other PaaS services or SaaS services. I mean to put it very concretely, take something like Azure Active Directory. That's probably the best manifestation of the virtuous cycle that we see in any of the cloud adoption that we have, right. It could be as someone coming from Office 365. It can be someone coming from Azure, Dynamics, EMS. All of those tenants get into Azure Active Directory which is our largest PaaS service because it's got even developer API, so that means more developers are using it.
More IT professionals are using it as the control plane. So that's the network effect that we see when it comes to the PaaS services. And then in terms of infrastructure itself, as again I said, there's people who are tiering, even applications people who build hybrid applications where the storage could be even on premise in some cases, but the mid-tier and the web and the mobile back ends are in the cloud. We see a lot of growth there. We see a lot of growth in our data, both in terms of infrastructure but in the new services like our Data Lake services which are PaaS services. Hadoop is another good example. We see lots of Hadoop usage inside of IaaS but we also see HD inside growth. So I would say there is a real good mix of those two.
And then on Windows 10, I mean I'm very, very excited obviously about what's happening with Bing. I think Amy talked about we have a $1 billion quarter with 29% growth and good share position growth in the United States. That's fantastic to see. But gaming is the other place where we talked about Xbox Live now that spans both console and PC. We see increased engagement because of that. We see in fact increased engagement with titles like Minecraft. So we have some high hopes for what we can achieve with engagement around Xbox Live across the console plus PC.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Thank you, Heather. We'll go to the next question, please, operator.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please proceed
Brent John Thill - UBS Securities LLC
Good afternoon. Satya, Michael Dell mentioned with you on stage a week ago that he's seen from his perspective stronger Windows 10 adoption among enterprise customers faster than he had seen in the past. And I'm curious if you're starting to see a halo impact where those that are looking to move up are saying we want to go with more of the complete infrastructure set? And are you seeing different sales motions among those enterprise customers as those customers are coming back to you?
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Brent. I mean that is absolutely the fact, case, that is we are seeing a much faster adoption cycle, obviously starting with the consumer side but even the 8 million business PCs that are already running Windows 10 before we have started in fact the push on enterprise. We expect the enterprise deployment to start in earnest the beginning of next calendar year or the second half of this fiscal year. But to your point, the fact that there is pull already is a very, very good indicator of, and a good sign, and it's even better than what we saw with Windows 7.
And so to me that's all positive news, and but yet we're very, very focused on delivering I think new value to the enterprise customers. Because if you look at Windows 10 we've already talked a lot about all the consumer value. But just take security itself, I think that Windows 10 represents a real breakthrough in terms of security on the endpoint as well as in embedded, which we are really excited about in terms of driving the enterprise upgrade cycle.
Brent John Thill - UBS Securities LLC
Real quick just for Amy on cash flow, is there anything that we should take into account this year versus what happened last year?

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.
Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Beside Azure in the intelligent cloud, you obviously have very, very good momentum on the classic server and tools business. Can you talk a little bit about the volume versus price effect that you see playing out here and how is it now and how do you expect that to play out going forward? And one of the things on Azure was usage, and you mentioned how that kind of improved quite significantly. Satya, can you talk a little bit where you see that current usage standing and where do you think that can go? We obviously didn't get a number, just a growth rate. But where do you see usage? Because that's obviously one of the things that one of your competitors keeps talking, trying knock on you. Thank you.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Yeah, I mean I think the usage number is the one that, Raimo, that we talked about, which is doubling of compute, doubling of storage. We talked about the growth of our EMS, which is a higher level service. We talked about the growth in Active Directory. So we have usage growth in Azure which is very, very healthy.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And on the server question you asked at the beginning, let me say that we did see I think around 9% constant currency growth of the core server product, and a lot of that was premium driven. Now, I have a distinction between a price question that you sort of asked versus seeing the value of a premium SKU. And so I do think it was premium driven as opposed to sort of a price driven in particular.
Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Perfect. That's helpful thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thanks very much. I wouldn't mind going back to Windows 10. Three months ago on the June quarter call, the messaging was that Windows 10 would not likely lift Microsoft's performance results until the second half of fiscal 2016. Yet it feels like as early as this first quarter, it's creating a lift at least to the Windows OEM business. And I just wanted to understand what's changed in the last three months such that it's having an earlier than expected positive impact on Microsoft. Thank you.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Karl. Why don't I take that and Satya can add. In particular what we saw this quarter was really as much about the mix of the devices that the OEMs are bringing to market as it was in the absolute unit distinction. And you saw that in the non-Pro revenue performance. And so for us I think really the way to think about the early signs of the impact were the strong device mix, some higher priced units across a wide variety of OEMs as we build into holiday, did provide some slightly better than expected results, as you noted in the non-Pro business. But really some of the other upside that we saw in the quarter was from things that are the second sort of derivative of that, which was our search results were better than we had thought. Because of some of these results about where the PCs were upgraded and the pace at which they were upgraded.
And so I do think we are encouraged, as Satya said. But we're a quarter in. And I think what's exciting for us is really the opportunity we have going forward. We're excited about Q2 when the devices hit the shelves. We're excited to have so many first party devices in Q2. And then the next stage after that which is really the enterprise deployment, which as Satya mentioned, we expect in the second half of the year. So it's early, but you're right, we did see some incremental improvement over what we expected.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed.
Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Hi. Thanks. Amy, I'm wondering if you could talk about on the computing side, the personal computing side, you talked about this quarter seeing growth ahead of the PC market. You alluded to a diversity of devices coming in the second half. How do you think about that variable in the model say beyond this sort of launch period where you have a little bit of a differing mix going on in devices and you get to more of a steady state out in kind of years two and three of the Windows 10 launch? Do you think you can grow ahead of the PC market? Or do you think – I know for the last few years you've grown below the PC market. Just wondering how we should think about that.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Walter. Let me talk a little bit about what I said in my outlook. This quarter, as I just talked about, the non-Pro outperformance versus the market was really due to a higher revenue per license. I expect that actually to continue in Q2. I expect our overall Pro business to remain in line with business PCs. Once we work through sort of the end of XP bump, that really should be in the line. And as we talked about, as we move through the year, I do expect things to more normalize overall in terms of RPL comparisons. But I do think that's probably the best way to think about the curve over the course of the year.
Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
And then on the commercial licensing part, specifically within productivity, I know you sort of had an old breakout and a new breakout where we don't see commercial licensing necessarily within Productivity. But would you expect that piece, the commercial licensing within Productivity given the transition going on to be stable? Or would that decline as you see the transition over to the cloud in Productivity specifically?
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Let me try and if I missed the question or misunderstood it, you can help me again. I think you're asking about our core Office commercial business, the product side versus the service side.
Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Correct.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And really, okay good. The trend we saw there, as I said, we're 5% up in a constant currency basis. That was 70% cloud minus 8% on prem. That's a trend that's not new for us. We've thought about making this transition as quickly as possible, but what we're seeing, which you heard us talk about, was a transition to increasing premium mix, selling more workloads, doing all of that while we're growing the installed base.
So if you think back to how we've talked about the long term, the lifetime value equation, it's those components that I really think about proving out over time, and we had lots of encouraging signs about that. New users, Satya referenced on the small business and mid-market side. Premium mix, we talked about how many premium services we're now selling. And then in terms of renewals, they're quite good, which we talked about. And so I think all of those, when you talk about should we expect the traditional business to be in decline, I don't think that's new. I think what's important is our ability to switch it to the services and add more over time that really I focus on.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yes, thank you very much. Amy, I see the commercial bookings numbers in the KPI sheet, but I do not see the total bookings numbers. I'm wondering if you could just comment on that so that we can try to maintain a consistent analysis there if it's relevant. And also, Satya, now that SQL Server has taken over this number one position in the Gartner Quadrant for the database market, could you help us understand how the roadmap evolves from here? As we did notice Amazon made its debut also in the leader's Quadrant, and I think we're trying to understand how the movement to cloud platforms like Azure could further alter the database landscape and how you could capitalize on that.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Why don't you go first.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Yeah, I'll go first. I think the data architecture that underlies what's happening in the enterprise underneath applications is going through a dramatic change. That said, the relational database itself remains still a very strong component, but not the only component anymore, in both on-premise and off-premise. And what we want to make sure as a company is to cover all of that landscape with a very rich data platform. So if you look at what we're doing, the length and breadth of our ambition as well our delivery today, everything from what SQL itself is doing, we have now all in-memory workloads for OLTP, BI, data warehousing built in. We have the ability to now tier even the database with the cloud. This is all the things that are coming in SQL 2016 and we're excited about that.
When it comes to the cloud itself, we have a PaaS service with SQL, which is very unique in terms of SQL Azure. We have now the Data Lake service for basically petabyte, exabyte scale data management. We have higher level data services like Azure ML, which is about advanced analytics, a category we didn't even participate in the past. So we've entered that category, Revolution R fits into that.
So we have a very rich story and this is not even talking about some of the other end-user BI capabilities like Power BI. So I think we have a very rich vision and execution on what is an expanding data platform opportunity. And it's nice to see us innovate on the new services while we also in what is still the big market, which is the relational database market, claim a leadership position.
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And Mark, on the total bookings number, the reason we moved to commercial bookings is it's a far more comparable number to look at period to period. Total bookings, because the volatility frankly in consumer businesses in times like the holiday periods, it can make it far more volatile than usually what many of you have been asking for, which is the continuity and health of the overall commercial business. If you want to get to total bookings, you just add back in all the consumer revenue, is technically is how you would do it. But I do think the more helpful KPI for us in terms of bookings is the commercial one.
Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thank you.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Great. Thanks, Mark. Operator, we'll have time for one final question, please.
Operator
Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks so much for squeezing me in and congrats on the quarter. Amy, I just had a couple. The first one, just your comment that the consumer Office business you're seeing, basically the subscription revenue now being larger than the offset, if you will, the license side, where do we stand with regard to that on the commercial side of the Office transition?
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
The way to think about that how is I look at – well, the way I would generally say it is you look at each of the KPIs we give. So the Office commercial business grew 5%. It was negative 8%. If some transition earning back off the balance sheet, the total cloud is 70%. When we start to get to this point and the percentage we already have in the cloud, it is really an offset. And that's probably frankly been true a little bit longer than we talked about technically in terms of what goes off and what comes on given we've now got, as Satya said, 60 million users and more than that in terms of seats sold. Now that can technically, Ross, be interesting in certain quarters of the year where we have very heavy expirations. And so it just depends year over year, but that's why the commercial is slightly harder to do it on because there's some volatility in the ins and outs based on seasonality.
Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Just if I think about the incremental subscription revenues from the commercial side versus the license declines, it sounds like this year, this fiscal year, we're making that pivot like we have made on the consumer side. Would that be a fair statement?
Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.
I want to make this simple and unfortunately it's just slightly complicated. Because so much of our installed base was already on an annuity contract, it makes the transition mathematically hard. I think what you're asking is specifically for a transactional component when the old transactional component has gone. But it's a very hard – but that's a component of the number, not the total. So it's why it's technically difficult to answer the question you're specifically asking, Ross. But the way I would think about it is we are moving such a substantive piece of our EA business and with our annuity mix all up in commercial, up to 86% percent, we're feeling very good about our ability to transition people at LTV and grow the business overall at a very high level.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.

Welcome to the fourth quarter fiscal year 2015 Microsoft Corporation earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I'll now turn the conference over to Chris Suh, General Manager of Investor Relations. Chris, please proceed.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me today are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel.
On our website, microsoft.com/investor, is our financial summary slide deck, which is intended to follow prepared remarks and provide the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP measures exclude the impact of impairment, integration, and restructuring charges, and are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's fourth quarter and fiscal year performance and the impact of these items and events had on the financial results. The non-GAAP financial measures provided above should not be considered a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Unless otherwise specified, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call.
All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. For selected metrics on the call and in other earnings materials, we have provided growth rates in constant currency. We present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuation.
Additionally, any mention of operating expense refers to segment operating expenses as defined in the footnotes of our Form 10-K and includes research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative, but excludes the impact of impairment and integration and restructuring charges.
We will post the prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website until July 21, 2016.
During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainty. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, we will share the results of the final quarter of the year and our optimism for the year ahead.
We delivered $22.2 billion in revenue this quarter and $93.6 billion total revenue for the fiscal year 2015, an increase of 8% year over year. We pushed forward in our transformation by focusing our investment in areas where we have differentiation and significant opportunity for future growth in large addressable markets. We galvanized around our mission and ambitions. We aligned our structure to deliver better products at a more rapid pace. We focused our advertising business on search. We focused our mapping efforts on higher-level experiences and development services. We restructured our phone portfolio so that we can operate more efficiently near term while driving reinvention long term. We invested more in new mobile applications like Wunderlist, Acompli, and Sunrise. We also strengthened our enterprise cloud platform by acquiring Revolution Analytics, Datazen, and BlueStripe in this quarter alone. And we are at the threshold of the Windows 10 launch.
I'm proud of these steps and I'm proud of the results we delivered in tandem. In cloud alone, our annualized commercial cloud run rate surpassed $8 billion this quarter, and the revenue grew 88% year over year. We are on a strong trajectory towards our goal of $20 billion in fiscal year 2018.
With that as the backdrop, I want to walk you through the progress we are making in each one of our three ambitions. Let me start with reinventing productivity in business processes, including our efforts across Office 365 and Dynamics. We continue to see strong demand for Office 365 and Dynamics products. We now have more than 15 million Office 365 consumer subscribers, and customers are signing up at a pace of nearly 1 million per month. In addition, we surpassed 150 million downloads of Office Mobile on iOS and Android and have introduced a new version of Office for the Mac.
In the commercial space, the number of Office 365 users continues to climb, with seats growing 74% year over year. Office 365 now is in four out of five Fortune 500 enterprises, and more than 55% of the installed base is on premium workloads. It is clear that we have success moving customers to the cloud, given half of all the enterprise agreement renewals were for Office 365 this quarter.
Small and medium businesses offer one of our best opportunities for new growth in the cloud. In fact, for more than a year now, we have seen 50,000 new SMB customers adopt Office 365 every month.
Last week at our Worldwide Partner Conference, we announced our new Office 365 Premium SKU for business, E5. Now our customers will get rich new voice functionality in Skype for Business with Cloud PBX and PSTN Conferencing, deep analytics with Delve analytics and Power BI Pro, and advanced security features such as lockbox and advanced threat protection. With E5, we have expanded our market opportunity for Office 365 by more than $50 billion. This new E5 SKU and the launch of Office 2016 will drive one of the biggest new businesses for us.
Let's now turn to CRM. This market alone is $20 billion-plus and has massive opportunity for reinvention. Mainstreaming Dynamics into our engineering sales and marketing efforts gives us the ability to participate in this large and growing market in a more meaningful way.
Last week we announced the acquisition of FieldOne, which helps strengthen our Dynamics CRM customer service offering. This quarter, total paid seats for Dynamics CRM online increased 140% year over year, and we have more than 8 million paid Dynamics seats across CRM and ERP in total, up 25% year over year. This creates a great foundation for future growth in our Dynamics business.
Next, I want to share our progress in building the intelligent cloud platform with Azure. Again this quarter, we have seen proof that preference for our cloud staff services creates a flywheel of growth for our cloud platform services. In Azure, both revenue and compute usage increased by triple digits year over year. We tripled our revenue from Azure premium services this quarter. In the enterprise mobility services, we now have 17,000 customers.
Appeal for Visual Studio Tools has grown to include developers beyond our traditional base with some of the decisions we made to embrace open source with .Net and support across platform development. Since November, we have seen more than 5 million downloads of Visual Studio Community, the fastest ever adoption of a Visual Studio product. Visual Studio Online continues to gain momentum, with over 3.1 million registered users.
Business intelligence and analytics is another large, rapidly growing market for us with an opportunity of more than $15 billion. We are focused on strengthening our offers in this space. Just last week we announced the availability of Cortana Analytics Suite, our fully-managed big data and advanced analytics solution. We're not only building the tools but are also delivering the insights customers need to transform their businesses.
Security is a key priority for our enterprise customers and another $30 billion market opportunity for us, and we are building capability to meet customers' need. For example, we've made significant investments in security with Azure Key Vault, enabling customers to protect data in the cloud with secure key management and encryption customers can control. We have four new certifications for Azure, bringing our certification and at the station total to 22 globally, more than any other cloud platform today.
Our third bold ambition is to create more personal computing experiences with Windows and our devices. I am thrilled we are just days away from the start of Windows 10. It's the first step towards our goal of 1 billion Windows 10 active devices in the fiscal year 2018. Our aspiration with Windows 10 is to move people from meeting to choosing to loving Windows. Based on feedback from more than 5 million people who have been using Windows 10, we believe people will love the familiarity of Windows 10 and the innovation. It's safe, secure, and always up to date. Windows 10 is more personal and more productive with Cortana, Office, universal apps, and Continuum. And Windows 10 will deliver innovative new experiences like Inking on Microsoft Edge and gaming across Xbox and PCs, and also opens up entirely new device categories such as Hololens.
Windows 10 will deliver significant value to enterprise customers as well. Windows 10 provides advanced security capabilities with additional features for hardware-based security, mobile work and data protection. It also provides a single device management platform across all devices, from phones to laptops to Internet of Things devices. And Windows 10 helps enterprises stay up to date with Windows Update for Business and Windows Store for Business.
While the PC ecosystem has been under pressure recently, I do believe that Windows 10 will broaden our economic opportunity and return Windows to growth. First, we have an OEM ecosystem that is creating exciting new hardware designs for Windows 10. In fact, our OEM partners have over 2,000 distinct devices or configurations already in testing for Windows 10 upgrades as well as hundreds of new hardware designs. We are delighted that the first of these exciting new devices will start to be available on Windows 10 launch day, and by this holiday we will be selling the widest range of Windows hardware ever available.
Second, we will generate new growth through gross margin on our own differentiated first-party premium device portfolio. We will also significantly reduce our losses on the phone by operating more effectively and efficiently with a more focused portfolio.
Third, we will grow monetization opportunities across the commercial and consumer space. In the enterprise, customers will continue to value our unparalleled management security, app dev, and servicing capability. And for consumers, Windows 10 creates monetization opportunities with store, search, and gaming. We are confident that these are the right levers to revitalize Windows and restore growth. The progress we made this quarter and the forward-looking guidance that Amy will share shows the opportunity for renewed growth is real.
In hardware, both Surface and Xbox had an incredible Q4. We more than doubled Surface revenue to nearly $900 million this quarter, capping off a year in which it delivered more than $3.6 billion in revenue. Both consumers and enterprise customers love this device. Surface is clearly a product where we have gotten the formula right, earned fans, and can apply this formula to other parts of the hardware portfolio.
Gaming is an important scenario for Windows 10, and our success with Xbox this quarter gives us a strong starting position heading into launch. Xbox Live users grew 22% this quarter and logged nearly 3.5 billion hours of gameplay. Our growing fan base is excited for the best games lineup in our history. All of this comes together with Windows 10, when fans can connect with each other, stream all of their Xbox One games to Windows 10, and experience the best virtual reality platform given our partnership with Oculus Rift and Valve.
In search, Bing will now power both differentiated experiences on Windows 10 such as Cortana as well as search and search advertising across the AOL portfolio sites in addition to the partnership we already have with Yahoo!, Amazon, and Apple. With advertising revenue growth of 21% year over year, Bing will transition to profitability in the coming fiscal year.
It's been a strong year of progress. Above all else, I'm optimistic about our future. Our cloud services are accelerating fast, and Windows is positioned for renewed growth.
With that, I'll hand it over to Amy to talk about this quarter's results in more detail. I look forward to rejoining you after that for questions. Thank you.
Amy Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks and good afternoon, everyone.
Our fourth quarter results demonstrate the strong progress that we've made as a company over the past year. Key strategic initiatives such as cloud, first-party hardware, and consumer services delivered significant growth as well as improved profitability.
Commercial customer renewals remained healthy with strong adoption of cloud services and a higher mix of annuity than we expected. And our disciplined approach to resource allocation has allowed us to increase investment in the growth initiatives Satya mentioned while reducing the company's operating expenses. This allows us to better compete in markets with structural growth where we feel we have unique competitive advantages. With that said, I will start with an overview of our financial performance before moving into a more detailed discussion of the results.
This quarter we recorded an impairment charge related to our phone hardware business and incurred integration and restructuring expenses. Additionally, like most multinational companies, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar continues to have a significant impact on our reported results. Accordingly, when applicable, I'll give results and growth rates adjusting for the impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses, but also in constant currency to help you better understand the underlying business fundamentals.
Revenue was $22.2 billion, down 5% and down 2% in constant currency. As a reminder, last year included $382 million of revenue that we recognized at the conclusion of our commercial agreement with Nokia. Significant gross margin improvement across commercial cloud, Surface, and our consumer services helped to mitigate the impact on gross margin from the decline in D&C licensing. Total gross margin declined 7% and 3% in constant currency. Operating income declined 3% and 1% in constant currency. Earnings per share were $0.62, growth of 11% and growth of 8% in constant currency. Unearned revenue grew 1% to $25.3 billion and 7% in constant currency. Commercial unearned was better than expected, as we saw a higher mix of annuity in the quarter.
From a geographic perspective, the majority of markets performed in line with our expectations. The notable exception was Brazil, where inflation and macroeconomic volatility weighed on our performance. Overall, macro conditions remain a challenge in some large opportunity markets like China, Russia, Japan, and Brazil. There was slightly less impact from currency than our expectation.
With that backdrop, I'll move to a detailed discussion of our results. Q4 last year effectively marked the end of the XP refresh cycle. It impacted our Windows OEM and non-annuity volume licensing as well as our Office non-annuity volume licensing results. During that time, OEM revenue exceeded that of the underlying PC market, driven by a higher attach of Pro, particularly within the developed markets. This quarter Pro declined by roughly 21%. And similar to last quarter, we saw Pro attach remain at pre-XP levels, even with the underlying softness in the business PC market.
The annuity portion of Windows licensing grew again on a constant currency basis, with non- annuity revenue declining due to XP. Windows non-Pro revenue declined 27%, as OEMs tightly managed PC inventory ahead of the Windows 10 launch, particularly in developed markets. In our view, this is a healthy state for the channel as we head into a transformational launch that starts next week.
Consumer Office 365 had another strong quarter of net subscriber growth. Overall, consumer Office revenue results reflected the decline in the underlying driver of that business, developed market consumer PC sales. Within D&C licensing, the transition to Office 365 accounted for 13 points, and the impact of Japan's PC market accounted for another 19 points.
We had another impressive quarter in search, with revenue growth of 21% and 25% in constant currency, driven by increases in both volume and revenue per search.
As Satya said, revenue from Surface more than doubled this quarter, with continued strength of Surface Pro 3 and the launch of Surface 3. Enterprise sales accelerated this quarter, and sales of Surface 3 were particularly strong to educational customers. Our differentiated products as well as improved discipline and execution helped to improve gross margins by $450 million this quarter and $1.3 billion in fiscal 2015.
Within Xbox, strong growth in consoles, online transactions, and first-party games helped to drive revenue growth of 27%. This progress as well as the excitement we generated at E3 with Xbox exclusive gaming content and backwards compatibility demonstrates the building momentum that exists within the Xbox ecosystem.
In phones, we sold 8.4 million Lumias, which is an increase over last year's full-quarter sales. ASPs, however, have continued to decline. Gross margin declined this quarter, driven by lower per unit margins on Lumia devices as well as reduced volumes in non-Lumia phones.
As announced on July 8, we are changing our approach in this business and are focused on delivering differentiated experiences for our targeted customer segments while improving our operating results.
Moving to our commercial results, total revenue across our two segments grew slightly in USD and 4% in constant currency. Our contracted-not-billed balance, which is a key indicator of customer commitment, reached an all-time high of over $24.5 billion, and it reached this level even with the significant appreciation in the U.S. dollar. Constant currency bookings were flat to the prior year, though as a reminder, last year commercial bookings grew 23% on the strength of a large renewal base as well as the end of XP, discussed earlier.
Our Office commercial business continues to transition to Office 365. We again grew the installed seat base for Office, Exchange, SharePoint, and Skype for Business. Office 365 allows us to have a deeper ongoing relationship with all of our customers, which in turn provides us with the opportunity to expand and grow our business over time. Because of this transition as well as weakness in Japan and the impact of XP, Office commercial products and services grew 1% in constant currency, quite similar to Q3.
Dynamics revenue grew 15% on a constant currency basis, driven by the strong CRM results Satya talked about and our ERP business, which saw 35% growth in customers this quarter.
Server products and services grew 4% and 9% in constant currency, continuing to outperform our peers in the enterprise software sector. SQL Server share growth continued, as customers value its high performance and lower cost of ownership. Revenue and licenses of Windows Server grew against the backdrop of a declining server hardware market; and in the public cloud space, yet another quarter of significant Azure usage growth. Additionally, we significantly grew the gross margin percentage in our commercial other segment, increasing 13 points to over 43%.
Moving to operating expenses, which declined 9% or 4% in constant currency, our continued disciplined approach has allowed us to incrementally fund strategic initiatives without having to increase our expense base.
Other income was favorable to our expectations, driven by gains on foreign currency and sales of investments.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24% and was at the high end of our guided range, due in part to strong performance in our computing and gaming hardware segment in the U.S.
We returned $6.7 billion to shareholders this quarter, nearly double the amount from last year.
With that overview of the current quarter, let me turn to our outlook, starting with a few overall comments. As has been communicated over the past couple of months, the accounting for Windows 10 will change. We will be deferring a portion of Windows 10 revenue, primarily OEM, and recognizing it over time, generally two to four years. As shared previously, the initial deferral and the subsequent recognition of those deferrals will be netted in Corporate and Other in our segment reporting. Most importantly, underlying billings and cash flow won't change. Therefore, our commentary in this and subsequent earnings calls, including our guidance, will focus on results prior to the net deferral impact, which we believe is the best reflection of business health.
With that background, let me share some thoughts on fiscal 2016. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar will continue to have a significant impact on results over the course of FY 2016, assuming rates across our largest currencies, the euro, Japanese yen, and the British pound, stay in line with current rates, and that the geographic mix of revenue stays as forecasted. In our non-annuity businesses, the impact is immediate as the revenue is recognized in quarter. In our annuity business, revenue is deferred and the impact is delayed as we earn the revenue off the balance sheet.
In total, we expect FX will negatively impact total revenue growth by five points in each quarter of H1, with seven points of negative impact in our commercial segments. H1 would be the peak of the FX headwinds. And in H2, we expect FX to have three points of negative impact in total and roughly four points of negative impact on our commercial revenue. With Windows 10, we expect momentum to build throughout the year, as we and our partners bring new devices, applications, and services to market. We expect this to benefit our business results in the second half of the fiscal year.
With the strength in Xbox and Xbox Live along with the launch of Halo 5 in October, Xbox will continue to grow both fans and profitability.
With the recently announced changes in phone, there will be significant revenue declines year over year in the phone segment each quarter. With the proactive measures we've taken to reduce our cost structure, overall losses will also decline for the fiscal year. We would expect the majority of that improvement in the second half of the year once the restructuring efforts are materially complete. Bing will be profitable in FY 2016. And assuming the macro environment is stable, we expect that our commercial momentum will continue, highlighted by growth in our commercial cloud. We remain on track to achieve our $20 billion commercial cloud ambition in fiscal 2018.
We now expect operating expenses to be $32.1 billion to $32.4 billion, which is lower than the guidance we provided in April. The lower guidance reflects the savings from our restructuring of the phone business as well as important investments to drive top line growth as we support Windows 10, our first-party hardware efforts, as well as sales head count to accelerate our leadership position in the commercial cloud. We expect our full-year tax rate to be 24% plus or minus one point, excluding the net impact from the Windows 10 deferral.
Now to Q1, starting with Devices and Consumer. In licensing we expect revenue to be $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion. This range reflects Windows revenue roughly in line with the PC market. Within Consumer Office, we expect to transition to Office 365 subscriptions to continue. In computing and gaming hardware, we expect revenues to be $2.0 billion to $2.1 billion. As a reminder, we launched Surface Pro 3 in late June last year, with launch benefits extending into Q1. As far as hardware, we expect revenue to be approximately $900 million, reflecting our change in approach. We expect gross margin in phone to improve sequentially in Q1. In devices and consumer other, we expect revenue to be $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion, with continued growth in Bing, Consumer Office 365, and Xbox Live transactions.
And in commercial, as I discussed previously, we expect a significant FX headwind this quarter. Our constant currency growth is expected to be about 7% in Q1, which assumes we continue to take share in key markets and build momentum in the new areas we have entered. With the negative impact of FX, we expect revenue to be roughly flat.
On commercial licensing, we expect revenue of $9.1 billion to $9.2 billion, with a continued shift to annuity; and in commercial other, with the significant growth in our cloud revenue of $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion.
We expect COGS to be $7.0 billion $7.2 billion, with the variability being driven by the hardware segment. We expect operating expenses to be $7.6 billion to $7.7 billion. As a reminder, other income and expense includes dividend and interest income offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging. Given the current FX environment, we expect our net cost of hedging to increase and other income and expense to be negative $200 million.
Excluding the Windows 10 deferral and the impact of foreign currency, we expect the sequential decline in unearned to be slightly better than historic seasonality, driven by the growing mix of annuity revenue.
In closing, I'm proud of the tremendous amount of progress that our company has made over the past year. We've improved how we operate in virtually every sense. These changes have allowed us to aggressively invest in areas that will drive future growth for the company. I'm looking forward for a better position to capitalize on the significant opportunities ahead of us.
With that, let me turn it back over to Chris for the Q&A.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Thank you, Amy. We'll now move to Q&A. Operator, please repeat your instructions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Our first question comes from Phil Winslow from Credit Suisse.
Philip Alan Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Thanks, guys, and congrats on a great quarter. I just wanted to double-click on Office 365. You guys showed another huge quarter of growth in terms of your consumer seat count, and I think it was 86% growth on the commercial other side for Office 365. I'm wondering if you could just drill into both the consumer and then enterprise side, just the trends you're seeing there. And obviously the guidance you all just provided, it looks like you expect those trends to continue in Q1, so any color there would be great.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Yes, I'll take that. Overall, we are very excited about the growth we are seeing in Office 365. On the consumer side, as you noted, we are growing 1 million subs a month, and that's fantastic growth for us. The consumer value, especially now that we have even all the endpoints covered with Office, the definition of Office and where all it's present is also changed, and that all accrues to consumers being willing to have a subscription relationship with us.
On the enterprise side, the growth remains very exciting for us, and the growth comes in multiple forms. It comes in the form of just the EAs renewing more to Office 365. It also comes in the form of some of the more comprehensive suites, the E3 and the new E5. That's the commitment we are seeing. And we also see small businesses. I talked about the 50,000 businesses, small and medium-sized businesses each month signing up for Office 365. That's pretty unprecedented. Having been in the server business all my life, I've never seen a lot of the small business customers adopt some of the rich capabilities like it's possible now, and that's great growth as well. And that cloud revenue number that is the 88% is all up cloud revenues inclusive of Office 365, EMS, and Azure. And it's good to see that kind of growth at that kind of scale now with $8 billion.
Amy Hood - Microsoft Corp.
One thing I would add, Phil, to that is an important dynamic that we're seeing in Office 365. As we are having this momentum build, in fact we talked about some of the new customers we're adding, and the way we see that is the install base growing. And we were able to see that this quarter across all the core workloads in Office. And when you think about why that's so critical long term, it's our ability to sell some of the workloads Satya actually referenced that will be in E5 when it launches. They have the capability of upgrading on a more consistent basis using more of these premium services. So when you can both add to your install base and add overall market opportunity, we do feel good about our line of sight in that business for our long-term goals.
Philip Alan Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Great. Thanks, guys, and congrats again.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Okay, thank you, Phil. We'll take the next question now, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Brent Thill from UBS.
Brent J. Thill - UBS Securities LLC
Good afternoon. Satya, the server business continues a steady outperformance and, as Amy pointed out, better growth than your peers. I guess a couple questions as it relates to the Windows 2003 retirement and any impact you're seeing there. And then secondarily, if you could, just comment on some of the new product launches. It seems like there's a stack of new solutions that are coming on the server side that look pretty exciting. Your partners are excited about it. If you could highlight what you see as the most interesting from your perspective over the next several quarters. Thank you.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Overall, I'd start even with the bold view that my server business is not a legacy business. We fundamentally think about servers as the extension of the cloud. I even describe it architecturally as the edge of our cloud. Every server, for example, has things like disaster recovery, backup, and tier-ing with the cloud. And so we will continue to push that differentiation because I think that view architecturally and the delivery of it is what makes us pretty unique. And you see it in the numbers. Our servers even this quarter grew 9%. And compared to the industry peers, we're obviously gaining share with Windows Server, on SQL Server, and pretty much all of our management and security products as well.
And going forward, we have a fantastic lineup of servers, not just the infrastructure, but even SharePoint, Exchange, Lync Server continues to have significant on-premise deployment. So as our cloud continues to grow, obviously, we are getting where there is more capability in the cloud. We're incenting customers and our partners to move to the cloud. But at the same time, we are going to have a great server wave. I'm excited about our SQL product. I think it goes into the first preview next – in fact, tomorrow. And that product I think is a pretty revolutionary product because for the first time you can take a single table in a database and you would tier it with the cloud, and that kind of capability only we can provide, and that's something that I'm looking forward to.
Amy Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And, Brent, to your specific question on Windows Server 2003, we did have a good quarter, as we talked about, in Windows Server. But in general, that business, unlike the quiet upgrades that we see, just because so much of the business is already on annuity, you don't see that type of incremental impact in an in-quarter release. That isn't to say there isn't ample opportunity for us to make sure we upgrade customers to the higher-value product and more secure and more manageable offerings we have in the server business.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Brent. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.

Our next question comes from Mark Moerdler from Bernstein Research.
Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Thank you, nice quarter. I want to drill in, in terms of the move to the cloud. This quarter the year-over-year server product and services revenue growth was slower than it was in the past quarters. How much of that is because you're seeing now some revenue shift to Azure, or is it not yet seeing any revenue shift going? And then I have a follow-up question.
Amy Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Why don't I take that one, and we'll see what Mark's follow-up is? At 9% growth and continuing to take share, I feel like our performance in this continues to be a positive outlier to the peer group. And for me, that type of performance in double digits for the year, I still feel quite good about.
In general, what's interesting I think is you're getting to the crux of it is do we have incremental workloads that are unique to the cloud. We continue to see that. The very best example, frankly, as Satya mentioned in his comments, which is our EMS performance, Enterprise Mobility Suite offerings. It's taking something that's very unique, builds off of our core in the server business, and allows us to both grow and add new perspective there. So I don't think of it as reflecting a bigger shift than we've seen in particular this quarter. Also, if you'll remember, a year ago we had a very big base of expirations in Q4 and had very strong performance a year ago. So I don't look at it as a direct trend line.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
The only thing I'll add is when I look at the total growth of Azure, the growth that's coming now from some of the premium services, these are businesses that we actually did not ever participate on premise at all. Even EMS, when I think about our management, our management was just about Windows management. But we now have management data protection and identity systems that cross all devices in the enterprise, including the Internet of Things, and that makes it pretty exciting. And that growth is great to see.
Same thing on server management, we have a new suite called the Operations Management Suite, which also spans all the cloud units as well as on-premise units. Cortana Analytics, we never participated in any of the advanced analytics workloads at all in spite of all the success we had in the database business. So I'm excited about built new workloads that in many cases are born in the cloud workloads where we are expanding our market opportunity and continuing to outperform our peers and grab share when it comes to on-premise.
Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
That's very helpful. Switching gears a bit, on Windows, obviously you're seeing some amount of delay due to Windows 10 on the OEM side. Can you give maybe a little more higher color in terms of how you're thinking about that, how big a delay is it, how much we could see that starting to be replaced next quarter and beyond?
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
I'll take that and, Amy, you can add to it. The way the Windows ecosystem works is there are phases to it. And in fact, if anything, this release of Windows 10, just the way we have built it with the Insider program, everything is of course speeding up because in some sense we've taken a very different approach with this Windows-as-a-service even when it comes to OEM relations and how they're able to co-create the products with us.
But that said, there are three distinct phases. The first phase is what I will describe as the upgrade phase. That's what starts in a week's time, and that is a more retail execution and upgrade. Then come the fall, you will see the devices from all the OEMs going into the holiday quarter. And then the enterprise upgrades; in fact, we have a release of enterprise features, which I mentioned in my script, which will ship in that timeframe. And I expect piloting to start and deployments to start in the second half of the fiscal year. So that's how I would think about the OEM as well as enterprise adoption. So my bullishness for Windows 10 is more in the second half of the fiscal year, and of course it will build. It will build starting in a week's time in retail and in the upgrades, but I see this in three phases.
Amy Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And to your specific question, Mark, before every launch we tend to have a tightening in the channel as they prepare and run reasonably lean. This is a healthy state. It's within the range of normal. So I don't think of it as a delay in the way you're talking about it. It is pretty standard in fact, as Satya talked about, in terms of the dynamic. And he mentioned we are feeling I think a lot of excitement from the ecosystem about what's possible with some of the new devices that will come. And so I don't really think of it in that way. I think about it as an encouragement that they want to fill the channel as quickly as they can over the coming quarters with new machines.
Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Thank you, I appreciate it.

Our next question comes from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley.
Keith E. Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Excellent, nice quarter, guys, and thank you for taking the question. I wanted to drill into the new strategy around the phone business a little bit. The revenue expectation for Q1 I think was below our expectations and I think a point below what the Street was looking for. Can you give us a sense of how you see that business trending over a longer period of time? Because there is a significant restructuring going on and I think – I would think a lot of guys have a good view in their head of what your expectation is for this business on a revenue run rate basis? Or what do you expect to be selling this year on a going forward basis is right now?
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Let me start and then, Amy, you can add to this. The big shift that we are making when it comes to phones is to not think about phones in isolation. That's perhaps the biggest shift because I think about Windows 10 in its entirety, the Windows ecosystem in its entirety. We clearly are going to have premium first-party portfolio, and you've seen some of the numbers, some of the progress we have made in Surface. I feel that we have a formula there that I would like to apply more broadly in terms of growing, just delivering innovation, growing our own economic return for it, stimulating demand, creating categories. All of that is what I want to do broadly. And it applies to phones, it applies to Surface hardware, it applies to Hololens, and that's how I view it.
I believe our participation in the phone segment by itself with Windows phones and Lumia phones being there is important, and that's why we picked the three areas where we have differentiation and we want to focus on it. We're going to have great flagship phones for Windows 10. That's actually a segment we don't today have good devices, and we hope to change that with Windows 10. We have in fact good traction in the business segment. This is business customers who are actually buying phone devices, which is basically a radio with essentially a smartphone to be able to deploy their line-of-business applications. That's where we have pretty unparalleled value, which is we have Visual Studio Online and some of the tools I talked about, so you can generate these apps at a low cost of ownership, manage them, secure them, and deploy them to our phone endpoints, and then of course, management and security. So that's a place where we want to continue to focus.
And in the value smartphones, that's the place where I want us to be much more efficient. We clearly have some value to add there because of the uniqueness of Office and Skype and our services. But at the same time, I think we want to be smart about how many of these phones do we want to generate, how many, which price points we want to participate. That's where you will see the most significant operational changes from how we operated last year to the coming year.
Amy Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And so, Keith, the way that I think about it and I tried to outline it in my comments is that the significant revenue declines quarter over quarter through the year are a reflection of the focused approach we're going to take in phone. It's an approach that we've executed in other hardware segments that I feel is a proven model for us. Our profitability will also improve. More of that comes in the second half of the year structurally as we complete some of the restructuring efforts and those costs come out of our operating expense run rate. But I think that's probably the way to more appropriately think about over time you expect to see gross margin improvement and operating profit improvement as opposed to focusing on the revenue line.
Keith E. Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And if I could sneak one more in just on the security side of the business, I think a lot of guys have thought traditionally about security as something that Microsoft does to make their platform more secure, and it does provide more confidence in users using your platforms and your tools. On a going-forward basis, is there more of an opportunity for you guys to sell security as more of a standalone opportunity? It's something that's in very high demand today with those looking for more secure solutions. Is that something that could potentially be more of a standalone opportunity for Microsoft on a go-forward basis?
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
In fact, we are adding significant value in security. It's much better for us, for example, to add capabilities. There are no (46:55) 365 in security, and that's all in, for example, this new suite that we have just announced called E5, the secure lock box. That's actually a pretty – a very cool set of features that allow both regulators and businesses to have, for example, audit ability and control over their movement in the cloud. Similarly Azure, where we launched a whole set of security offers around how people can encrypt and manage keys. So those are all security features. We bought a company in Colorado that's essentially a firewall on all your identity management.
So when we talk about enterprise management suite growth, a lot of it is just obviously is management growth, but it's also security and data protection growth. So the approach we're taking is we are essentially creating, to your point, security value around our products, which allows us to participate in essentially a security market that we never did in the ways that we are. So it's more than just launching one point security product. It's much more broadly participating in the security market, and you have seen some of that in the inorganic moves and the suites we have created.
Keith E. Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Excellent. Thank you, guys.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.

Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard from Citi.
Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Hi. Amy, just for you on the annuity, it looks like annuity was about 82% of the commercial revenue for the last two quarters. How high do you think that goes? It sounds like you do expect that to continue to go up, although it probably never gets to 100%.
Amy Hood - Microsoft Corp.
I do think over the long term you're right. That is how I think about it. And frankly, inherent in the conversation around moving to the cloud with the aggressive targets we've given, that is implied, to your point. And so I think 100% is not the logical answer. There will always be somebody who chooses to purchase on a one-time basis, or there's a logic to it. But I do think over time, we do expect that to trend in that general direction.
Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
And then, Satya, you mentioned CRM in your comments, your prepared comments, which we haven't really heard you talk that much about as an area of interest in the past. I'm wondering. What changed in your view, or how do you look to bring that into it sounds like more the core productivity scenario that you deliver?
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Overall, business process collaborations, communications, these category boundaries are things that I believe are going to change. I've always felt that in some sense, most of the time we even automate business processes, but we spend really getting our business done in our communication and collaboration tools. And this impedance is something that I've always dreamt of how do we go forward. And CRM has taken our own Dynamics product, has taken some pretty unique approaches. And quite frankly, I was the one who opened up our communications and collaborations for other CRM vendors.
One of the things that I'm very explicit about is we will have an open platform for other business process applications because it's a very fragmented market the world over, especially if you add SMB. And so we want to be having a platform play as well as our own business applications play, and both of them should be high-growth for us. And in the last year, we just added more focus and we put more selling capacity around it, more marketing capacity, and now for the mainstream that's across Microsoft because I'm a big believer in this because I think we have something unique to add. As opposed to driving our own top line/bottom line growth, I think we can bring real innovation, and that's what is exciting to see.
And it's not just CRM. I'm actually excited about our ERP business. Some of the numbers that Amy talked about is growth in the seats. And when I think about data as the new currency, we have lots of managed seats and a lot of data which all will move to the cloud. And so things like Power BI and Cortana Analytics can help customers transform. So in fact, that's one of the reasons why we have been very optimistic about some of our new data capabilities because we have the attach capability go out even in the install base of Dynamics.
Amy Hood - Microsoft Corp.
And, Walter, just quickly, this is one of the areas that we have invested in actually leading into this past fiscal year, FY 2015. And the results have actually been better than we anticipated when we first made the investment. So I think we both feel very good about the momentum that's built through the year.
Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Great, thank you.

Our next question comes from Karl Keirstead from Deutsche Bank.
Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hi, thanks, a question for Amy on the cost control front. It looks like you once again came in below your OpEx guide, but I think the COGS number came a little bit above what you had guided to three months ago, and I'm just wondering if you could talk through that. Obviously, it affects everybody's gross margin calculations. Was it the hardware mix shift? Was it the challenges with the phone business? Perhaps a little color there might help us. Thank you.
Amy Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Sure, Karl. Because of the performance in Xbox and in Surface, you're right, it is a hardware mix shift a bit. We outperformed significantly in both those products in Q4, and that took us a little bit outside the COGS range but not as much as our revenue outperformed. So actually, margins structurally were better than I thought they would be. And so I actually feel quite good with that outperformance and our ability to see that outperformance fall to the bottom line through stronger executional gross margin percentage, particularly in that segment.
Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay, good. That's helpful, thank you.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.

Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays.
Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to go back to Azure. You obviously have strong momentum there. Can you talk a little bit about the use cases you see from the enterprise and SMB customers? Is this very much a test and development situation, or are you thinking of broader adoption there as defined by obviously Office 365, et cetera? Thank you.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
At this point, I would say it's pretty broad even use cases for even enterprise customers. There's definitely dev/test happening. There is production IaaS infrastructure-as-a-service deployment given some of the new high-performance SKUs and storage options that we have. And we've seen significant adoption of SQL, so this is Azure DB, machine learning-as-a-service. One of the things that we realize is as every company out there becomes a software company, beyond even our traditional reach through IT, everyone has a digital office inside the company. They are, in fact, doing things in advanced analytics and using machine learning, and that's a place where we have some very unique capabilities. So that's another place where we're seeing wide adoption.
We are seeing adoption in the building of new front ends, back ends for new front ends, so essentially using Azure as the cloud back end for their mobile apps across Android, iOS, and Windows as well as their web. That's another use case that's high growth for us. And of course, Cortana Analytics; this is the big data side of it. This is happening in IT. It's happening, as I said, in digital offices within each one of the customers. So we have a pretty broad spectrum of use cases. And some of the customers have talked about it in their recent set of conferences, from our Partner Conference to our Ignite Conference. We have been in fact showcasing; even our ad campaign showcases some of these use cases.
Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Perfect, thank you.

Our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.
Heather A. Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great, thank you. I just had two questions, pretty quick ones. Just to follow up on Azure, I was wondering if you could share with us what you're seeing in the mix between IaaS and PaaS and how you've seen that shift evolve over the last few quarters.
And then secondly, just to follow up I think on Walter's question, yes, you've definitely been focusing on the customer relationship management opportunity and the financials market more. But given the big SaaS incumbent already competing in that area, can you share with us? Do you think you have the assets you need internally to execute against your long-term goals?
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Sure. On the IaaS with the SaaS, it's an interesting question. I've not looked at it in isolation, because what happens is at least the use cases, what starts off as IaaS suddenly will start using Azure AD for identity management, will use a little bit of our media services, for example, just doing content and encoding. So there's a mix always. So there's nothing pure PaaS, nothing pure IaaS. That's the trend I see, but it's a split that we should go take a look at and then offline maybe even talk about it. But overall, we see significant amount of IaaS in the last year, because that's probably the place where we had more of a weakness which we have now overcome. And so we're seeing significant growth of IaaS in the enterprise. But the place where we continue to have significant differentiation is in some of these managed services and PaaS. And that I think is the mix on it.
And then on the Dynamics side, I absolutely believe we have a huge opportunity. Having worked in business applications for a long time, first of all, the market is very fragmented. I think people like to talk about leaders, and there are clearly leaders when you go to the very top of the enterprise customers and segments. But the way the market splits into verticals and into horizontals and then the platform affects it, there's plenty of opportunity. For sure, you've got to be one of the players. It will be three players, four players, whatever, but in every technology paradigm, you want to be one of them. We already have a $2 billion-plus Dynamics business. I talked about the total number of seats. And now we have this triple-digit CRM online growth. So I feel that we are in a good position. And I feel that things – we'll look at and even some of the inorganic means to keep growing it. In fact, the field service acquisition I talked about in my script is an example of that. So that's my bullishness on our business process prospects.
Heather A. Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.

Our next question comes from Ross MacMillan from RBC Capital Markets.
Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks for taking my question. First on OpEx, the guidance, Amy, is impressive. I presume that fully accommodates the restructuring announced two weeks ago. And then last year, you said core Microsoft ex-NBS would be down slightly in OpEx. I wondered if you could provide a similar comment for fiscal 2016 for core Microsoft ex-phone.
Amy Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Sure. Look, I talked a little bit about it, but let me go into a bit of detail on that. I think the first half of your question was does the $32.1 billion to $32.4 billion full-year OpEx guide reflect the timing of the implementation of our restructuring, and it certainly does. And so what you can then see, relating to the second half your question, is that we are taking some of those savings and investing them back into the business in some of these key growth areas we've seen. I outlined three on the call. The third one I probably could have expanded more on.
The first one is Windows 10. The second is the first-party hardware, where we just had such terrific performance again this Q4. And then finally, the third bucket was about accelerating our commercial cloud lead. And I do feel like in that area, we could invest in Office 365 some of the new E5 capabilities and look forward to adding sales capacity to take advantage of that. We'll also add sales capacity across some of the other opportunities we've seen broadly. And so I look and see that as an opportunity to accelerate top line growth.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
And one thing I would just add because a lot of folks even ask about our business process and business applications, I want to build a long-term profitable business. In other words, one of the keys in business apps is you can always get into the trap of overspending in sales and marketing and not having long-term leverage at all. One of the things I feel very good about our position is how do you really build a long-term profitable business; that's front and center to me. So we will not overspend there in sales and marketing because we do believe the products – in fact, there is a different way to sell even business process applications because of the cloud, and that's something that we want to take advantage of.
Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC
And I had have one quick follow-up, if I could. That's helpful. At Analyst Day you did talk about – I think it was 8% unit growth in the Office ecosystem over the last three years. And it sounds like you continued to see nice unit growth in Office. How should we think about that going forward? Are you fully expecting to continue to see unit growth?
And then also just a clarification, I think your customer lifetime value was based on existing SKUs. So as you introduce E5 and others, does that open up the potential for even higher customer lifetime value? Thanks.
Amy Hood - Microsoft Corp.
Great. I do think the work we showed at the analyst meeting on the importance of increasing the install base across Office and Exchange, that it did occur again this quarter. So I feel good that we're staying on the trajectory that we showed in the projections. I do continue to expect that to happen, as we shared back that last week in April.
On the second half of your question, I tend to think you're right. Generically, each of the examples was quite different. There were people that were upgrading from X to Y. There were people that were just simply moving to the cloud. But one of the things that the cloud, to your point, makes fundamentally possible is the opportunity for us to quickly iterate the opportunity's billed value and deploy it more quickly to customers. Generally, I do think that they will pay us for that, to your specific question. I also think the importance of it is that it tends to also come with higher margin. So our improvement and continued improvement in our commercial cloud gross margin portfolio, I think this is a key criteria of that. So I associate it, yes, with lifetime value, and I also associate it with our ability to move our gross margin percentage up.
Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC
That's great, thank you.
Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Ross. We have time for one last question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our last question comes from Daniel Ives with FBR Capital.
Daniel H. Ives - FBR Capital Markets & Co.
Thanks, just one last one just on M&A. Maybe you could just talk through the change in the strategy. Obviously, given what's happened with the Nokia write-down, the security acquisition going to Pivotal-Cisco year, how you're thinking about M&A in the scheme of everything, especially as you guys have been pretty tight on cost controls and everything else. Thanks.
Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.
Overall, again, the way I look at it is, first of all I'm most focused on obviously our organic growth. And in there, Amy alluded to this. We've made significant changes in how we've allocated our own organic dollars, both in R&D as well as in sales and marketing. And we'll continue to do that because I think there are significant new opportunities for us to go after, and that will require us to reallocate aggressively, and that to me is core. But beyond that, we will look at inorganic means. When I look at all the acquisitions that we have made over the course of last year and our OpEx guidance for next year shows how disciplined we are in bringing new talent in, be it in R&D, be it in sales and marketing.
So we are not afraid to bring in new capability, but then also questioning what is the allocation we have. Of course, we have done smaller acquisitions, but they add up. They're pretty significant when you add up all the things that we have done in the Office 365 space, all of the things that we have done in the Azure space. So we'll continue to do that. And if anything comes up in M&A which allows us to pursue our strategic vision that we will need to even allocate more to on an OpEx basis, post-acquisition we will look at that. So I won't shy away from it because what's important to us is growth in areas where we have something unique to contribute and long-term profitability.
Daniel H. Ives - FBR Capital Markets & Co.

Greetings, and welcome to the Microsoft Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
At this time, I’ll turn the call over to Chris Suh, General Manager, Investor Relations for Microsoft. Thank you, Chris. You may begin.
Chris Suh
Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me today are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel. On our website, microsoft.com/investor, we have posted our press release and a slide deck that provides a summary of our results this quarter.
Unless otherwise specified, all growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year. For selected metrics on the call and in other earnings materials, we have also provided growth rates in constant currency. We present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations.
Additionally, any mention of operating expense refers to segment operating expenses as defined in the footnote of our 10-Q and includes research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative but excludes integration and restructuring charges.
We will post the prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today’s call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website until April 23, 2016.
During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are pretty predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today’s earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Satya.
Satya Nadella
Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I’ll focus my remarks on our three business areas: Cloud, Windows and Devices. Next week at Build, our developer conference, I’ll share more about our ambitions and how our next-generation platforms will empower every person and organization.
This quarter, we delivered $21.7 billion in revenue, an increase of 6% year-over-year or 9% in constant currency. We are seeing the impact of foreign exchange, geopolitical trends in certain geographies and product transitions. We’re taking steps to respond quickly and adjust our plans as needed while we continue to move forward in our transformation.
Overall, I’m pleased with our business performance. More importantly though, it’s clear that we are well on our way to transforming our products and businesses across all of Microsoft. The early signs are evident in how our customers are using our products, which I’ll share throughout my remarks today. Our momentum in the cloud is a highlight. Increasingly, customers are choosing Microsoft cloud services to transform their own businesses, going beyond just moving existing workloads to the cloud. These results showcase our ability to transform and perform simultaneously.
With that in mind, I’ll walk you through the quarter, starting with our Cloud business. At the core of our results this quarter is incredible growth across a growing portfolio of cloud services. Our commercial Cloud business is a source of strength driven by Office 365, Azure and Dynamics CRM. Our commercial cloud annualized run rate now stands at $6.3 billion, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of triple-digit revenue growth.
Office 365 is clearly a key growth driver. Like any cloud service, we track how people are actually using it and we are proud that Office 365 is a vibrant, active service. Right now, there are nearly 50 million Office 365 monthly active users inside businesses. Exchange Online alone sees about 60 billion requests per day from all connected clients, about 70 billion transactions or user actions and there are 830 million meetings a month created in Office. And we’re increasing our Office value proposition for businesses with new mobile device management capabilities built into Office 365 and through our continued commitment to customer data compliance and security.
We released new versions of Office Dells for mobile devices, and earlier this month, we rolled out Skype for Business to the Office 365 customers worldwide. Finally, in anticipation of the release of Windows 10, we have announced a preview of new touch-first Office universal app. Small and medium-sized customers are adopting Office 365 at a continued rapid pace, led by our more than 65,000 Office 365 partners. Thirty telecommunications companies are already offering 365 to small and medium-sized customers, including some of the largest in the world. In Q3, we announced a new partnership with T-Mobile to bring Office 365 to more customers and enhance the partnership with GoDaddy.
At Build next week, I’ll talk to you even more about Office as a platform and how developers can connect into the Office framework to both harness the rich data and have their own application extensions available to ultimately a billion plus Office users. Azure is also seeing impressive usage momentum. Right now, more than five million organizations are represented in Azure Active Directory with more than 425 million identities. Storage is also a strong indicator of consumption, and now, we have 50 trillion objects stored in Azure, a 3x growth year-over-year in storage transactions, more than five trillion in March alone. And Azure websites are growing with nearly half a million sites hosted.
Beyond strong usage of our existing services, we are excited by the customer response to our expanding portfolio of new cloud offerings. In particular, Enterprise Mobility Suite is growing and we now have more than 13,000 enterprise customers using EMS. And as customer adoption and usage in the cloud increases, more developers are choosing Azure for the applications. Nearly three million developers are signed up for Visual Studio online, up 2x year-over-year. To foster developer innovation, we launched Azure App Service this quarter. It offers a powerful set of development tools for creating web and mobile app backends for any platform or device while enabling integration with other applications, including Office 365, Dynamics, Salesforce, Facebook, Twitter, SAP , Oracle, Siebel and many more.
We also delivered new Azure compute instances this quarter with more memory and storage than any other public cloud provider, attracting more mission-critical workloads to the cloud. And we improved our Big Data capabilities with support for the latest version of Hadoop and LINUX in HDInsight and improved disaster recovery with Azure Site Recovery and Backup . We’re seeing significant customer interest and adoption in Azure Machine Learning and Azure Stream Analytics , in particular, for IOT scenarios.
In a world where every company has the opportunity to become a software company, a diverse set of companies like ThyssenKrupp , Toyota, Rockwell , Ford, Fujitsu and Millay are engaging with us in their transformation.
Further, our Dynamics business also has traction in the enterprise. It is now nearly a $2 billion business. Dynamics CRM online enterprise paid seats more than doubled year-over-year, and we more than doubled enterprise seats sold this quarter for ERP. We also announced a wave of innovation in Microsoft Dynamics CRM this quarter with new social, mobile and analytics capabilities for business process transformation, including seamless integration of Dynamics CRM with Office 365.
While our commercial Cloud business is expanding dramatically, we’re also seeing strong growth in our consumer cloud services. Office 365 consumer added an average of one million new customers per month and we now have more than 12 million subscribers, an increase of 35% over the prior quarter. We’re clearly taking Office everywhere. Core to our mobile first strategy is to ensure that our service endpoints are on every mobile device, and to that end, we have seen continued momentum with more than 100 million downloads of Office on iPhones, iPads and Android tablets. And with the release of Outlook on iOS and Android this quarter, updates through our OneDrive application and a preview of the forthcoming Office for Mac, we’re making Office available to even more users on more devices.
Bing achieved a significant milestone this quarter when U.S. search share topped 20% and search advertising revenue grew 21%. Search is key to productivity in work and life and it’s a huge opportunity for Microsoft as we continue to innovate with Bing across our applications and platforms. On top of that, I’m pleased with our renewed partnership with Yahoo! and our combined ability to compete more effectively in the search marketplace. Our investments in innovation and user experience in Xbox Live are paying off. Xbox Live users grew 18% year-over-year, helping drive increased Xbox Live usage growth by 30%.
When I step back and look at Office 365, Bing search and Xbox Live collectively, I see real usage growth and monetization of our consumer services all up.
Now let’s talk about Windows. To start, our Windows revenue from business customers is stabilizing post the XP refresh anniversary, coming back in line to historical levels. We’re also transforming the consumer Windows business to adapt to the changing market dynamics, including lower price point devices. This quarter, while non-Pro revenue declined, activations were up. Importantly, we are now at a place where we can start to see early signs of how usage increases in services like search and gaming can drive new monetization opportunities over the lifetime of a Windows consumer device.
Windows is a tremendous asset for Microsoft, with more than 1.5 billion users. This means every day, hundreds of millions of people are using Windows and Windows applications. In fact, more than 60 million unique apps are used on a monthly basis from PCs running Windows 7 and later. We are focused on making Windows 10 the most loved version of Windows ever. Perhaps most importantly, last quarter, I talked about how Windows 10 will be a service across an array of devices and will usher in a new area era of more personal computing, an era where the mobility of the experience, not the device, is paramount. We look forward to sharing a lot more about Windows 10 at Build next week.
In our device portfolio, service adoption continues across enterprise and consumer customers, with 44% revenue growth year-over-year. And 64% of Surface Pro 3 users use OneNote, nine times that of any other touch laptop. This shows how great hardware innovation influences customer experience and usage. We’re looking forward to Surface 3 availability next month, a device that has received positive reviews for being a superior versatile device at a lower price point.
We continue to demonstrate momentum in the Value Smartphone segment of the phone market, driving 18% growth in Lumia volume this quarter. However, we need to take further action to reduce our costs across devices as we execute on our Windows 10 first-party hardware plans.
I’m excited that next week, I’ll be able to talk much more extensively about our ambitions and the opportunity ahead to two important audiences – developers at Build and our investor community at the Financial Analyst Briefing in San Francisco.
Before I turn it over to Amy, I want to close by reflecting on Microsoft’s transformation to a company that will thrive and help our customers thrive in a mobile-first, cloud-first world. This is a new world with new growth. It’s a world that requires fundamental transformation in products, business models and delivery models across Microsoft. In 2008, we started our transformation by taking an iconic franchise, Office, to the cloud. We took the next big step towards forwards five years ago when we launched Azure and another step forward with the recent announcement of Windows 10 as a service. Microsoft’s overall transformation isn’t about one-for-one shift. It is about delivering new value to more customers and unlocking new growth opportunities. To do this, we will continue to push forward with big ambitions and persistence while delivering solid performance.
With that, I’ll hand it over to Amy to talk about this quarter’s results in greater detail, and I look forward to rejoining you after to answer questions. Thank you.
Amy Hood
Thanks, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our execution in the third quarter. In our Commercial business, we continued to see healthy underlying fundamentals with strong renewals of volume license annuity contracts, a mix shift to cloud offerings and solid bookings. Importantly, you can see the progress we are making in the execution of our cloud strategy as the percentage of our revenue from annuity contracts in our Commercial business continues to rise.
As Satya highlighted, we also saw momentum in strategic businesses we’ve been investing in, such as Bing, Xbox Live and Surface, which have a key role in our plans to further monetize Windows devices. Like most multinational companies, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar has had a significant impact on our reported results. Accordingly, when applicable, I will give growth rates in both GAAP and constant currency to help you better understand the underlying business demand.
Revenue was $21.7 billion, up 6% and 9% in constant currency. Gross margin grew 1% and 4% in constant currency. We improved gross margin percentage year-over-year in each of our segments again this quarter, reflecting our ongoing focus on operational excellence. Operating income declined 5%. Adjusting for both integration and restructuring expense of $190 million, as well as the negative $87 million impact from FX, operating income declined 1%. Earnings per share was $0.61, which includes a $0.02 negative impact from FX and $0.01 of integration and restructuring expense.
As a reminder, FX movements first impact our bookings growth and unearned revenue on the balance sheet. Each quarter, our contracted not-billed balance is adjusted to reflect current FX rates. When FX rates move rapidly, as they have in the last six months, bookings growth can be significantly impacted. This was the case again this quarter as bookings grew 2%. However, when measured on a constant currency basis, bookings grew 9%. Unearned revenue was up 4% year-over-year to $20.2 billion and 7% in constant currency. Total unearned revenue was slightly below expectations, driven primarily by a stronger-than-expected mix of sales that are recognized in the current period.
From a geographic perspective the U.S. outperformed our expectations. This relative strength in the U.S. resulted in roughly one point less of constant currency impact than we expected in our Commercial business. China, Russia and Japan were generally in line with our expectations.
I want to touch briefly on what we were seeing in Japan, given it’s our second-largest market from a revenue perspective. Revenue was down $550 million, which is nearly four points of growth for the whole company. With high Office attach to PCs, revenue is particularly sensitive to the underlying PC market dynamics. Q3 was the toughest comparable due to both XP end of support and the VAT increase which went into effect last April 1. The impact is most evident in our DMC and Commercial Licensing segments. The macroeconomic climate remains challenging as well in Japan and we don’t expect this to change in the short term.
With that backdrop I will now moved to a detailed discussion of our results, starting with Windows. Q3 last year was the peak of the XP refresh cycle, evidenced by Windows Pro revenue growth of 19%. This growth significantly outpaced the underlying PC market driven by higher attach of Pro, particularly with large enterprise customers in developed markets. This quarter Pro revenue declined by 19% and is essentially flat to our Q3 FY 2013 levels as both business PCs and Pro mix in that segment returned to pre-XP refresh levels.
For Windows non-Pro as we talked about last quarter, inventory in the channel was higher than normal. This quarter activations grew and we exited Q3 with channel inventories at more normal levels. This channel inventory reduction was the main driver of our Windows non-Pro revenue decline. We continued to see a mix shift opening price point PCs which impacted license mix and aggregate ASP. However, it was significantly less than the impact in Q2 when holiday sales favored lower price point PCs.
Office consumer revenue and D&C licensing was down 41% this quarter due primarily to the shift of purchasing toward Office 365 Consumer where we now have 12.4 million subscribers. This transition to Office 365 accounted for 27 points of that decline and the impact of Japan’s PC market the remaining 14 points. Excluding Japan, we grew our combined consumer Office licenses by 10%.
Revenue in our Devices and Consumer Other segment grew 25% and 28% in constant currency, exceeding our expectations. Many of our growth efforts are represented in this segment and we made terrific progress this quarter across Office 365, Bing and Xbox Live transactions. Gross margin expanded again, benefiting from the increased scale in our services. Inclusive of the estimated impact of the Yahoo! agreement reached last week, we remain confident in our goal of Bing profitability in FY 2016.
Moving to hardware, revenue from Xbox consoles declined largely due to a mix shift of Xbox One consoles to lower ASP SKUs, as well as the impact of launch supply from a year ago. With Surface we saw 53% constant currency revenue growth driven by strong retail sales and attach of accessories. On phones we sold 8.6 million Lumia devices and have gained share in key markets such as the U.K. and Germany over the course of the year. Gross margin declined sequentially, driven by lower Q3 revenue and approximately $60 million of negative impact from foreign currency relative to Q2 FX rates.
We’ve made significant progress in reducing the operating expense base in the Phone business, moving from an annualized rate of $4.5 billion at acquisition to a run rate under $2.5 billion. That said, the changing mix of our portfolio to the value segment and the significant negative headwind from FX will impact our ability to reach operational breakeven in FY 2016. In response we have in Q3 and will continue in Q4 to aggressively focus on our operating cost base by pursuing efficiencies in both COGS and operating expenses. We will focus those efforts across our entire first party device portfolio, even while we expand into new form factors such as Whole Lens and Surface hub.
Now moving to our commercial results, where revenue grew 5% or 7% in constant currency. Commercial bookings declined 1% on a reported basis but grew 10% in constant currency. The underlying health of the business remains very strong despite the negative impact from specific geos and prior-year XP comparables.
The transition of our customers to cloud and subscription annuity services is a critical element of our business transformation. To provide ongoing transparency into our progress we’ve added a new KPI commercial annuity mix. This quarter 82% of our commercial revenue came from annuity revenue streams which is up 5 points from last year. While quarter-to-quarter the mix can vary with uneven growth rates we’ve seen in transactional licensing before and after the XP refresh cycle. The overall trend clearly reflects the meaningful progress that we have made.
Office commercial products and services declined 2% but grew 1% in constant currency. Japan was a three-point drag. We successfully renewed a large volume of annuity contract expirations in Q3 at healthy levels in line with historical rate. And we continue to see a strong shift from traditional licensing to Office 365 across our business customers. In each of the last three quarters we have added more Office 365 seats than transactional licenses with SMB customers.
Server products and services continued to exhibit strong momentum with revenue growth of 12% and 16% in constant currency. Our portfolio is well-positioned to meet the needs of our customers for their private, public and hybrid cloud solutions. Adoption of our premium products remains strong and revenue grew 25% across our premium offerings for SQL, System Center and Windows Server.
Overall, revenue from our commercial cloud services more than doubled again this quarter. Enterprise penetration is accelerating with over half of all agreements signed during the quarter including cloud services. Within Office 365 premium workload now make up more than 50% of the install base and we are seeing strong attach of our enterprise mobility solutions to Office 365. As our usage grew rapidly this quarter and Dynamics CRM online benefited from strong customer growth.
Moving now to operating expenses which were favorable to our guidance driven by decisions that we made during the quarter to reduce spending and to continue to reallocate resources to accelerate growth in key areas. For instance, in markets where we are facing challenges, we reduced our sales and marketing expense to reflect the current environment and as I mentioned earlier in my comments on our phone business, we took further actions to lower our cost base. Across the company we continue to prioritize and reallocate our spend to activities with the highest impact.
The result was that operating expenses grew 4% for the company. Normalizing for the approximately $300 million year-over-year benefit from FX and the addition of $570 million related to phone, operating expenses grew just 1%.
Our effective tax rate was 24%, which is 5 points higher than last year. The increase is primarily driven by the inclusion of our phone results and our changing geographic mix.
We returned $7.5 billion to shareholders this quarter which is an increase of $3 billion from Q2. This change is consistent with our objective to increase capital return to shareholders with the focus on value.
With that overview the current quarter, let me now turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter. I’ll start with a few overall comments for additional context. The guidance that we are providing is based on current FX rates and should actual rates differ they will be reflected in our financial results. As a reminder, in our annuity businesses the FX impact is first reflected in our unearned revenue as is it is based on rates when the contract is billed and then into the P&L at that same rate as the revenue is recognized generally over the next year.
In Q4 unearned revenue will reflect three quarters of billings with the stronger U.S. dollar which will negatively impact year-over-year comparables. Likewise, we’ll be recognizing a higher percentage of revenue from periods with the stronger U.S. dollar in both the recently completed Q3 and also the prior-year comparisons. In total, we expect FX will impact revenue growth by approximately four points in Q4 with the majority of that impact in our Commercial segment. While XP-related comparables remain tough for Q4, we are starting to anniversary the XP benefits from last year.
And finally, from a geographic perspective, we expect the year-over-year declines in Japan to continue. With that additional context, I’ll now move to more specific guidance, starting with Devices and Consumer.
In licensing, in Q4 last year, we recognized $382 million of revenue related to the end of the commercial agreement with Nokia, which will impact year-over-year growth trends. For this Q4, we expect revenue to be $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion. This range reflects the anniversary of XP, the impact of the Japanese economy and an anticipated draw-down of inventories in the PC ecosystem ahead of the release of Windows 10 this summer. Within consumer Office, we expect similar trends to Q3, including the continued transition to Office 365 subscriptions.
In Computing and Gaming Hardware, with the addition of Surface 3, we expect revenue to be $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion. In Phone Hardware, we expect revenue to be $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, with continued momentum in value smartphones and anticipated declines in non-Lumia phones. Gross margins will reflect similar dynamics to Q3. In Devices and Consumer Other, we expect revenue to be $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion with continued growth in Bing, Office 365 and Xbox Live transactions. In Commercial Licensing, we expect revenue of $10.5 billion to $10.6 billion with a continuing shift to annuity. This range reflects roughly four points of negative impact from FX in addition to the factors I discussed earlier. In Commercial Other, we expect momentum to continue in our commercial cloud with revenue $3.0 billion to $3.1 billion. And in Corporate, we don’t expect any revenue impact.
We expect COGS to be $7.2 billion to $7.4 billion with variability being driven by both hardware segments. We expect operating expenses to be $8.4 billion to $8.5 billion. This range implies that our full-year operating expenses will be roughly $2 billion below our initial guidance for the year while still investing in key growth opportunities across R&D and sales.
We have benefited from FX, but the biggest driver has been our ongoing cost discipline and prioritization efforts. In Q4, we expect to incur $100 million integration expenses and, separately, another $100 million in restructuring expenses. As a reminder, other income and expense includes dividend and interest income offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging. Given the current FX environment, we expect our net cost of hedging to increase and other income and expense to be negative $200 million. We expect our Q4 tax rate to be 22% to 24%.
In Q4, we expect CapEx to sequentially increase in support of our growing Cloud business. And we expect unearned revenue will grow sequentially, in line with historical seasonality, excluding the foreign currency impact.
In closing, as you heard from Satya, we are making progress in our strategic goals and we are seeing are focused investments land in differentiated products, customer usage and sales results. Customers are seeing and embracing our innovation, leading to increased usage of our cloud services and a transition towards subscription and multiyear purchasing. We continued to invest aggressively to capture opportunities where we see competitive advantage while also becoming more efficient to accelerate our pace of innovation.
We encourage you next week to watch the webcast of keynotes from our Build developer conference. We will share more of the innovation happening with Windows 10 and our cloud services. We’ll also host our financial analyst briefing, where Satya, Kevin Turner and I will discuss how the company’s transformation provides unique growth opportunities that drive increased lifetime customer value across our core businesses. We look forward to sharing that progress with you.
And with that, let me turn it back over to Chris for Q&A.
Chris Suh
Thanks, Amy. We’ll now move to Q&A. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. We’ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please proceed.
Brent Thill
Good afternoon. You had great momentum in the cloud. I was curious if you could just talk about the positioning in both in on trend and cloud environments? And also weave in what you’re seeing with Azure.
Satya Nadella
Sure, Brent. Thanks for the question. Overall when I think about the Microsoft cloud it’s really the combination of Office 365 dynamics as well as Azure. We think about our capital allocation that way, we think about our utilization product architecture and customer value and how uniquely we can bring these three assets together to serve our customers well. And that’s the momentum you see and I talked about the run rate, the usage metrics and there’s really increasing intensity of usage amongst organizational customers in our commercial cloud. One of the other things also is a huge benefit for us is, because our cloud, our public cloud runs on our software assets, our software asset gets packaged up as our servers.
In fact, I think of our servers as the edge of our cloud. So the unique capability we now have in Windows Server, SQL Server is becoming that much more competitive. Because we’re running our public cloud in it and that’s what anyone deploying their own private cloud expects to have. And so you see there’s two sides of benefits and two sides for us. One is in our cloud momentum, which itself is the combination of SAS applications, paths , and IADs which I believe is unique in the marketplace as well as with the software itself is packaged up into our private cloud offering be it Windows Server or SQL Server and they’re becoming increasingly competitive in the enterprise and data center additions. And so that’s what you’ve seen in our commercial results, both on the licensing side as well as on the cloud side.
Chris Suh
Thanks, Brett. We’ll move to the next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse.
Philip Winslow
Hi. Thanks. Congratulations on a great quarter. I just wanted to focus in on Office 365 because some of those metrics really jumped out to us. It seems like overall revenue between commercial and E&D for Office 365 is up over 100%. If you look at the consumer user count is up pretty huge this quarter-to-quarter there. The question is sort of about Satya and Amy. Satya when you think about the positioning and sort of where we are in just the adoption lifecycle of Office 365 on the consumer side and then the SMB and enterprise. Where are we in terms of the inflection point there? And then Amy, how should we think about going forward in terms of the guidance that you gave how we should think about the financial implications of where we are in that transition from off-premise to the Office 365?
Satya Nadella
Let me start, and Amy you could take it from there. Overall I would say there’s a secular movement that’s happening in particular with Office 365, quite frankly, it’s happening across the entire product portfolio of Microsoft which is more to what I would described as annuity relationship as well as subscription relationships. Because those of a long-term contracts relationships we want to have with our customers be it consumer, be it small business or large customers. In all the years I’ve been at Microsoft it was always our dream to be able to sell more of the sophisticated capabilities of Office to individual consumers as well as small businesses.
But it was hard to do in the previous generation because of the server infrastructure and what I would say sophistication of IT required. Whereas now with the cloud for the first time we now can serve both individuals as well as small businesses with the same kind of sophistication that in the past was exclusively available for the large enterprises. That’s what you see when we see our subscription growth in consumer, we see subscription growth in small business these are folks who never bought a server from us. So that’s what we’re seeing is increasing, what I would call, annuity relationships and subscription relationships with all classes of customers.
And it’s new penetration, so it’s not even a one-for-one replacement, even for the enterprise customer there consumption is going up. They may have consumed one or two workloads but now they can have the opportunity to consume the entirety of the portfolio and not just that. If you look at the products in Office 365 that we have, take eDiscovery it’s a complete new space for us where we are able to do things in security eDiscovery enterprise management that we didn’t even do for the top end of the enterprise in the service side, so that’s what we’re seeing.
Amy Hood
And, Phil, on the math that sits behind that, it’s a good timing. Next week at the financial analyst briefing, I’ll send the – and have a lot more time to explain the actual lifetime value of each of these customer segments, especially in Office 365. But I think in consumer, it’s maybe the easiest one to talk about, is that we talked about license growth of 10%, when you correct for Japan. Our ability to quickly, I think, move our customer base through stronger execution, both direct through retail and having our channel execute well and partner with us on this transition. I do think we’ve made a lot of progress. And maybe more importantly, we continue to innovate in the product and deliver value to the end user, which is really what matters. And so I think we’ll be able to show the progress we’ve made over every quarter, and give you some goals going forward. So I look forward to having the chance to spend more time on that in detail.
And SMB looks very similar in some ways. They purchased similarly, was bought with a PC, was bought one time, it was infrequent, with an inability, as Satya said, to add workloads. So I think those are some of the bigger transitions you’ve seen for us in terms of being able to increase the value. So hopefully, we’ll be able to give you more details on that next week.
Philip Winslow
I’ve been waiting for those details for years. I appreciate that. All right. Thanks, guys.
Chris Suh
Thanks, Phil. Next question, please, operator.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Keith Weiss
Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question, and a very nice quarter. I think one of the highlights of the past year has definitely been the expense control, and I guess you could call it, like a normalized OpEx growth of just 1% in the quarter, continues to be very impressive. How should investors, and how should we think about the sustainability of that expense control. Or how long can you keep sort of investing for these growth initiatives, like cloud, yet keep your overall OpEx growth rate so low on a go forward basis?
Satya Nadella
Let me start, and then I’ll have Amy add. Overall, the core of how I want us to approach expenses is to make sure that we are not limited in our ability to invest in categories where we have unique things to, contribute. So we’re going to do that though, with great discipline, and that’s what I think you’ve seen us do over the course of the last year, and we’ll continue to exhibit that. But at the same time, we will not shrink away from our ability to go put investment, be it in sales, marketing or product R&D, when we clearly have unique things in secular categories of growth. And that’s something that we have the capability of doing, and we want to be able to do that in a disciplined way.
Amy Hood
And I would just add, I generally think about two key items that we’ve been able to think about, across the leadership team. First is, I think we have exhibited an increasing ability, over the course of the year, to reallocate during the year, both at the organization level and at the team level, to make sure our dollars are going to the highest ROI things. And secondly, I think it’s a general belief held at the highest levels of the company, that operating efficiency increases our ability to be responsive, both to the needs of our customers, as well as innovate faster inside this place. And I think when you take those two things, along with what Satya said, being able to balance disciplined focus and execution for us, I think we feel very good about the progress we’ve made.
Keith Weiss
Yes. Thank you.
Chris Suh
Thanks, Keith. Next question, please, operator.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Rick Sherlund with Nomura. Please proceed.
Rick Sherlund
Thank you. Satya, you mentioned, a year ago, that we’re going to see a next generation of personal productivity software. I wonder if you could update us on what that means. And when we might see that as just an extension of Office 365? Or how do we monetize those products? And when will we hear more about them? And Amy, we didn’t see any tech guarantees in the quarter for the upcoming Windows 10 launch, and we also haven’t heard anything more about changes in accounting for Windows 10, given that there’s going to be a big undelivered element there. Is that something we should expect to hear more about next week?
Satya Nadella
Sure. Let me start. Thanks, Rick. What I think about even just my own day-to-day usage of Office, even in the last year, it’s gone through a drastic amount of change. Of course, I use Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Outlook, on a daily basis. But if I think about all the tools that I’m using, which is all part of Office 365, today, on a daily basis and multiple times a day I start my day as I talked about in many conferences with Dell which is a tool I love which is in fact something that’s uniquely possible because of the shift to Office 365 where we can take organizational data and breakthrough all the boundaries or, again, in silos inside an organization and have people discover information. It’s the richest way for me to visualize what’s happening at Microsoft in real time. That news feed for me is kind of the lifeblood of Microsoft. I use Power BI . One of the things that we talked a lot about is usage.
In fact, one of the cultural changes inside the company is everyone from the frontline engineer to the frontline salesperson is responsible for usage. And given that, we want to have these leading indicators showing up in our dashboard not are static reports and Power BI is this rich canvas for us to be able to, one, visualize data as well as ask natural language questions. I look at my own usage of one note in Surface. That’s gone through a fee change both because of the hardware innovation, innovation in Windows, innovation in Office. I look at something like Sway which I’m pretty excited about because basically we’re taking the concept of what is an interactive document and the website and bringing it all together into these Sway documents if you well and if you’re excited about what that could mean in customer service marketing or for school reports.
So that’s – we are well into it so that is not going to be waiting for some future date to release anything that’s new, but we’re well on our way with all of these tools and they’re available today and we’ll of course be iterating continuously.
Amy Hood
And, Rick, on your other two questions specific to the tech guarantee that you would think about the time of year, due to the specific nature of the offer we have on Windows 10, there won’t be a tech guarantee as you think about it for this upgrade cycle and there’s disclosure in fact, in our revenue recognition section in the 10-Q that talks about that specifically. When we talk about the accounting for Windows 10, I will touch on that next week but as we get closer to the launch we’ll go into more specifics.
And I’m so excited about the space. I don’t want to miss this one other big scenario which is Cortana , that’s perhaps the thing that’s going to change personal productivity even most and especially with Windows 10 and how Cortana comes to Windows, both to the browser as well as to the start, I think it completely change what personal productivity software mean from a day-to-day experience as well.
Chris Suh
Thanks, Rick. Next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein. Please proceed.
Mark Moerdler
Satya, Amy, congrats on the quarter. Thank you for taking my question. So if Windows OEM Pro has now stabilized excluding the bump that we saw from XP Refresh and volume licensing at least in constant currency is stable growing, should we figure that we’ve now started to turn the quarter on commercial Windows revenue? In addition, where do you think we are on the consumer side on the non-OEM front? Is that something that continue to shrink for a bit?
Amy Hood
Let me take that one. Satya, you can add at the end of you want. No. I think, Mark, you’re reading it correctly. We actually had our annuity volume licensing business as you know, has been showing growth and stability for a while as we talked about Pro is back to the pre-XP levels and while could see some fluctuation, I think this has been a very stable business for us for a long period of time when you take out that XP bump from last year. Talking about consumer, I think frankly Satya and I both reflected a bit on it in our comments. We do expect to see some additional inventory draw down in front of a launch. That’s not unusual prior to a launch cycle and that will clearly impact our revenue in the quarter.
But I think as I look to 2016, I’m excited about the designs we’ve seen, I’m excited about the products that are possible with Windows 10, and I think we feel good and are looking forward to sharing some of that excitement next week.
Satya Nadella
Yeah, the one thing I’d also add is there is actually a much more fundamental transformation happening even with how we think about Windows and its delivery and we’ll talk more about this even at our financial analyst briefing next week because I increasingly think about the lifetime value we can deliver to the user of a Windows device be it in consumer or even in the enterprise. And if you think about when we say Windows-as-a-service it’s actually a pretty profound construct which involves us being able to not only think about what ships with OEMs, but how do we on a continuous basis, if it’s a consumer we have things now in the store, we have subscriptions, we have gaming and then when it comes to the enterprise there’s management, security, servicing which is all unique value. So there is going to be an increasing emphasis in the concept of lifetime value that we can deliver to customers.
Mark Moerdler
Perfect. I really do appreciate it.
Satya Nadella
Thanks, Mark.
Mark Moerdler
Thank you.
Chris Suh
Thank you, Mark. Next question, please.

Our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies. Please proceed.
John DiFucci
Thanks. Listen, it sounds like Cloud and Azure represents an opportunity to transition existing customers to a Cloud model, but also to expand your customer base or penetrate – or penetration into your current customer base with – I mean incremental business is what I’m talking about. I would think that most of Office 365, because most people were already on Office, represents transition from life to license model, but so far, and I know it’s still early, but so far what about the rest? Can you give us an idea of how much of this is new business and how much of this is transition business?
Satya Nadella
Let me start and then you can add. I mean I think you have to sort of look at all the use cases. In fact as I said, a lot of the Azure use case, I think you referenced this, have been non-zero-sum because our people started building their mobile back end, web back end using Big Data not workloads we have. I look at sort of everyday usage growth, even if they’re creating a web workload it’s for a very different type of web back end and a mobile back end. And the same thing with advanced analytics. I even look at the growth of virtual machine instances on Azure. We not only see Windows Server obviously but we see 20%-plus of Linux growth. So that’s again non-zero-sum .
So there’s significant traction we have in terms of moving beyond just one-for-one shift of a workload that traditionally ran on our server to our Azure Cloud. In fact if anything the majority of what we are seeing is new. Even in Office 365 it’s not just one-for-one shift. Of course if you are – were using as a large enterprise Exchange and you moved to Office 365 you moved to using Exchange Online; same thing is true for SharePoint. But again take all the other things I described, power BI , Dell and the list goes on, take eDiscovery; even for the largest of enterprise these were things that had low penetration or low deployment. And so we are seeing increasing usage of that.
Same thing with our Dynamics business. EMS , it’s completely a new category. We never had that kind of a management footprint. We now have the ability to have one control plane for IT for all the devices, identity management, device management, data protection. That’s a new workload. So that’s what we’re seeing. We definitely are seeing one-for-one migration, but the opportunity in everyone one of our offerings from Office 365 to Dynamics to Azure has a non-zero-sum component to it.
John DiFucci
Thanks, Satya. Just want to be clear because you said something, I mean other than Office 365 did you say the majority of the Cloud business is new business? Or – and again, I know it can’t be – I mean maybe you know exactly what it is but I’m sure some of it is somewhat cloudy or – no pun intended, or vague, but do you think most of it at this point is new business? Is that what I heard you say?
Satya Nadella
Yeah, and also it sort of comes in interesting ways because one of the things IT, as you know, it’s not about sort of replacing what you have, it’s always augmenting what you have. A very classic scenario would be I’ll take a SQL database application, bring it to the Cloud and then build a new mobile back end using the same data. So reuse of code, reuse of data, so you would use some amount if iOS infrastructure and then past consumption. So that’s one of the very typical enterprise solutions you will see. In fact, our own IT Systems, take what we have done with our HR and our financial systems and some of those things as they move to the Cloud, we bring some existing and then add to it.
Amy Hood
And, John, to your specific question, you’re right. A lot of the Azure is, the good way to think about that is new; and especially our Dynamics business, CRM online and some of the work we’ve done across AX is certainly all new. And the lower down in the segment of Office you get, the more new it is, is the way to think about it.
John DiFucci
Great. Thank you very much.
Chris Suh
Thanks. Next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed.
Walter Pritchard
Hi. Just a follow up to the question John had on Azure. Amazon released their profitability for the first time on AWS and it was I think higher than most people were expecting. I’m wondering how we should think about your mix of business in Azure? You’re running Linux, you’re running a lot of services based on open source software, you’re also running some of your own IP there. How should we think about where your margins are today and should we think of Amazon’s AWS margins as a good benchmark for where you could be at like sort of scale they’re at today?
Satya Nadella
First of all, I don’t think that of the comparison between Azure and AWS is the true north for me. I think about the Microsoft Cloud because even the way we do capital, the way we measure utilization is all with the complete unit, which is of course all of Office 365 runs on Azure, Azure AD powers all of our Cloud, so it’s really its entirety that we think of as our unique value. So that means we have SaaS which is a huge component between O 365 and Dynamics, PaaS which is a huge component of Azure itself. We see many customers who would use even our PaaS services and even AWS. So we – for example, you can in fact do a single sign-on using EMS and Azure AD in Azure and use – so your resources on AWS.
And then of course we have our iOS business. So that’s how we think about it. And then it’s reflected even in our margins. So when we look at our Cloud margins, they will have our revenue quality, which is very different; that’s a combination of past iOS and SaaS. And that’s how we want to make sure we make progress, because that’s where both product value which is unique to us and also the quality of revenue that’s unique to us.
But the one other thing that I – see my world view is not that all compute storage networks just goes to one place. That’s why I think of our servers as the edge of our Cloud, and as I said there’s a huge software asset in there which is becoming increasingly competitive. Of course we don’t count that in our run rates or when we talk about our $6 billion plus run rate, that’s just pure public Cloud number and that’s fantastic to see and we want to measure it that way. But quite frankly if you sort of looked at what’s broadly happening in the Cloud transition, we are participating in both the private hybrid Cloud as well as the public Cloud.
Chris Suh
Thanks, Walter.
Walter Pritchard
Amy on OpEx, you have – I guess not necessarily you but the company generally at this time has given some color into the next fiscal year’s OpEx. Is that something we should expect at the Build event with your Analyst Meeting next week? Or any – I’m sure you’re not going to give it to us today but – or right here, but just wanted to figure out expectations around when we should hear about that?
Amy Hood
We’ll continue to talk generally about it. I don’t expect to give specific guidance on FY 2016 next week.
Walter Pritchard
Okay.
Amy Hood
Okay, Walter.
Walter Pritchard
Thank you very much.
Chris Suh
Thanks. We’ll go to the next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Heather Bellini
Great. I had two questions. One was related to the success of the sub 250 machines that you guys in the market have been seeing and just what geos have seen the best uptake for those so far? And then just, if there is a little bit more color you can share about the drivers of the commercial licensing business and I’ve recognized all the affiliate that you guys just gave guidance for Q4. But as kind of as we look out over the next year or two, what are the big puts and takes in particular maybe on the server and tool side that we need to think about?
Satya Nadella
I’ll start. I think as far as the low-cost devices, it’s pretty broad. I think we think of the U.S. itself being in fact a big driver of some of the growth on the consumer side. We’re also obviously – stimulated this so that we can be much more effective even in the educational markets worldwide. And Amy can add to that if we had any more detail on it.
When it comes to our Commercial Licensing and our servers, it’s the same trend, Heather, which is the big shift that’s happening is our enterprise and datacenter products, being Windows Server, Systems Centers , SQL Server, are more competitive. It’s the same thing that I would say at least in the last couple of years clearly have played out. There is clearly – and in fact, as our products have become competitive there’s been this mix shift. People have bought from us previously just standard editions are able to now look at our enterprise editions and that’s what’s playing out.
And there’s definitely some pricing action we were able to take, but mostly because we were able to deliver this incremental value. And even with all the pricing action we took, we, from a total cost of ownership or just raw pricing perspective are very competitive versus what’s available in the market. So that’s what we see. And so the cycle some of the pricing actions obviously were anniversary out, but the overall thing that I’m focused on is how can we continue to run our software asset ourselves in public cloud and translate that into our servers. And really paint this vision and make it a reality of hybrid computing and drive the secular growth of that.
Amy Hood
Thanks, Heather.
Chris Suh
We’ll have time for one more question, please.
Operator
Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Mark Murphy
Yeah, Satya, I’m wondering what inning do you think we are in terms of building out the next generation data centers but you’ll need to support the commercial cloud. For example, do you think you’ve built out data center capacity to support the commercial cloud business all the way to a $10 billion dollars run rate or $20 billion run rates? So if there’s any way you can help us to try to gauge how much overhead you have in the capacity. And perhaps what type of data center footprint you envision a few years down the road.
Satya Nadella
In fact, one of the big changes that has happened I would say in the last couple of years, and I’ll have Amy even detail out. It’s the way we’re going about everything from the very long lead things like actual data center locations and Build out to the procurement of individual machines, and essentially the work in progress inventory of that. We have driven significant process improvement to essentially make it as efficient as one can make it and that’s a continuous process for us.
So when I think about even the capital allocation per quarter we very carefully look at what is our current utilization forecast, and what our demand forecast is. And we now have the ability to be much more dynamic. Surely there are some things which are long lead like data center location. But you don’t need to build out data centers much before they’re really being utilized. And so we have a very good process and that’s a place were quite frankly a lot of the proprietary advantage of someone who is an at scale public cloud provider, not just with one application. And this is where the huge distinction is. After all we did run large-scale consumer services ourselves between Xbox LIVE and Bing. But this business of supporting a highly geo distributed enterprise cloud business is very different than just running in one at scale public cloud service. And we learned a lot with what is our workload diversity as well as our geo-diversity. And our supply chain management is optimized for it.
Amy Hood
Yeah, I would just add Mark. This is a place as Satya said we have made a lot of progress in being data-driven. This is down to a monthly review by workload, by property, by geo. And this is a place where I feel that we are in it terrific position frankly to respond to data sovereignty demands, changes politically and our ability to execute that to provide what our customers demand in terms of security and manageability and location. It’s something that we also care a lot about.
Mark Murphy
Thank you.
Chris Suh
Thanks. Mark.

And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Satya.
Satya Nadella
Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon everyone.
Today I'll focus my topline thoughts on our progress this quarter and the progress we're making in transforming our business. This quarter we reached $26.5 billion in revenue, with an operating income of $7.8 billion. This quarter's results show the product and business transformation underway at Microsoft.
We saw success in a number of our strategic areas including cloud adoption, redefining and revitalizing the Windows Ecosystem and improving economics in our hardware portfolio.
We also saw some challenges this quarter. As expected, the one-time benefit of Windows XP end-of-life PC refresh cycle has now tailed off. Additionally, we ran into unexpected issues in select geographies. Where there are execution issues, we will address them. Where there are macroeconomic challenges, we will weather them. With that in mind, I'll walk you through the quarter.
Let's start with our Cloud business, an area where we're extending our leadership position and accelerating our innovation. In commercial cloud, we saw continued customer and revenue growth across a growing footprint of cloud services, Office 365, Azure, Enterprise Mobility Suite and Dynamic CRM Online.
In fact this quarter is the sixth consecutive quarter of triple digit revenue growth in commercial cloud and we're now at a run rate of $5.5 billion. Azure services continue to grow in appeal to enterprise IT and developers with rapid improvements across hybrid services, premium cloud storage and virtual machine offerings, enhanced data and data analytics offerings.
Microsoft Enterprise Mobility Suite is one key area of product innovation that I would like to highlight given the growth and the uniqueness of this offering. Microsoft offers a comprehensive solution for all devices that brings together mobile device management, mobile application management, hybrid identity management and data protection into one unified offering through EMS.
Office 365 now includes new application experiences on all phones and tablets for mobile productivity. Further we've released completely new scenarios. This includes Office Sway for visualizing and sharing ideas, Delve to help search and discover content, Office 365 Groups to make it easier to collaborate, Office 365 Video for secure media streaming for businesses.
Finally we continue to invest in enterprise value by integrating MDM and Enterprise Mobility Suite into Office 365. New encryption technologies, compliance certification and new e-discovery capabilities in exchange.
In Dynamic CRM Online, we added 53 markets this quarter, bringing us to 130 markets around the world. We're bringing together CRM with Cortana, Yammer, Power BI and Skype to add unique value to customers.
We're expanding our capabilities in the Cloud through five new acquisitions. Last week we announced an agreement to purchase revolution analytics, the leading provider of statistical computing and predictive analytics, which will enable our customers to unlock big data in size.
We bought HockeyApp, a leading mobile app testing and development service to enhance Azure services for mobile developers. Our acquisition of [Orato] [ph] accelerates our ability to give customers unique security capabilities by tapping into behavioral intelligence on identity and access spanning on-premise and the cloud.
We're bringing on new capabilities in machine learning as applied to e-Discovery and other enterprise compliance processes with the acquisition of Equivio and we also welcomed Acompli, a provider of innovative mobile email applications for IOS and Android.
The common theme across all these acquisitions is advanced data analytics and machine learning driven capabilities that improve with more customer adoption and usage of the cloud.
We're also making progress in our consumer cloud services. Office 365 home and personal revenue grew nearly 150% year-over-year as we added 2.1 million net new subscribers since last quarter.
Bing U.S. search share continues to grow, as does search revenue with 23% growth this quarter. I will talk about our progress in Xbox live later in my comments. Now let's turn to Windows.
To start, the overall Windows Ecosystem is driving more innovation. Over the holiday season at SCES, our partner showcased a diverse lineup of Windows devices, including more premium device choices than ever.
Last spring we made a strategic decision to introduce new Windows pricing programs to drive unit growth in opening price point PCs as well as tablets and this quarter year-over-year growth.
Also businesses continue to value Windows. We're seeing healthy demand for Windows Pro even though we faced challenging prior year comparables in Q2 as well as in the second half of the year, following the Windows XP end of support related PC refresh.
Now let's talk about Windows 10. Last week was an important milestone on our path to release Windows 10 and ushering an era of more personal computing. The heritage of Windows was about enabling one single device, the PC.
With Windows 10, we're building a device platform for the mobile-first, cloud-first world. It's a world where the mobility of a person's experience is paramount, requiring a platform that spans devices from small screens to large screens, to no screens at all. It's a world where interacting with technologies as natural as interacting with other people and it's a world that demands trust and security.
It is also a world with rich opportunity for developers and Windows 10 will be the most attractive windows development platform ever, with our free upgrade offer and with universal application and unified store for developers, we'll have a large unified up to date user base to target.
We want people to love Windows and have made this our most collaborative project yet with more than two million insiders giving us feedback every day. I am very optimistic about Windows 10.
We're making progress with our own devices, for those in the market today and also the ones that we've recently announced. This quarter we surpassed the $1 billion revenue mark with surface for the first time. The value proposition of being the most productive tablet is resonating.
Further the sales for Lumia phones top 10 million units growing 30% year-over-year this quarter with strength in devices such as Lumia 500 and 600 series, our affordable smartphone. In this segment of the market, the combination of our brand and value standout and we plan to continue to build a beachhead here.
We're also creating new device types that open up new markets and opportunities for Microsoft. In October we launched our first wearable, the Microsoft band and just last week we revealed two new hardware with Windows 10 with Microsoft Surface Hub and Microsoft HoloLens.
Microsoft Surface Hub will revolutionize group collaboration and meetings, HoloLens and Windows holographic computing will make mix reality applications part of everyday life across work and home.
I want to talk briefly about Xbox. Xbox One console adoption accelerated this holiday and was the top-selling console in the U.S. and fans on Xbox Live were engaged with the service more than ever before. However, it's our strategies coming together with Windows 10 that give me the greatest optimism.
The vibrant social gaming community on Xbox Live will span Xbox, Windows PC, Tablets and phones. With Windows 10 gamers on a PC, tablet or Xbox console can play together and games on Xbox One can easily stream through a Window 10 PC or tablet.
It's also getting clear how games people love today will evolve to mind-blowing experiences in the future when designed for mixed reality that Windows 10 and HoloLens create. Just imagine what's possible with Minecraft. Gaming truly is a valuable part of millions of people's lives and Microsoft will excel and increase our lead.
Before closing, I wanted to share a few thoughts on capital allocation. Over the past several quarters and certainly with last week's Windows 10 announcements you've seen us unleash new innovation in our cloud services with Windows and our hardware. We did all of this without materially growing our cost base.
This required clarity and purpose and value proposition, realignment of talent and disciplined execution. Our increasing innovation and competitiveness in today's growth markets and the creation of new categories is how we will most positively impact the returns for our investors.
Earlier today, we announced our intention to complete the existing $40 billion share repurchase authorization by December 31, 2016. This is another step in our ongoing commitment to increase capital return for our shareholders while investing in the growth of our business.
It too shows our optimism for the future growth of Microsoft. As we move forward we will certainly continue to be thoughtful in our capital return decisions balanced across dividends and share repurchases.
In closing, I am encouraged by the progress we are making in our transformation to become the productivity and platform company with a mobile mobile-first, cloud-first world. I'm proud of how our teams are stepping up to both change and execute to make this transformation happen.
I'm confident of the decisions and choices we're making to drive our business and products forward to serve our customers and partners in the future.
With that, I'll hand over to Amy to go through the quarter's results in further detail and share our outlook for the next quarter. I look forward to rejoining you after that to answer your questions. Thank you.
Amy Hood
Thanks, and good afternoon, everyone.
As Satya shared in Q2 we again made solid progress on our business transformation. We had strong growth in our cloud and subscription businesses, our annuity renewals were healthy as customers remained committed to our enterprise portfolio and our hardware products performed well during the holiday season.
As we expected our year-over-year growth rates were impacted by the prior year benefits that we realized in our OEMs and office transactional businesses following the Windows XP end of support refresh cycle.
Beyond that, our results in China and Japan fell short of our expectations. In Japan, the PC market lagged due to the macroeconomic environment along with the combined impact of XP end of support and the VAT increase last year.
Our Office attach rate to PCs is very high there, so the weak PC market also impacted Office revenue. With that said, let me take you through the financial highlights of our second quarter.
Revenue was $26.5 billion up 8% and would have been one point better without the impact of foreign exchange. Gross margin grew slightly this quarter even when comparing against a year ago that benefited from the XP Refresh cycle.
Our commitment to ongoing execution improvement and thoughtful folio management helped improve the gross margin percentage in each of our operating segments.
Operating income declined 2% which included $243 million of integration and restructuring expenses. Excluding that, operating income grew 1%. Our reported GAAP earnings per share was $0.71, which included $0.02 negative impact from integration and restructuring expense and $0.04 income tax charge for an IRS audit adjustment. Foreign exchange had $0.01 negative impact on EPS.
As we discussed last quarter, FX movement first impact of bookings growth and unearned revenue on our balance sheet are contracted but not billed balance was adjusted down to reflect current FX rates. Therefore our bookings were flat this quarter.
Unearned revenue was up 9% year-over-year to $21.2 billion, but the sequential decline was slightly larger -- slightly higher than we expected due to the larger than anticipated impact from FX. Adjusting for that FX impact our commercial unearned balance is in line with historical trends and our expectations.
From a geographic perspective relative to our expectations the U.S. outperformed in Europe was generally in line. As I mentioned earlier, China and Japan were below our expectations.
With that backdrop I will now move to a detailed discussion of our results. Last year we ended support for Windows XP. That simulated a PC Refresh cycle in particular in developed market and with business customers.
During the period from Q2 through the end of our fiscal year Windows Pro revenue growth was over 10% and meaningfully outpaced business PC growth.
As expected in Q2 PCs have reverted to a more normal live mix between developed and emerging markets and Pro attached Business PCs has returned to the levels we saw prior to FY '14.
Also to drive revenue growth in academic institutions we lowered the price of Windows Pro for that customer segment. This pricing change along with the impact of XP caused Windows revenue growth to be lower than the relatively stable business PC market we have seen the end of FY '13.
We again grew Window non-Pro licenses and saw year-over-year growth in activations. This was driven by particularly strong demand for opening price point PCs related to the strategic decisions Satya just spoke of earlier.
The harbor mix shift opening price point PCs impacted license mix and therefore aggregate revenue per license in the quarter. The mixed shift was the main driver of our Windows non-Pro revenue decline.
Inventory in the channel is a bit higher than normal which we expect to work through in Q3. Office consumer products and services revenue declined 12% and was impacted by the ongoing transition to Office 365 and by the dynamics in Japan where PC growth was lower than we expected in a geography where the paid attractive Office is high. Adoption of Office 365 home and personal remained strong and we now have over 9.2 million subscribers.
In our computing and gaming segment we are proud of the continued progress we are making in our service portfolio. Strong interest in Surface Pro 3 helped to drive record revenue as well as improved gross margins. Surface Pro 3 volumes are pacing over three times the rate of what we saw for Surface Pro 2.
In gaming, Xbox One was the console sales leader in the U.S. Xbox live users grew and those users increased their purchases of third party publisher content and consumables. Sales of the Xbox platform exclusive Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Forza Horizon 2 were strong and this quarter we welcome Minecraft.
We articulated our plan for the phone business back in July and we are executing to plan. With our Lumia portfolio of phones we are driving volumes in the low priced device category. We sold 10.5 million Lumia phones this quarter an all-time high.
We also sold over 39 million non-Lumia phones even while we make changes to the product portfolio and manage this business for profitability. We are looking forward to bringing new products to market that will showcase the features that we presented at our Windows 10 event last week.
Revenue in our devices and consumer other segment grew 30%. As noted earlier, Xbox Live transactions and first party game performed well and contributed to this growth. Additionally, search revenue growth was strong with improvements in both rate and volumes.
Within display, revenue declined our MSN portal though we saw revenue growth across other Microsoft properties. We are also pleased by our gross margin expansion in this segment.
Transitioning now to our consumer results where revenue grew 5%. Our annuity revenue remained strong growing double-digits and renewal rates remained high. Customers are continuing to move from transactional purchasing to long-term annuity contracts as they showed increased commitment to our product roadmap.
Our transactional revenue declined over 15%, slightly more than we expected primarily in Office and mostly due to our performance in China and Japan, which I detailed earlier. Additionally, FX had a greater negative impact on commercial revenue than we had anticipated.
Our commercial cloud services delivered triple digit revenue growth for the sixth consecutive quarter. Office 365 continues to be priority for CIOs as both existing and new customers move to the cloud. This transition accelerated with 45% of our renewal season Office moving to the cloud this quarter.
We are seeing great growth in revenue from premium Azure services driven by both increasing customer base and an expansion in the number of services that those customers deploy. Within Dynamic CRM Online, customer growth accelerated and revenue nearly doubled.
From a product perspective, commercial Office product and services revenue declined 1%, slightly below our expectations. Annuity revenue remained strong with high renewal rates and continued adoption of Office 365.
Within our Office transactional business year-on-year comparables are difficult given the benefits from last year's XP Refresh where customers chose to update their desktop productivity solutions along with their PC.
Additionally the shift to Office 365 continues to impact transactional revenue. While these dynamics were consistent with our expectations, revenue in China and Japan both fell short given the factors that I noted earlier.
Server products and services revenue grew 9%, again outpacing the broader IT markets. Growth in premium mix helped to drive double-digit revenue growth in SQL Server and system center. Windows Server annuity revenue grew double-digits again this quarter.
Our transactional revenue was down primarily due to a declining traditional server market. Additionally, we are pleased with the performance in our Dynamics business which grew revenues 13% driven by growth in both on premises and cloud offerings.
Operating expense grew 1% to $8.3 billion and was favorable to our expectation. These results are inclusive of investments that we made in our strategic growth areas, a few of which were showcased last week at our Windows 10 event. Excluding approximately $750 million from the addition of NDS operating expense would have declined 8%.
Relative to the guidance that we provided for the quarter, roughly half of the favorability resulted from FX changes with the balance driven by our continued prioritization of spend.
Our integration and restructuring efforts have been focused on optimizing resources across the company which includes reducing the expense base in our phone business. To date, we have integrated the manufacturing and supply chain teams across Microsoft while also rationalizing our phone manufacturing capacity.
In operating expense we committed to reducing $1 billion from the phone cost base which we have done. We continue to look for opportunities to drive further efficiencies.
Our effective tax rate was 25% and higher than expected due to previously mentioned income tax charge for an IRS audit adjustment. Beyond that, the increase was driven by the inclusion of phone results and our changing geographic mix.
Capital expenditures were $1.5 billion driven primarily by investments to increase our capacity as we expanded existing and added new data centers, as well as made server purchases and support of our fast-growing cloud business.
This quarter we increased our capital return by 5% with $4.5 billion returned to shareholders through buybacks and dividends and as Satya reinforced in his comments we will continue to take thoughtful steps to increase capital return to shareholders with a focus on value.
With that overview of the current quarter, let me now turn to our outlook. Our guidance is based on our current view of FX rates. Should the U.S. dollar strengthen beyond those assumptions as it did this quarter, we would see additional negative impact to earnings, revenue, our balance sheet and our contracted but not billed balance.
As a reminder, in our annuity businesses the FX impact is first reflected on our revenue, which is recorded at rate when the contract is billed, then revenue comes onto the P&L at that same rate as it is recognized, generally over the next year.
Therefore in Q3 we will start to recognize a higher percentage of revenue from periods with a stronger U.S. dollar than the prior-year comparison. In total, we expect that FX will negatively impact revenue growth by approximately four points in Q3. The majority of this impact is in our commercial business.
In FY '14 it was our Q2 through Q4 results that most benefited from Windows XP end of support. As such, our growth rates across Windows Pro and transactional Office will be impacted as our business moves back to pre-XP levels.
On a geographic basis, we expect year-on-year revenue declines in China, Russia and Japan. In Japan Q3 represents an even tougher comparison with the anniversary of the VAT, which again will create different comparables, difficult comparables in Windows and Office.
We currently expect that these geographic dynamics, challenging comparables from XP and FX headwinds will be in place throughout the remainder of our fiscal year.
With that overall background, let me move to our specific Q3 guidance starting with devices and consumer. Our revenue guidance includes approximately four points of drag from FX. In licensing we expect revenue to be $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion.
This range seems the more challenging comparables I mentioned earlier. The range also includes a reduction in channel inventory for Windows non-Pro opening price point PCs.
Within consumer Office we expect to see similar trends to Q2 and within our IP licensing business we expect lower per unit royalties with the changing mix of devices filled by our licensees.
In computing and gaming we expect revenue to be $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. This range reflects normal seasonality coming out of the holidays for our Xbox and Surface businesses.
In phone hardware we expect revenue to be $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. This range anticipates accelerating year-over-year growth in Lumia units driven by our affordable smartphone devices.
We also expect both volumes and ASPs of non-Lumia devices to continue to decline in Q3. With this lower aggregate revenue base, we expect gross margins, which include non-cash amortization to be lower for the next couple of quarters.
In devices and consumer other, we expect revenue to be about $2 billion reflecting continued progress in key areas like Office 365 Home and Personal, Xbox Live and Search.
In our commercial business we expect our significant momentum in annuity and commercial cloud services to continue. Within our commercial licensing segment we expect revenue to be $9.7 billion to $9.9 billion. In addition to the factors that I discussed, which impact our year-over-year comparability, we anticipate a four-point drag from FX.
In Commercial Other, we expect revenue to be $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion. Even after considering the impact of FX, growth will remain robust with expected momentum across our commercial cloud portfolio, Office 365 Azure and CRM Online and in corporate, we don't expect any revenue impact.
As we continue to work towards the launch of Windows 10, we will share additional detailed information regarding any accounting impacts from the Windows 10 free upgrade offer and Windows as a service.
I would like to reiterate that our OEM royalty model, which is paid upfront will remain in place. We expect COGS to be $7.1 billion to $7.4 billion with variability driven by both hardware segments. We expect third-quarter operating expense to be $8.2 billion to $8.4 billion. We are lowering our full-year guidance to $33.2 billion to $33.6 billion which reduces full-year growth including NDS to 4% to 5%.
Our Q3 plans include investments in advertising and customer facing roles to continue to accelerate our momentum with commercial products such as SQL and the cloud. These investments are a direct result of prioritization decisions made during first half.
Over the remainder of the fiscal year we expect to incur an additional $200 million of restructuring expense. This results in total charges of roughly $1.4 billion which is lower than our previous guidance.
Separately, we still expect integration expense of $100 million per quarter for the remainder of the fiscal year.
As a reminder, other income and expense includes dividend and interest income offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging. Given the current FX environment, we expect other income and expense to be negative $100 million in Q3.
We now expect our full year tax rate to be between 22% and 24%, this includes the Q2 income tax charge for an IRS audit adjustment as well as the changing geographic mix of our business. In Q3 we expect CapEx to sequentially increase in support of our growing cloud business.
Unearned revenue will continue to benefit from customers moving to our subscription services and high contract renewal rates. We expect to see low single-digit sequential decline in our unearned for Q3 which includes one point drag from FX as new billings will reflect the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar. Our commercial unearned balance will follow recent historical seasonality when adjusted for FX.
In closing, this quarter was another example of the progress that we are making across this company. Our execution continues to improve and we are making data-driven decisions to improve more investments both shorter-term as you have seen in our marketing and sales adjustments as well as for the longer-term as we adjust our product portfolio.
There are certainly short-term comparability challenges as we anniversary last year's XP Refresh cycle and see the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar, but we are confident in the underlying health of our business out of the significant innovation we are funding within our prioritized operating budgets and excited to continue gaining share in key strategic markets.
Before I hand it back over to Chris, I would like to announce that we will be webcasting a briefing for the investor community on April 29, in conjunction with our Build Developer Conference in San Francisco. We will share more details as we get closer to the date.
With that, I will turn it back over to Chris and we can move to Q&A.
Chris Suh
Thanks Amy. With that, we will now move to the Q&A. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein. Please proceed with your questions.
Mark Moerdler
Thank you very much. I appreciate. Amy, can you give us a bit more details on what's driving the increase in cloud margins within the commercial other segment as well as any sense for how accretive the cloud is becoming? And then I have a follow-up question.
Amy Hood
Sure, why don’t I talk a little bit about that from a math perspective and I'll let Satya add from some more engineering improvements, which I think are important.
Mark, as I talked a bit about, we've seen a mix shift as we have moved Office 365 and Azure to our premium service and to premium SKUs within our cloud environment, that is one of the drivers that helps improve margin growth.
In addition, we've done a lot of hard engineering work I believe over the past six quarters to be able to take advantage of more utilization and capacity over time and I'll let Satya maybe add a little bit technically.
Satya Nadella
Overall, the shift to the higher layer services is the real driver here, which is obviously Office 365 and its various levels is one factor. The other one is what I talked about in the Enterprise Mobility Suite, that's really got fantastic momentum in the marketplace because the solution has really come together and is fairly unique, as well as Dynamic CRM.
So these are all got a different profile in terms of margin and they are all now pretty high growth businesses for us. So when you think about our cloud, you got to think about the low-level infrastructure. Even there we now have premium offerings and then we have higher level services. So that aggregate portfolio is what helps us move up the margin curve.
Mark Moerdler
Excellent and one quick follow-up, how should we think about monetization Satya for the Windows devices sub 9 inch?
Satya Nadella
One of the comments I had made in my remarks was some momentum we're seeing in our consumer cloud services. So for example, the store monetization, Bing monetization, Xbox Live monetization as Xbox Live monetization as Xbox Live now in fact is going to span devices are all things that drive monetization for below 9 inches.
So I think of device gross margin in some cases because we are building devices like the phones as well as this post sale monetization using our consumer cloud services as the two additional levers that we have in order to be able to monetize Windows devices.
Chris Suh
Excellent, thank you, I appreciate Mark.
Chris Suh
We'll move to the next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please proceed.
Brent Thill
Thanks. Amy, just on the XP tail-off, are there other commercial products that you're seeing being impacted? I just wanted be clear there are a lot of questions that is there some type of Halo impact from the XP taking drop down on the other solutions?
Amy Hood
Sure Brent, thanks for the question. I think it's the exact product portfolio that we talked about last year when the impact was happening, so let me take this opportunity to sort of walk you through those components again.
Obviously there's a very direct impact, which we've talked the most about in terms of Windows Pro and its mix would attach to business PCs.
The other important component of that was when people bought a PC as we talked through the year, they often took the chance whether generally in the business segment which impacts in our world commercial licensing as a reporting unit to buy Office and generally on a non-annuity basis.
So if you think about that being the next major transactional type purchase that was driven a year ago as the first externality, the second was in Windows [DL] [ph] we also saw non-annuity purchases in Windows DL which again is in our commercial licensing segment.
So if you think about it from a product portfolio, it really is Windows and Office. If you think about it from our reporting segments it's the D&C licensing segment as well as our commercial licensing segment and specifically our transactional revenue growth year-over-year.
Brent Thill
Okay. And just a quick follow-up, just on the reduction in operating expenses for the full year, is this across the Board Amy? Is there a particular area that you're finding more opportunity to cut?
Amy Hood
Brent, thanks again. I actually think of it as a general concept. I think really we're trying to invest behind opportunities where we see them. Some of those are more public as we talk about in terms of our sales and marketing adjustments or Ad campaigns that we run by the commercial cloud.
Others I think you don't have the opportunity to see until we launch products like we did last week where we were able to reassert our product portfolio and really move our talent to invest in, I guess mind blowing is the word Satya used, in terms of product portfolio in that way.
So I'm not sure that all of it Brent I would say is across a line in that way. They're short-term optimizations and longer-term portfolio optimizations that I think we've talked about this before.
I think the entire Senior Leadership Team views it as an opportunity to think about where we can best innovate and drive the highest value of every dollar that we invest and I think we've made great progress as a team and I think you're seeing that both in the long-term guidance and in frankly our day-to-day execution through the quarter.
Brent Thill
Thank you.
Satya Nadella
And I will just add that we're also making pretty significant changes in just the very workflow of our engineering teams and that also leads to us getting more out of our current investments. So there is significant I would say combination of culture change as well as how we work change that drives more innovation for the same dollar.
Brent Thill
Thank you.
Chris Suh
Thank you, Brent. We will move to the next question please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citigroup. Please proceed.
Walter Pritchard
Hi thanks. Two questions, just one on execution it sounds like you highlighted some issues in Japan and we've heard about VAT from companies. Can you just talk about what you're doing to address some of those issues and is there any concern that that might spread beyond what you've seen in Japan and China?
Amy Hood
Thanks Walter. Is that both your questions, I just want to make sure I get them?
Walter Pritchard
No, I'm just trying to understand generally that issue, I had one other, but it's just on…
Satya Nadella
I'll just start by just talking about China. We have in China currently a set of geopolitical issues that we are working through. We're very committed to China as a market. We have in fact pockets of good growth in China with our cloud doing fairly well, but at the same time we're grounded that in the fact that we need more work to do and we're working through them and then as and when they will work out, we will let you know.
Amy Hood
And I'll talk a little bit about Japan and Walter to answer your question, I don't have any concerns if that expands such that in this unique issue beyond Japan, with the Windows end of XP plus the VAT increase, I do think, as well as some of the macroeconomic environments, it tightened far faster than we had anticipated and Japan in particular because of its model for us, it is a non-annuity geography for us.
So impacts in Japan more directly come to the P&L as opposed to on our under C&B balances and that's why this quarter, you saw some weakness in commercial licensing, but when adjusted for FX, our unearned balance and bookings actually felt quite good from our commercial perspective.
Walter Pritchard
And then just question on the Office 365 commercial, can you talk about deployment rates. I know you've done a good job of getting those into contracts, how many customers are actually running it, running their email and share point and other products in the cloud versus just having the rights to it.
Amy Hood
Thanks Walter. I think with all products, I think about the complete sales cycle and I am really encouraged by the fact that we're doing a good job of moving from the initial sales through deployment, through adding on services and back to renewals and I think the importance of that customer lifecycle is really how we think about our workloads and our workload health in the cloud.
The workload that we're furthest along on is obviously exchange. It happens also come with directory implementation and so we generally think of a fast deployment also and then adding on workloads and premium workflow cycles.
And then as you might imagine, that provides an interesting environment for us to add on some of the products actually that Satya mentioned very directly in his comments such as EMS or Enterprise Mobility Suite.
So while I think there is always a lag, the actual goal is the commitment that the customers show to the movement to the cloud and then moving them quickly as we can, but also at their own pace through deployment.
Walter Pritchard
Great. Thank you.
Satya Nadella
Thanks Walter.
Chris Suh
We'll move to the next question please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Keith Weiss
Excellent. Thank you, guys for taking our question. I just wanted to dig into Windows OEM ASPs a little bit and just trying to sort of better understand the dynamic theme of what we see in the marketplace when we look at industry analysts that we're looking at basically sort of flat to slightly down unit growth and the down 13% OEM revenue growth that you guys are seeing.
Some of this mix and some of this ASP, I was wondering if you could help us with a little bit more color in terms of exactly what that ASP dynamic is going on in terms of these lower entry level additions what's that doing to the overall ASP of what you're able to extract from the market?
Amy Hood
Thanks Keith. I'll take the opportunity actually to do it for both Pro as well as non-Pro because I wasn’t sure which category you were talking about. Let me start at the highest level, which is if I work at industry analyst as well as many of our peers in the ecosystem, I actually think we agree with most of the benchmarks in terms of PC unit health across business, which has been stable since FY '13 and across consumer where we see meaningful progress made in unit growth both last quarter and especially this one.
So then I'll take a second and talk about sort of the distinction between the revenue growth versus the unit growth. Let me start first in Pro. There they're really two key dynamics, the first is the return to the XP levels that we saw prior to the XP refresh.
They're consistent, the dynamic mix in terms of emerging markets and developed as well as enterprise sizing is not an ASP problem in Pro. It is a return to the attach level we saw before.
The component that actually has impacted -- the second component in Pro that is a quote unquote “ASP/mix comment” is the academic licenses that I referred to earlier where we did lower the price and saw an increased unit number. So that was a second component of the revenue piece, but the larger component was the XP reversion and again that's not an ASP comment.
When you come to non-Pro, I think this really refers back to Satya's comments, which is we saw device growth in low price devices opening price points, we actually made I believe a strategic decision to increase our ability to put devices on the shelf, especially at retail at prices under $200 to $249 is how to think about the price points that were the most impacted.
We do have the Windows with things skewed there. It is a lower RPL than our traditional non-Pro OEM licenses, but I do believe it drove meaningful ecosystem health and as well drove good competitive dynamics in the channel.
And so overall while it did have an RPL impact, which does explain along with mix shift, the minus 13% in non-Pro OEM versus the PC license growth that we saw, I think really Satya covered the actual logic to that in terms of overall ecosystem health as we feel quite good about.
Keith Weiss
And if I could squeeze in one follow-up, have you guys done any assessment in terms of the set you're seeing in Surface Pro 3 definitely is a real productivity device. To what extent is that cannibalistic from what would have been Windows PC sales and to what extent do you think you're expanding the market opportunity with that device?
Satya Nadella
I think it's definitely expanding the market opportunity. One of the things that I feel very good about is the risk we took to introduce the two-in-one category and I feel now that we see that in fact inspire even a lot of activity in our own OEM ecosystem and we see many good designs coming because it's viewed as a category that drives growth.
And so from that perspective I feel good about leading because that's one of our strategic goals, which is we want to create new categories, foster more demand for the entire ecosystem.
Keith Weiss
Excellent. Thank you very much guys.
Amy Hood
Thank you.
Chris Suh
We'll take the next question please operator.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rick Sherlund with Nomura. Please proceed.
Rick Sherlund
Thanks for Satya, could you talk about the implications of Windows 10 for a moment? I am thinking in terms of the new platform for innovation and maybe you can talk about post-sale monetization. What do you think the impact is on demand in the industry and the opportunities for Microsoft around the new platform?
Satya Nadella
Thanks Rick for the question. As I said in my remarks, I am very optimistic about what Windows 10 means for our customers, partners and Microsoft. The core idea of Windows 10 is to build a device operating system that spans the gamut from no screens to small screens, to PCs and even large screens.
In fact if you look at our innovation, we're perhaps unique in the large screen innovation that we're doing with Surface Hub, Hollow Lands as well as some of the two-in-one form factors.
So overall I think the most strategic objective for us is to get developer momentum with Windows 10 and that's where we're focusing on with a lot of different actions. One is the one unified developer platform, which I think is perhaps the most strategic piece of Windows 10 along with the unified store.
And now couple that with the call we've made to provide an upgrade offer. We're creating great opportunity for every developer to write these universal windows application that will run on the desktop as well as on our phone and tablets, as well as on Surface Hub and in fact Hollow Lands runs universal applications.`
No one else provides that kind of a unified market place for developers and especially the changes we've made to the desktop user interface means these universal applications are in fact very naturally discoverable right where we have high usage, which is the desktop.
So that's the combination of things that we think are going to play out effectively and of course we're in beta right now or previews right now and getting daily feedback across the length and breadth of Windows 10, but overall I am very optimistic of what it means, both as a platform as well as a set of end user features.
Chris Suh
Thanks Rick. Operator, we'll take the next question please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Phil Winslow
Thanks guys. Just got a question on the commercial other line, obviously that continues to show strong growth and have been climbing up in the cloud business whether it be Azure, Office 365, but I just wanted to double click on the Azure side.
Wondering if you could help us parse through sort of the infrastructure server as in the platform as server side and the trends there and any sort of joint benefit I guess that you're seeing and being able to offer both as to and also such as this business does scale and then Amy. I would love you to chime in hereto, how do you think about the gross margin and just operating margin characteristics once again as the revenue just continues to grow here?
Satya Nadella
Thanks Phil. So let me start. Overall, what we're seeing is, clearly there is increased usage of infrastructure as a service because a lot of people will move an existing workload into the cloud.
But the interesting thing that happens once you move your initial workload is you build around it. Especially for example, if you move a VM with some data into the cloud, you may want to use the same data to build a mobile front end and that’s when you're starting to use some of our platform as a service components like our Azure Mobile Services, Azure Media Services.
So we see the combination and they're not all happening coincident, but there is time lag in it but therefore that’s one of the reasons why we want to be very aggressive in getting the workloads on to Azure both storage and compute; and even in the storage and compute, we now have premium offerings for higher SLA, for higher performance, higher VM sizes and then on top of that, we have these managed services which have a different margin profile.
So media services, mobile services, WAB which is another place where we actually have lot of traction. And then that’s all just on Azure.
Once you get beyond Azure, you have things like CRM Online, you have enterprise mobility suite and of course the Office 365 line up and when we think about our capital and in fact the core infrastructure, we don’t have different infrastructure for these different services.
It’s one common infrastructure and one common data center footprint between O365 Azure, CRM, Xbox Live everything. So that’s why utilization of that entire infrastructure is how we think about even total return on invested capital for our cloud business.
Phil Winslow
Great.
Chris Suh
Thanks Phil. We'll move to the next question please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Heather Bellini
Great. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to follow up Amy, your commercial other business continues to have fantastic growth and I am just wondering when you juxtaposed that with the growth in the commercial licensing business, I heard you in terms of the headwinds that you faced.
But when we think about it more than one quarter out and think about the revenue transition as you guys continue to build market share in the cloud, how do we think about the trends in the commercial licensing business in the next year or so?
Amy Hood
Let me -- I think in general, let me start by saying all -- all up right. So in our commercial business, I think we’ve done a very good job of continuing to outpace IT spend on an overall basis by continuing to push customers to our annuity business whether they are on -- on premise or the cloud. That is our strategic goal as well as impacts in both segments.
Now let me talk about sort of uniquely commercial licensing and how to think about it. While I won’t give specific guidance, I will talk about how to think about the impact in particular from XP.
Our transactional revenue will have a headwind from XP. That doesn’t and shouldn’t be interpreted as customers not continuing to be committed or not committing to move to annuity over the longer term, which is exactly I think the question that you're asking.
And so while we have a comparability issue that will show itself most directly as weakness in commercial licensing and most specifically as weakness in Office transactional licensing which will be a headwind, the overall goal of continuing to have more customers every quarter move to the cloud or whether or not they move, adding cloud services even if they have on prem because they believe in a hybrid model, is actually the structural guide post we have on a multi-year -- on a multi-year journey.
Chris Suh
Thanks Heather. Operator, we'll move to the next question please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.
Raimo Lenschow
Okay. Thanks for taking my question. Two quick questions. Satya, I wanted to follow up on Phil Winslow’s question earlier on the -- on Azure and the used cases there. In theory you have a huge opportunity given your install base on the server side.
Can you talk a little bit about what -- what you're seeing the SMB customer base doing. Are we kind of in it? People trying bursting or where is that huge customer base in terms of adoption on Azure?
Satya Nadella
On Azure itself, one of the other elements that I did not actually talk about in response to Phil’s question is the hybrid offering. One of the products that's doing very, very well for us is the store simple product, which is essentially a storage product that cloud Tiers virtualization storage from on-premise to the cloud.
We also have built now into windows server backup and disaster recovery, same thing with SQL server. So that's the first thing that we're seeing is increased usage of our servers with the cloud component.
Bursting is something for sure a lot of people do but that’s more on the high end because in the SMB segment, the real movement there is more to Office 365.
In fact, one of the things in Office 365 is we're getting people to effectively use servers, which now happens to be in cloud who never bought servers from us ever before because they didn’t have exchange, they didn’t have link, they didn’t have any of the core capabilities of Office 365. So those are the two trends we're seeing.
Raimo Lenschow
Perfect, and a quick follow-up for Amy, if you look at the changes on the operating side that you talked about, it obviously seems to -- as a cultural shift. What’s more, if you budget, it’s more dynamic budgeting it's very much a return base culture that you seem to be introducing here.
But it’s something that kind of needs to be feed through the organization and it’s more a cultural change. Where are you in terms of like innings in terms of having it fully through the organization?
Amy Hood
Thanks for that question. I think we've talked about this in prior quarters while I think many people want to see it as a finance concept, it’s not. It’s a senior leadership team concept and the leadership environment that I think we're making collective decisions faster.
I think we are applying our resources to opportunities when we see them. I think we have a freedom to make those choices quickly and I feel very good those about the decisiveness that comes with it, but also the empowerment that we give to people within our organizations to make those calls, to increase our performance without waiting to an annual budget process.
I think some people call it dynamic budgeting. I think for us, I think it’s more about -- thinking about opportunities we have and stack ranking those every day to improve both our execution and our returns.
Raimo Lenschow
Thank you.
Chris Suh
Thanks. We'll move to the next question please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities. Please proceed.
Brendan Barnicle
Thanks so much. Amy, when we first started talking about Office 365, I think at that time, you were suggesting that the move from an Office CAL to an Office 365 license would increase gross profit by about 50%.
Now that you had a couple of quarters with Office 365, do you think those changes to the model still make sense and more importantly, are there may be other changes that you're seeing that are more accurate?
Amy Hood
Thanks for the question. In general, I think we're still on the early ends of seeing the opportunity that we have in that segment.
As you pointed out, there is a couple components that make gross profit dollars per seat or the life time value of a customer depending on the terms you want to use improve and increase over the life cycle.
The very first thing and I think Satya even mentioned it in its most direct in SMB is moving from buying a copy of Office, which was a very static concept to the idea where you could buy Office and frankly get all the benefits that those who used to deploy servers used to get only with IT departments of their own.
So as you move Office, it’s simply the first step. So, even though obviously it comes at a little lower gross margin percentage, our ability to add workloads, add premium services and to increase our overall footprint inside a customer is really where the life time value goes up.
And frankly over time and watching, I think both the creativity and the pace of innovation we’ve seen coming out of our engineering teams particularly in Azure and Office 365 and our CRM team online, I actually even have more confidence in our ability to attach and grow that gross profit over time.
We mentioned simply one that didn’t exist I think Brendan when we first started having this conversation, which was our EMS suite and I look and say, those opportunities as well as the creativity of our people I think gives me more confidence if not less in the structural integrity of the lifetime value of a customer argument.
Brendan Barnicle
Great. Thank you so much.
Chris Suh
Thanks. Operator, we will have time for one last question please.
Operator
Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Ed Maguire with CLSA. Please proceed.
Ed Maguire
Yes. Thank you. Over the last several quarters and particularly Satya, you’ve opened up a number of the products to different platforms, Office in Android and with Minecraft and Skype, you've got a number of really multiplatform products and services.
Could you quantify so far to what extent you’ve seen benefit and as this plays into the free upgrade for Windows 10 at least for a limited period, how you expect this to play out benefitting the business case of your products across the portfolio?
Satya Nadella
Yeah so overall at the highest level, our strategy here is to make sure that the Microsoft Services i.e. cloud services be it Azure, Office 365, CRM Online or Enterprise Mobility suite are covering all the devices out there in the marketplace.
So that, that way we maximize the opportunity we have for each of these subscription and capacity based services. So that’s the core rational for why we are doing cross platform.
Now the next question is what’s the uniqueness of Windows? And the uniqueness of Windows comes because we don’t think of these services and their application end points as apps, but fundamentally core to the Windows experience. So we are building them natively into windows.
So for example, when you log into Windows, you are logging in with Microsoft account or Azure ID. When you have files, they are synching with one drive. Outlook is the email client for Windows. So that’s how Windows will differentiate and not to mention, our Gaming and Xbox Live experiences.
So overall, we will build a differentiated Windows because our application experiences for our cloud end points will be native in windows and at the same time, we will make sure that our services are available on all end points driving more usage, more subscription growth. So the best way to measure our progress is Office 365 subscription growth, Azure growth and EMS growth.
Ed Maguire
Great. Thank you.
Chris Suh

And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Satya.
Satya Nadella
Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon everyone. Three month ago I outlined how Microsoft is the productivity and platform company for the mobile-first cloud-first world. Since then we have galvanized around this direction and are executing well. I am proud of the results we’ve delivered this quarter across all businesses. Results are up in every category from commercial to consumer to hardware. With $23.2 billion in revenue for this quarter, we’re off to a great start to the year. More importantly we’re also pleased with the progress we’ve made in evolving our culture to be fast, innovative partner-friendly and customer obsessed.
As I reflect on this past quarter, there are four important indicators of progress that I want to highlight: cloud, Windows, hardware and finally I’ll talk about our ecosystem momentum.
First, our cloud offering continue to grow at a rapid rate. More people in organizations are signing up and we are generating more revenue across both commercial and consumer customers. Our commercial cloud revenue grew a 128% year-over-year, the fifth consecutive quarter of triple-digit growth. In fact we’re the only company with cloud revenue at our scale that is growing at triple-digit rates. An 80% of the Fortune 500 are now on the Microsoft Cloud.
Office 365 commercial seats nearly doubled, two out of every three new customers see our premium versions. Consumer Office 365 now exceeds 7 million subscribers, up more than 25% for the last quarter alone. We continue to invest in growing our leadership position in areas with great opportunity. To that end, we’re expanding our data center capacity to meet demand, provide the best customer experience, enable data solvency and deliver continuous innovation.
As you are seeing robust growth because of our unique approach as the only hyper scale public cloud provider with enterprise great capabilities and true private cloud and hybrid cloud offerings.
We continue to add new features and capabilities faster than ever based on user feedback cycles. One major Azure service of feature is released every three days on average, opening up many more new user scenarios for our customers.
Our premium services on Azure create new monetization opportunities in media, data, machine learning and fast analytics and enterprise mobility. More than 60% of the Azure customers are now using at least each one of these premium services such as Enterprise Mobility Suite, which is off to a very fast start.
Top 10 [IVs] love our open and flexible approach and are building on Azure at a rapid pace. In fact 40% of Azure revenue now comes from startup NISD. Even with our tremendous growth in public cloud, we are still seeing strength in our on-premise businesses with double-digit growth across Windows Servers, SQL Server, System Center and Dynamics. This is because of the unique hybrid and private cloud capabilities that are built into our service.
The second indicator of progress is the improvement in the overall health of the Windows ecosystem in the first quarter. We introduced and expanded set of Windows offering which helped drive consumer unit growth in quarter one and will provide incremental opportunities for use of Microsoft services such as Bing.
With these new offerings, OEMs are delivering exciting new devices at extremely attractive price points, including Windows PCs at 199 and below.
In September, we took the first steps in publicly sharing more about the next generation of Windows. Windows 10 will unlock new experiences for customers to work, play and connect across an incredibly broad set of devices with screens from 4 inches to 80 inches and even IOT devices.
Windows 10 will deliver a single unified application development platform, one way to write a universal app across the entire family of Windows devices and one store with the unified way for applications to be discovered, purchased and updated across all these devices.
Think about it, with Windows 10 developers can build one app and thus expand billions of devices. When I talk about putting customers at the center of everything we do, it’s especially true for Windows with incorporating customer feedback earlier than ever in the development cycle especially with our enterprise customers.
This will be the best Windows release ever for businesses. And with hundreds of thousands of pieces of feedback flowing into the team already, Windows 10 will be the most collaborative version of Windows we have ever shipped.
Third, I want to highlight some specific markers of advancements in hardware and gaming. Across the entire hardware portfolio, I’m encouraged by the reception from customers and our continuously improving execution.
Surface had strong results this quarter driven by positive customer response to Surface Pro 3. The product line up is the right one and customers are responding favorably. Surface Pro 3 is now in 28 markets and importantly we have improved the business economics of this product line. With phone, we have move quickly to integrate the business. We are executing on all of the restructuring changes we talked about in the last quarter while driving Lumia share growth. We saw modest growth over the prior year driven by sales in Europe where we gained share with lower price devices.
Now let’s talk gaming. As I previously said, gaming is an important category that will drive additive business value for Microsoft. It is a single biggest digital live category measured in both time and money spent across devices of all type. We launched Xbox One in 28 markets, increased console unit sales from a year ago, and grew users of Xbox LIVE apps by more than 20%. The acquisition of Mojang which we expect to close in November, extends our ecosystem and community across multiple platforms. Minecraft adds to our already strong portfolio of first party games and contents such as Halo and will strengthen our gaming experiences on PCs and consoles as well as cross-platform monetization.
The fourth and final area I want to focus on today is the renewed energy and momentum in our partnerships. As a productivity and platforms company, we create vast opportunity for our partners through moving fast to extend our platforms and tools to reach more customers through partnerships; from SAP and Oracle to Salesforce, Adobe and IBM to the latest partnerships we announced this past week with Docker, Cloudera and CoreOS. Great partnerships emerge from great products, strong momentum and the shared enthusiasm about a long-term vision.
Technology leaders across the board recognize the customer value inherent in products like Office 365, Azure and Windows. And they want to align their businesses with our healthy and growing ecosystem. You’ll see more partnerships in the months ahead. It’s the best way to deliver the best possible experience for our customers in today’s heterogeneous mobile-first cloud-first world.
In summary, I am pleased with the progress we’re making, things all across the company are rallying around our core focus to reinvent productivity and create platform for a mobile-first cloud-first world. We will continue to drive the changes that will position us for the future. We will be accountable to our customers, partners and shareholders, and we will be relentless in looking for areas to invest for long-term growth.
With that Amy will go through our Q1 results in detail and share our outlook for Q2 and then I’ll join her for Q&A. Thank you very much.
Amy Hood
Thanks and good afternoon everyone. As Satya said, we had a very strong start to the fiscal year. We made meaningful progress with improved execution across all our businesses. I am encouraged by what we have achieved and believe we’re well positioned for the future.
With that said, let me take you through the financial highlights of our first quarter. Revenue was $23.2 billion, up 25% over last year and up 11% excluding phone. Earnings per share were $0.54 which included an $0.11 negative impact from integration and restructuring expenses. Excluding that impact, EPS grew 5% to $0.65, even after considering the impact of the phone business on profits.
We’re accelerating the pace of decision-making and taking decisive actions to improve how we operate. This approach is reflected in the progress we’ve made in restructuring the company and integrating our phone business. As a result, we incurred charges of $1.1 billion this quarter.
Geographically, we saw a strong performance across the U.S. and Europe and consistent with Q4, a more challenging environment in China and Russia.
Let me now discuss our results in greater detail. Our commercial business had another strong quarter. Revenue grew 10% and unearned revenue grew 12%. Renewal rates were higher than what we’ve seen in the recent first quarters. And in Office, one-third of renewals included Office 365. Importantly, we are seeing a mixed shift from on-prem to the cloud, from transactional purchasing to annuity and from standard to premium versions.
Our commercial cloud services continued their exceptional trajectory with another quarter of triple-digit growth. We’re investing in higher level services and new scenarios in Azure enabled by the scale, cost and flexibility of the cloud. And these services are expanding our addressable market. We’re adding new users and importantly growing revenue from existing on-prem customers who have adopted Azure services. Our on-prem data platform infrastructure product continue to have strong momentum with an ongoing shift to premium version. Revenue from premium skews was up 25% this quarter.
Office 365 had another terrific quarter and remains on path to becoming the unparalleled leader for cloud-based productivity apps. CIOs are selecting Office 365 as the center piece of their hybrid productivity solutions as they look to meet the growing mobile needs of their employees. SMBs are also realizing the benefits of Office 365 and as a result are moving from transactional purchasing to subscription. And as Satya mentioned, we’re seeing good partnership momentum as other companies look to integrate other 365 into their products.
Turning to Windows. Windows OEM Pro revenue performed in line with the business PC market and volumes were more consistent with those seen before the XP Refresh in fiscal ‘14. Windows volume licensing grew 10% as business customers continued to value the platform security and manageability.
During the quarter, we took important steps to grow Windows usage and improve the health of the ecosystem. Both our existing and new OEM partners are bringing to market an expanded set of device offerings at more competitive price points. Channel inventories are higher than they were last year reflecting confidence from our OEM partners heading into the holiday quarter.
IP licensing revenue declined this quarter as our license fees fill the higher mix of low-cost devices was generated lower per unit royalty. Consumer Office revenue inclusive of our subscription offerings grew 7% this quarter. Within this, we saw an accelerated transition to Office 365 Home and Personal and contributed to a decline traditional Office license revenue. Overall, it’s important to note that we continued to grow attach to consumer devices.
In Bing, revenue was driven by both volume and rate growth, began deliver double-digit monetization gains driven by investments in both relevance and ranking algorithm. These improvements keep us on the path to Bing profitability in fiscal ‘16. And consistent with prior quarters, display revenue remains under pressure.
We are excited by Surface Pro 3 performance as unit sales are pacing at twice the rate of what we saw with Pro 2. We’re seeing strong interest from students, professionals and increasingly enterprises who are replacing their laptops and tablets with Surface Pro 3 for their productivity needs. Gross margin for Surface was positive this quarter.
Within gaming, our results reflect a growing console market, our improved competitive position with the new Xbox One SKU and the launch of Xbox One into new geos including the initial channel sales with the launch in China at the end of Q1.
As we head into the holiday season, we’re looking forward to the differentiated content that will be available on the Xbox platform including Sunset Overdrive which launches in late October and Halo: The Master Chief Collection which launches in early November.
In Phone Hardware, the focus of the quarter was on positioning the business for the future. And we remain committed to reaching breakeven in fiscal ‘15.
As part of our restructuring efforts, we started vitalizing our manufacturing capacity, create one development team to accelerate the pace of innovation and focus our sales and marketing efforts on Lumia, which grew in several key markets. Sales of non-Lumia phones were down driven by declines in the underlying feature phone market, as well as portfolio rationalization as we execute on our phone strategy.
Gross margin this quarter included the benefit of non-recurring items resulting from our business integration efforts. Operating expenses were favorable to our expectations as we chose to redeploy spend to projects occurring later this fiscal year. These decisions reflect our disciplined assessment as we prioritize where to best allocate our resources. Importantly, we continue to invest in developer and customer safety world to capture the opportunities in key group categories such as the cloud, Big Data and the (inaudible).
Our effective tax rate was 23% this quarter influenced by the changing mix of our business, as well as NDS operating losses and restructuring charges, some of which are not tax deductable. This quarter we had $1.3 billion off of capital expenditure. We continue to expand the capacity and locations of our data centers to deliver higher service levels, reduce latency and help meet local data compliance requirements for our global customers. Importantly, even while making these investments, we continue to shift to grow the gross margin of our cloud business.
This quarter we increased our capital return by 19% with $4.6 billion return to shareholders through buyback and dividend. As we said in September, the Board and management continue to assess our broader capital allocation strategy as they focus on increasing long-term shareholder value.
With that overview of the current quarter, let me now turn to our outlook for the second quarter, starting with foreign exchange.
Foreign exchange did not have a material impact on our Q1 results as movements were relatively late in the quarter. The following guidance is based on current FX rates, and should the U.S. dollar continue to strengthen, it will create headwinds in our foreign transactional business. The impact of FX on our annuity business was first to be reflected in deferred revenue as it is based on rates when the contract is build and then into the P&L at that same rate as the revenue is recognized.
Now moving on to guidance, starting with devices and consumer. In licensing, we expect revenue to be $4.0 billion to $4.2 billion. Remember, in Q2 of last year we recognized about $650 million of revenue from our commercial agreement with Nokia which has ended. While revenue recognition for the agreement was heavily weighted to Q2 based on contract terms, COGS recognized ratably over the course of the year. Consistent with the current quarter, IP licensing revenue will reflect lower per unit royalties with the changing mix of devices sold by our licensees. 
With the addition of Office 365 consumer services in Japan, the transition from traditional licensing to a subscription service will negatively impact revenue by approximately $100 million in Q2. We expect the ongoing business PC refresh cycle to continue. Their comparables are challenging as we began to see the benefit of XP end of support in Q2 of last year. We expect that the consumer PC market will remain stable with many of the same dynamics we saw on Q1.
In computing and gaming, we expect revenue to be $3.5 billion to $3.8 billion. This range reflects growth in Xbox One consoles over the last year, but a mix shift to lower price SKUs announced last June. With the momentum we are seeing with Surface Pro 3, we expect units to grow sequentially.
In phone hardware, we expect revenue to be $2.0 billion to $2.2 billion. This range anticipates both year-over-year and sequential growth in Lumia units driven by the 500 and 600 series devices. As a result of the ongoing market dynamics and our portfolio rationalization, we expect those volumes and ASPs of non-Lumia devices to decline in Q2.
In devices and consumer other, we expect revenue to be $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion, which includes growth from Office 365, the launch of Halo, Master Chief Collection and continued monetization gains in [games].
In commercial licensing, we expect revenue to be $10.8 billion to $11 billion, which includes a slight drag from prior year’s estimated XP impact. With the accelerated shift to our cloud services, we expect commercial other revenue to be $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion. Overall, we expect our fundamental strength in our commercial business to continue.
And in corporate, we expect about $300 million of positive revenue impact next quarter as we recognize prior period deferrals related to bundle offerings. We expect COGS to be $9.5 billion to $9.9 billion with variability driven by both hardware segments.
We expect second quarter OpEx to be between $8.6 billion and $8.8 billion. As I mentioned earlier, our Q1 favorability was primarily driven by the timing and our continued prioritization of activities. Therefore, we still expect full year operating expenses to be $34.2 billion to $34.6 billion. And we remain committed to investing and prioritizing growth areas where we have customer momentum.
Over the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect to incur an additional $500 million of expense related to our restructuring efforts. This results in total charges of roughly $1.6 billion, the high end of the range we provided in July. Separately, we are reducing our anticipated integration expenses down to a $100 million per quarter for the remainder of the fiscal year.
As a reminder, other income and expense includes dividend and interest income offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging. We expect these items to generally offset one another. We now expect our full year tax rate to be between 20% and 22% including the impact of integration and restructuring.
In Q2, we expect CapEx to sequentially increase in support of our growing cloud business.
As you know, we typically see a decline from Q1 to Q2 on our unearned revenue balance. This Q2, we anticipate a slightly higher sequential decline in our non-commercial segments. This is primarily due to the $300 million impact from revenue recognition in corporate that I referenced earlier. We expect commercial unearned to be in line with historical trends with some of the benefit of our business model transition to annuity, offset by FX rate impact.
In closing, this was another quarter of continued growth and disciplined execution. Across the company, we’re making thoughtful data driven decisions to continually assess and prioritize our resources. We’re also investing to accelerate momentum in key strategic areas and to capitalize on emerging trends. We are making great progress in reshaping our company. And I’m encouraged by the opportunities to continue to create long-term shareholder value.
And with that, I’ll turn it back over to Chris and we can move to Q&A.
Chris Suh
Thanks Amy. With that, we’ll move to our Q&A. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions.
Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

Certainly. We’ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Brent Thill - UBS
Thanks. Good afternoon. On the commercial revenue it continues to grow at an impressive double-digit rate. Many of your peers have not been doing quite as well as you have just in the last reported quarter. Amy I know you mentioned you’re confident about this business continuing. I am curious if you could just maybe underscore what you feel you guys are doing differently than what’s happening in the peer group in underscoring that confidence going forward?
Satya Nadella
Let me start. Overall what we see is the increasing competitiveness of our products. And I think that’s really what’s reflected in our results. The cloud story I think is fairly clear at this point. The combination of Office 365, as well as Dynamics CRM in particular combined with Azure are driving our cloud growth.
As it turns out the technology that we build for our cloud is what we incorporate in our server products, in fact our R&D expense is the same expense. And that’s made our server products very competitive. And so again those our traditional competitors we’re seeing significant share gains across the entire infrastructure line of our server products in particular. And we hope to architected our cloud very differently. We are the only hyper scale cloud provider that also thinks of our server product at the edge of our cloud. So, some of the hybrid capabilities of ourselves have increasing attach and that’s also leading to our overall competitiveness, as well as monetization and margin.
And so those are the trends we see in our numbers. We live in the same macro environment as the rest. But right now we’re confident about our competitiveness driving our results.
Brent Thill - UBS
Thank you.
Chris Suh
Thanks Brent. We’ll take next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from line of Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.
Mark Moerdler - Sanford Bernstein
Thank you. And congrats on the quarter. Two quick questions on relating to cloud. Amy, can you give us a sense of what the revenue run rate for the commercial cloud was this quarter? And Satya, could you give us a little more on used cases for Azure. Is it more test-and-dev or are you seeing most of it being on the production side? Thanks.
Amy Hood
Thanks Mark. As you know, we gave our run rate at the end of last quarter at $4.4 billion and the course we’ve said in our numbers have us on that continued trajectory as we hedge for Q1. So, I think the pace and our accomplishment to share gains remain on a good trend line.
Satya Nadella
And as far as the used cases, right now it’s actually pretty diversified. We talked pretty extensively about the customer case studies at our cloud event last week. And it turns out that we have ISVs in many cases driving new applications on top of Azure. There are businesses like for example NVC that are reinventing their business models on top of Azure. We have customers using us for true hybrid, if you were deploying for example a SQL server, you can have high availability using Azure that’s a pretty common deployment now using Azure as the backplane for disaster recovery and high availability, that’s for sure is a workload. But at this point I would say, we have emerging ISVs, some of the global ISVs building SaaS applications on top of Azure driving a significant amount of growth of new businesses, the new business models emerging on Azure, as well as hybrid, which I would say are driving.
One of the other categories that I see lot of lately is IOT. And the way we participate just on the Azure side, we obviously participate even with our Windows Embedded, but on the cloud side, we are seeing the attach to our emerging machine learning services as well as advanced analytics that’s been one of the place where we are well suited for some of the emerging use cases.
Mark Moerdler - Sanford Bernstein
Thank you very much.
Chris Suh
Thank you, Mark. Next question please?
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley
Excellent. Thank you guys and very nice quarter. First, a question for Amy. Given these nice gross margin improvements across the board, but did some one-time items. So, I was hoping you could help us understand where you’re seeing sort of underlying gross margin improvements, particularly if we look at sort of any improvements that you saw in the phone gross margins as well as the big improvement we saw in the cloud gross margins, how much of that should we look at as durable on a going forward basis?
Amy Hood
Thanks Keith. Let me start with the cloud and then I’ll move to your phone question. Overall in the commercial business, I think we continue to see gross margin improvement and that is sustainable improvement as opposed to I think what you characterized as some non-recurring things that I have mentioned. It continues to be improvements in scale, improvements in our infrastructure, improvements in utilization, really strong work across all of our engineering teams here. And so I think our year-over-year improvement as well as sequential improvement and our ability in the overall commercial business, you see the gross margins we did has the mix shift to the cloud, I think we’re all quite proud of.
Onto the phone business where I did call out non-recurring items due to the business integration expense. I don’t -- easier way frankly to think about that Keith is our Q4 gross margin and our Q1 gross margin. Q4 was a little depressed is how as we think about it due to some of the restructuring; Q1 is a little bit higher. A more blended rate of those two is probably a better way to think about a go-forward margin. Although when you’re transitioning any business and all the hard work that we’re doing here to prepare ourselves going forward, I do expect to see some volatility in that number.
Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley
Excellent. That’s very helpful. Thanks very much.
Satya Nadella
Just to add one thing that I’d say is sort of -- to Mark’s question, which is in particular on Azure, we have some commodity workloads but we also have many differentiated higher margin workloads especially in the Enterprise Mobility Suite is what I’d call out is a good example of an infrastructure workload completely in the cloud that has got a very different margin structure. And those are the things that really give us the ability to have good margin structure for our cloud efforts.
Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley
Excellent. That’s great. Thank you very much guys.
Chris Suh
Thank you Keith. Next question please?
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse
Thanks guys. And congrats on another great quarter. I had a question on Office 365. Obviously, you all continue to see great growth both on the commercial and on the home and personal side. But we also saw Office commercial products and services continue to grow 5%. So one question for Satya and one for Amy. Satya, how do you feel right now about this momentum, particularly on the commercial side that you’re seeing in Office 365 and sort of how you’re targeting larger enterprises versus SMBs? Then Amy, obviously you’ve talked about some cannibalization of end period revenue from the Xbox, 365, where you could help us kind of frame that 5% this quarter on the product and services and how we should think longer term about the revenue and the profitability there? Thanks.
Satya Nadella
I’ll start and then Amy I’ll turn it over to you. Specifically on Office 365, the overall product depth and breadth is continuously improving. One of the great benefits of Office 365 that our customers get to enjoy is that as we innovate and launch new features they get to use them as soon as we have got them deployed on our cloud.
And so, that’s what’s driving both the competitiveness, as well as usage of Office 365 and quite honestly the full consumption of what we build and which I think in the long run is super important to us and our customers. But it also turns out some of the server products we have as we see increasing adoption of the cloud, we still have as I said very competitive server products, I mentioned a lot of our infrastructure server products, but take something like Lync. It’s a fantastic product, it is again gaining share in the marketplace, it’s getting deployed in on-premise solutions. So, it’s the combination that’s driving our growth.
The other dimension we’re seeing is Office 365 is cross-platform cloud service. We see now coverage across all devices and that leads to customers still using the service even more. So that combination of effects, competitive server products, very competitive cloud service with new features being added all the time, as well as cross-platform is what’s driving our growth.
Amy Hood
And let me try to take the second part of that question, Phil, which is really through the dynamics of the transactional business to move to the cloud and how I think about bridging those numbers. Our Office transactional business was down this quarter and the difference as you said because of the 5% growth is clearly the growth in Office 365 all up.
We go to a place I think always I’d like to point two in terms of triangulating when I look at the health of the overall transition is renewal rates, our renewal rates are amongst the highest we’ve had in the Q1, both our ability to recapture both the contract, as well as the revenue and the value and add services is higher than it has been. In addition, we’re seeing premium units added more frequently in the cloud than we have on-prem. And those types of mixes, you will see both bookings number, as well as in the unearned balance growth.
And so, while the exact dollars in any given quarter maybe difficult I guess to triangulate on the components. I always look to see help, I’ve outlined there specifically in the Office business.
Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse
Great. Thanks guys.
Chris Suh
Thanks Phil. We’ll go to the next question please?
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Rick Sherlund with Nomura. Please proceed with your question.
Rick Sherlund - Nomura
Yes, thanks. I wanted to follow-up on Phil’s question. I think that Office transition, our analysis suggest that’s a net benefit from here for you, I’d like Satya some thoughts maybe about the transition for the rest of the business, if you’ve got server and tools at some point, I mean it continues to show really terrific growth at some point, I suppose that becomes cannibalize by your cloud business with Azure.
Maybe Satya, if you can share how you think that transition, how long, how does it transpire or any thoughts on you shouldn’t be net additive to the revenues and operating income as we’ve seen on the Office side? Maybe if you could talk on Windows as well, it looks like OEM down a little bit this quarter, which is big than growing or we cannot see a lower ASPs with these $200 devices coming out this fall.
Satya Nadella
Let me talk a little bit about the dynamics we’re seeing in particular with our infrastructure servers, as well as Azure because it is actually pretty unique, I think to at least our product offering.
As I said, our servers have become much more competitive because of the same technology investments that we’re making in our cloud. And the used cases that we see in the cloud in many cases happen to be net new workloads, IOT was not driving our server growth traditionally, mobile backend was not driving our servers traditionally.
So, a machine learning and advanced analytics of areas we did not participate even in the past. So, one of the things that we have seen is a lot of new used cases of Azure, which were really new Greenfield territory for us. And it turns out that the need for more computing, more storage and more infrastructure server products is much broader than just even the hyper scale public cloud because the one thing that is true is there are more devices in that unit backend. And that backend in many cases in regulator industries with the GEO participation we have is needed everywhere. So one of the things that we are in fact very focused on is enabling others to build their own clouds. So, our private cloud, premium cue mix is also growing you see that in our results.
So, at least in the intermediate timeframe, we do not see cannibalization. We see more impact of this hybrid, private, as well as public cloud all being complementary. And of course being used together delivered more value to customers and that’s where our competitive advantage comes.
On the Windows side just to finish off. We wanted to make sure that we have competitive Windows ecosystem participation across all the price points. So we made some deliberate changes to our business model and that is in fact playing out in the marketplace where we now have very competitive full Windows PCs less than $199 going into this holiday season. And that in fact in Q1 caused the market to expand. That was really by design and so we are happy to see that. And so on a blended basis, of course the ASPs will be different because of the two ranges. So, but overall that’s what our goal is. We want to be able to make sure that we compete on all price points and overall grow the volume.
Rick Sherlund - Nomura
Thank you.
Chris Suh
Thanks. We’ll go to next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Walter Pritchard - Citi
Hi, thanks. Satya, I’m wondering if you can talk about, you’re seeing some progress on the cloud gross margins and you’re also investing pretty heavily. And I’m wondering how important it is for you kind of medium to long-term to be able to get things like Bing, Xbox LIVE and Office 365 running on the same infrastructure as Azure in terms of getting the kind of sale you want and ultimately driving the margins to where you want it to get to; is that sort of a prerequisite to get to where you’d like those margins to be?
Satya Nadella
Yes. I mean it’s absolute perquisite for us to have entirety of our cloud infrastructure plant drive scale economics for us. And in fact, a lot of the core Azure technology around machine management and data center management comes out of our bring efforts. We manage all of the supply chain, all of it is as one supply chain; we do SKU design as one SKU design; we drive costs of both network storage, compute down altogether. In fact you should think of Azure as the common fabric of all our applications. And you look at even some of our games like Halo, a significant usage of our cloud. And that’s what’s really driving some of the economics. In fact the first -- the fact that -- I celebrate the fact that we don’t have just one first party workload because it’s very easy for one first party workload to completely opt if you will the architecture of a cloud. But in our case, we have a very diverse set of workload. We have Xbox LIVE; we have Office 365; we have Dynamics and Bing and that diversity is what allows us to build in fact for our own needs a cloud architecture that then can meet many more workloads and that’s working pretty well for us.

Our next question comes from line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs
Great, thank you so much. Satya, I was wondering if you could share with us given the amazing XP refresh we’ve seen over the last 12 to 18 months, as you’re talking to customers, how do you feel about the corporate PC refresh cycle in calendar ‘15?
Satya Nadella
I think it will come back to the pre-XP business PC refresh. And so that’s what I think Amy’s comments also reflected and that’s what we expect to have happen in the rest of this fiscal year. The thing that Heather we are focused on is how do we make sure that not only do we -- the incremental value that we have today on Windows 8 gets adopted; there are in fact lots of use cases especially around field devices, mobile workforce where we are in fact seeing great adoption of Windows 8. But Windows 10 is something that’s completely optimized for the enterprise and across all same sizes for the mobile worker, as well as the desktop and large screens. Perhaps one of the most unique things about at least our portfolio and our innovation is that we think that it’s the mobility of the individual not the one device. That is important in the enterprise and that’s what we are building towards with great management and great security.
And so we’re pleased with the early feedback we are getting from the first disclosure of Windows 10 and as well as some of the successes we are having with Windows 8 adoption in the enterprise. But the adoption I think will get back to a normal PC Refresh in the enterprise.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs
Thank you.

Thanks Heather.

We’ll go to next question please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Ives with FBR Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Daniel Ives - FBR Capital Markets
Yes, thanks. Satya, what do you think as you move to the cloud and really try to go into this next phase of growth. Is it biggest challenge and then maybe the biggest opportunity from just a high level as we think about Microsoft going into the next stage?
Satya Nadella
I mean that’s the biggest opportunity is to be able to get into space. I mean one of the things that I always think about it, for all the success we’ve had in our server business, we were a low share player. And when I look at the total IT spend of that enterprise customers have today. As I said, we’ve not participated in many, many areas, we got even the data set. We have a very good business in SQL Server, we have perhaps the most competitive SQL Server product ever in SQL 2014, which is growing nicely. But if you look at what is secular in terms of growth going forward, it’s data, data management in a variety of new ways.
So, those are the opportunities we want to be able to take advantage of by doing some good work both in the public cloud, as well as with our server products. The challenge will always remain at the end of the day for us to make sure that we are bringing together unique offers. One of the things that I want to ask team to be very focused on is to bring uniqueness that only Microsoft can bring it to the marketplace.
That’s why it is approach around platform and reinvention of productivity, I believe is what we can do that for sure we’re going to have incredible competition. But at the same time, I think that if you ask anyone, at least in our campus whether we deeply get what it means to reinvent productivity I believe do we get deeply how to take the various constituents from end users IT and developers and harmonize their interest in unique ways so that enterprises can adopt solutions, we get that deeply. So, to me staying with that and staying focused on our unique contribution is perhaps are both on opportunity and our challenge and we will obviously index on the opportunity side.
Daniel Ives - FBR Capital
Great job on the quarter especially relative to your tech peers. Thanks.
Chris Suh
Thank you, Dan. We’ll move to next question please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of (inaudible) with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
Unidentified Analyst
Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Satya, I just wanted to get your perspective on the business mix. Still you have a very strong and growing consumer footprint especially with Nokia and then you’ve got a very solid enterprise backbone. And I feels like the consumer side of the house is pulling away much faster and obviously you’ve got some implications for how you look at the business in terms of margins and how they did potentially inflect subscriptions. If you can just give us your thoughts Satya on how you see that business mix that will be great? And also wondering, Amy, if you could shed some light on cost controls what further things that specifically the company engage in the sales and marketing expense came in at a nice surprise much lower than we expected? Thank you very much.
Satya Nadella
Thanks. The way I see the market when we sort of talk about productivity and platforms, we really don’t make this big distinction between consumer and enterprise and when it takes productivity out, we’re very focused on dual use. In fact one of the pieces of data that Amy and I shared was the growth in the consumer subscriptions of Office 365 even sequentially grew by significant percentage.
So therefore, we’re seeing good adoption of our productivity services, specifically in the context of this dual use where people want to use it at home and people want to use it at work. And that’s where in fact a lot of our R&D investment is to make that very seamless.
So, to me that’s how we want to drive and gaming is the one category we have said that we will invest in it for its own sake in driving enterprise value out of our gaming. There are in fact lots of benefits which come because of technology. In fact the reason why we are so competitive now in Cortana and speech recognition which I think is core to productivity is it first started with Connect and Xbox.
So, we’ll always have those kind of incidental benefits, but really in gaming we want to have our body gaming, Xbox LIVE console and as well as PC gaming thrive and drive more incremental value for us and Minecraft obviously helps in that context. So that’s how we’ll view the future for how we think about our businesses.
Amy Hood
And on the overall operating expense and how we’ve managed that. In general, I don’t think about it as control using that types of the word. I think what is perhaps most impressive is that we have managed to continue throughout the quarter whether it’s week-to-week or month-to-month to looking at where is the highest ROI we get from our spend, how can we drive our business forward, both in period but also for the future, it’s just as important for us to balance that. And I think we’ve done a very good job of picking those places and really investing intentionally and aggressively behind places where we know we’re differentiated.
Unidentified Analyst
Wonderful. Thank you very much, happy Halloween.
Chris Suh
Thanks [Scott]. Operator, we’ll have time for one more question please.
Operator
Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
Karl Keirstead - Deutsche Bank
Hi, thanks. Question for Amy, Amy just thinking through your guide by business segment, everything seems roughly in line for the D&C licensing guide which implies I think a 24% year-over-year decline. And given that that’s a 19% gross margin business, I just want to make sure I understand what’s happening there. And I have two questions. I am wondering if you could help disaggregate how much of that is due to the tough XP related compare versus some other perhaps one-time issues that make for a tough comparison. And then secondly, when in your best judgment do you think that D&C licensing revenue might turn positive? Thank you.
Amy Hood
Great. Karl, thanks for asking that question; it gives me a chance to reiterate how many of those components are bit one-time in nature. The first and the largest issue is the end of the Nokia commercial agreement that’s about $650 million that we earned in Q2 of a year ago that because of the ended the agreement simply goes away. So, I’ll start with that point. The second component relates to the same trend we saw in our IP business that we saw in Q4 then in Q1, we’re doing and seeing again in Q2. So, I would also see that exact same trend line and assessment.
The next component which is a change is we have actually launched some of our Office 365 consumer services in Japan, which is a Geo that we had not been in historically. That does result in a revenue to fall, it will end up in unearned. But that’s about $100 million impact that we would not have seen before that.
And so, by the time you move all of that out of the comparison group, you really get back to very similar trends in our D&C licensing business that we saw this quarter for what I think was a component to you are focused on which is OEM Pro and OEM non-Pro, which we expect to really resemble the results we saw this quarter and marry -- and to matched up PC business dynamics overall.
Karl Keirstead - Deutsche Bank
Okay. That’s very helpful. And if I could sneak in one more, Amy, the 2.9 billion share repurchase, it feels like an uptick compared to what you’ve done every quarter for the last couple of years. Is this sort of a new level that we can expect from Microsoft maybe just a thought on the pace of the share buyback?
Amy Hood
Thanks for the question. I did -- we are proud of the increase in shareholder return this quarter and importantly we’re focused on how we can continue to do that as a part of our overall long-term shareholder growth.
Karl Keirstead - Deutsche Bank
Okay.
Chris Suh

Greetings and welcome to Microsoft’s Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2014 Earnings. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Chris Suh, General Manager, Investor Relations for Microsoft. Thank you, Chris. You may begin.
Chris Suh
Thank you, Roya. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel.
On our website, microsoft.com/investor, we have posted a slide deck which provides summary of our financial results, a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures and the table of noted items to aid in understanding our results this quarter. Additionally, the slide deck contains detailed information regarding the impact of the Nokia devices and services acquisition on our financial results. Our press release is also on the website and includes an addendum with additional information about our fourth quarter performance.
Microsoft is reporting the financial performance and acquired Nokia devices and services business in a new segment called Phone Hardware. Additionally, the devices and consumer hardware segment was renamed the Computing and Gaming Hardware. The products included in this renamed segment remain the same.
Current year information reflects the financial performance of the acquired business beginning on April 25, 2014. Any reference to operating expense includes research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative, but excludes integration and restructuring charges.
Please keep in mind that all growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise specified all impacted numbers have been adjusted for non-GAAP and noted items which are detailed in our press release in slide deck. We will post the prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available.
Today’s call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission in the transcript in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website, until July 22, 2015.
During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ, because of factors discussed in today’s earnings press release and the comments made during this conference call and in the risk factor section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Amy.
Amy Hood
Thanks Chris, and good afternoon everyone. This month is an important time for Microsoft. As the leadership team we’re taking bold and decisive action to evolve our organization and culture. This includes difficult steps, but they are necessary to position Microsoft for future growth and industry leadership. Today, we’ll spend more time talking about the significant changes we’re driving. However, let me first start with this quarter’s results, after that Satya will talk more about our path forward and then I’ll share our financial outlook before we take your questions.
As I think about our strong execution this quarter, there are three things that stand out to me, significant momentum with our cloud services, progress in a number of our consumer businesses and continued cost discipline.
Our total fourth quarter revenue was $23 billion including $2 billion from the phone hardware segment. As you know our Q4 guidance did not include the impact of the acquisition of Nokia’s devices and services business. Excluding that we grew revenue 10% exceeding the high-end of our guidance range.
Moving on to earnings per share. Before the impact of the acquisition and the noted items Chris highlighted earlier, EPS grew 12% to $0.66. These details can be found in the earnings slide deck on our Investor Relations website. Geographically, performance was strong across most markets, particularly in North America and in Europe. We did, however, see challenging conditions in China or like many other multinationals we’re experiencing a weak business environment which we do not expect to change in the near term.
Our commercial cloud revenue grew 147% this quarter, driven by both Office 365 and Azure. Our commercial cloud annual revenue run rate more than doubled this year and now exceeds $4.4 billion and with this rapidly growing scale we continue to expand our cloud gross margins.
We saw strong commercial seat growth across Office 365 particularly with SMB customers. Additionally, we added over 1 million new subscribers to Office 365, Home and Personal and we ended the quarter with 5.6 million users. Azure has also grown dramatically, with storage doubling and compute tripling this year.
Along with increased usage of our core services, over 50% of our Azure customers are now also using higher value services like the Enterprise Mobility Suite, which are seeing strong adoption since the May launch. We’re pleased that our customers are enthusiastically embracing Office 365, Azure, CRM Online and our other cloud services, especially considering it’s still early in the cloud transition.
Each customer has unique deployment needs and as a result CIOs value the flexibility that our hybrid cloud offerings provide. You can see this in our commercial bookings, which grew 23% this quarter and our contracted not billed balance now exceeds $24 billion. As we previously discussed in fiscal year 2014 both the quarter and the year presented a large renewal opportunity, our differentiated value proposition combined with strong execution kept our renewal rates very high.
In addition to transitioning to the cloud, our customers continue to invest in premium versions of our on-prem server products like Window Server, System Center and SQL Server. As a result, our server licensing revenue grew 14% this quarter. We feel good about the progress we’re making with Windows. Developed markets continue to show stability and we’re encouraged by the initial response from OEMs to our new consumer offerings like Windows with Bing.
This quarter OEM revenue grew 3% as we saw the commercial hardware refresh cycle continue with businesses updating their devices and renewing their commitment to the Windows platform. XP end of support contributed to the double-digit growth in both Windows Pro and volume licensing, though the benefits moderated throughout the quarter.
In Bing, we continue to see growth in both usage and monetization. This quarter U.S. search query share exceeded 19% and RPS grew double-digits again. As we saw in prior quarters, display revenue remains soft. In late June, we launched Surface Pro 3. While it’s still early sales are outpacing earlier versions of Surface Pro and we are excited to bring the device to many more markets this summer.
During the quarter, we reassessed our product roadmap and decided not to ship a new form factor that was under development. Combined with the transition of production to our latest Surface offering, we made inventory adjustments which impacted our gross margins.
Also in June, we released our new Xbox One offering and we’re pleased with the response. At E3 we reasserted our focus on games with blockbuster titles and key exclusives coming this holiday. With the progress we are making in channel inventories, the new market for Xbox One and our exciting game line up, we feel well-positioned heading into the holiday season.
With the closing of the Nokia devices and services acquisition during the quarter, we established a new segment Phone Hardware to provide transparency into the progress we’ll make as we improve and grow the phone business. This quarter, Lumia device sales were primarily driven by good performance in the lower price point 500 and 600 series.
Sales of non-Lumia devices were in line with the overall feature phone market dynamics. Our gross margins were impacted by decisions we made to rationalize the device portfolio, as well as acquisition related amortization expense.
Across the company, we grew gross margin by $1 billion or 7%. While the faster growing cloud and hardware businesses impacted our overall company gross margin percentage it’s important to note we continue to drive margin growth in key areas with improved discipline and business process.
In D&C other revenue from search advertising and subscriptions are driving gross margin growth, in commercial other margins expanded again in this quarter benefiting from both improved business scale and datacenter efficiency in our cloud services. And we’ve made key changes to our hardware business, which have been discussed by both Satya and Stephen Elop in the past two weeks.
We’ve also kept our focus on rigorous operating expense discipline. Excluding the addition of about $750 million from NDS, our Q4 operating expense came in at the low end of our guidance. And for the full year, with disciplined decision-making, we grew revenue 9% before NDS more than twice as fast operating expense which grew 4%. Our effective tax rate was higher this quarter. Part of this was due to an adjustment to prior year taxes related to intercompany transfer pricing.
Beyond that, the increase was driven by the inclusion of NDS results and our changing geographic mix. In Q4, we returned $3.4 billion in cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends to finish this fiscal year at $15.7 billion, an increase of 28% over the prior year.
With that overview, let me turn it over to Satya to share some thoughts.
Satya Nadella
Thank you, Amy. Hello everyone. I’m proud of the results we delivered this quarter and across the fiscal year. In Q4, on an operating basis we grew revenue 10% and operating income 12%. We accelerated our commercial cloud business to a $4.4 billion annual run rate. And perhaps more importantly we made bold and disciplined decisions to define our core as the productivity and a platform company for the mobile-first cloud-first world.
Before I get into the investment principles and decisions, I want to explain how our focus on productivity and platforms leads us to participate in cloud and mobile markets. Mobility for us goes beyond just devices. While we are certainly focused on building great phones and tablets, we think of mobility more expansively.
We think the opportunity that comes from running our productivity experiences on Windows, iOS and Android device. Office 365 and dynamic SaaS offerings are targeted here. We also see great opportunity in simplifying and managing the user experiences spanning multiple devices ecosystems with our identity management, device management and data security. This is the focus of our enterprise mobility suite.
Similarly, when it comes to the cloud opportunity, we run an at-scale public cloud service and provide servers for private and hybrid clouds. Azure, StorSimple, InMage and our datacenter additions of server products across Window Server, System Center and SQL Server all help us participate in the cloud growth.
Our mobile and cloud opportunity views informs our decisions on what to build and where to invest. More specifically, we use the following three principles to guide our investments. First, focus investments on the core, productivity experiences and platform investments will prioritize across engineering, sales, marketing as well as M&A.
Second, consolidate overlapping efforts. This means one operating system that covers all screen sizes and consolidated dual use productivity services that cross life and work.
Third, run all businesses in an economically sound way. We will get crystal clear on the core businesses that drive long-term differentiation and the businesses that support them. For those supporting efforts such as MSN retail stores and hardware, we will also ensure disciplined financial execution.
Now let’s talk about the specific investments. We will be relentless in our focus on our core digital work and life experiences and the two platforms that support it, the cloud operating system and the device operating system and hardware.
Everything we do starts with digital work and life experiences to delight dual users; these are users who use technology both at work and in their personal life. This is how we reinvent productivity. Last year, we started to take steps in this direction, now OneDrive and OneDrive for business are one team. Outlook and Exchange are one team, Skype and Lync are one team all focused on those dual user scenarios.
We are clear that our experiences are going to be available on all devices. We have a specific goal for multiple Microsoft applications to be available on every home screen. This is why we brought Office to the iPad and now there are more than 35 million downloads of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote.
We believe productivity experiences will go beyond individual applications to deliver ambient intelligence that spans applications. To that end, we introduced Cortana, our personnel assistant in Windows Phone 8.1. We also believe that productivity includes group collaboration and business processes within organization.
In February, we announced our Power BI suite to help customers harness the power of big data in order to drive a data culture and greater productivity within their organizations. Power BI suite enables you to ask natural language questions, do rich visualizations and collaborate around data. Customers are loving it, in fact the average monthly users have grown over 130%.
We are pleased to see all up dynamics growth at 13% for the quarter with CRM online nearly doubling. And it’s great now to have dynamic CRM in the Gartner leaders’ quadrant in both sales and service, the two-most relevant areas in the CRM space.
Looking forward in fiscal year 2015, we are increasing our investment in R&D and sales for our digital work and life businesses even as we cut total operating expenses. We have a rich roadmap going forward. Two examples of our innovation are what we are doing with Delve and Skype Translator.
Delve is an Office 365 cloud-based service that is the first in the new breed of intelligent and social work experiences. Delve will turn enterprise search on its head as information that is relevant to you finds you. Think of this as the Facebook [new] [ph] suite for productivity.
Skype Translator will break down the language barriers in our communications and impact everything from everyday conversations with friends to education to global business.
Additionally, I’m pleased to see the progress with Bing now more than 19% U.S. query share and strong RPS growth. Going forward, we will drive our Bing related investments to contribute to the core digital work in life experiences such as Cortana, Smart Search, Delve, Power Q&A and many others. We expect Bing to be profitable on a standalone basis in FY16.
Now let’s transition to the Cloud OS. Our Cloud OS represents the fastest growing opportunity for Microsoft. Quarter-after-quarter, we drive growth and customer adoption. Our server products benefit from our public cloud. The fact that we use our servers to run our cloud make our server software the most capable enabling others to build and operate their clouds. This has led to growth in Hyper-V share, which is now at 30.6% and has helped grow datacenter additions, the Window Server and System Center both up more than 40% for the year.
We also had another breakout year for SQL server. With SQL server 14, we released industry leading in-memory technology across all database workloads of online transaction processing, data warehousing and business intelligence. And we grew our SQL business by more than 19%. Our business Azure business is growing rapidly and we further accelerated growth last year. We grew our datacenter footprint into Australia, Brazil, Japan and China while doubling our capacity in existing regions.
In FY14, we also started to see the adoption of our high-value services on top of our base cloud infrastructure. We announced the enterprise mobility suite a comprehensive cloud solution to address the consumerization of IT challenges such as Bring Your Own Device and SaaS application adoption. EMS brings together identity management, device management and data security into one IT control plane and architecture. The early data from customer adoption for EMS is very encouraging. We announced the Azure intelligence system service, our IOT service in the cloud that enables organization to securely connect manage and capture machine generated data from a variety of sensors and devices.
To support these high value services in Azure, I have prioritized acquisition such as GreenButton for Big Compute, Capptain for Mobile backend services. And just in the past few weeks InMage for disaster recovery for hybrid clouds. In FY15, we will make investments to drive this strategy forward. We will expand our Azure datacenter footprint and increase capacity in existing regions. We will launch new high level services including Azure machine learning that currently is in preview. We will expand our hybrid solutions with new services such as StorSimple, InMage as well as our server products all offering cloud tearing. We will continue to build out the EMS value proposition and we will expand our sales efforts to drive growth.
Let’s transition to our device OS and hardware, the third component of our core. In everything we do with our Windows OS and first party devices, we will line up our digital work and life experiences. We are approaching the Windows OS business with a bold challenging mindset and pushing both the product and business model forward.
We start with a focus on business customers in FY14, we saw these customers recommit to Windows. In April, we released an update to Windows 8.1. To start, we improved the core desktop experience with mouse and keyboard advancements. For Enterprises, we released Internet Explorer Enterprise Mode and extended our mobile device management capability. With Windows 8.1 update, we also lowered hardware spec required so that OEMs can build tablets and clamshells at lower price points.
In addition, we made the decision to evolve the Windows business model. Now, Windows licenses are $0 for any OEM building a device less than 9 inches. We also added a low cost Windows offering with Bing integration for OEM. This new offering combine with lower hardware spec means OEMs will bring a fantastic line up of value based notebooks and tablets to the markets this holiday.
In June, we launched Surface Pro 3. The most productivity tablet on the market today. The reason it’s the most productivity tablet on the market is because we top through the experience end-to-end. For example, one of the things you will notice with Surface Pro 3 is how it excels at note taking. You can jot down your thoughts rapidly just like with the pen and paper. To make this work in an integrated natural way, our developers pulled together one vision to right code that resides in the firmware and the Surface Pro 3 pen, the Windows shell and its inking support to reduce the [parallel x] [ph] header as well as in OneNote.
And as Amy said, we are optimistic given the early sign from the Surface Pro 3s performance in the market.
On phones, we saw a good early start to Lumia 630 and 635 as well as Lumia 930 especially in Europe. In the year ahead, we are investing in ways that will ensure our device OS and first party hardware aligned to our core. We will streamline the next version of Windows from three operating systems into one single converged operating system for screens of all sizes.
We will unify our stores, commerce and developer platforms to drive a more coherent user experience and a broader developer opportunity. We look forward to sharing more about our next major wave of Windows enhancements in the coming months. Our approach to first party hardware going forward is clear. At times, we will develop new categories like we did with Surface and we will responsibly make the market for Windows phone. However, we are not in the hardware for hardware sake, and the first party device portfolio will be aligned to our strategic direction as the productivity and platform company.
As I said before, going forward all the devices will be created with an explicit purpose to light up our digital work and life experiences. Good examples of this today are what we are doing with Surface Pro 3 for note taking and PPI for meetings. You can expect to see this type of innovation in our hardware including phones. Amy will talk more on our plans for disciplined execution on our hardware business going forward.
I want to make a few comments on Xbox. It’s important for us to have a core that’s thriving. It’s equally important to play smart bold bets in other areas where we have the ability to add value and have impact that’s what we are doing with Xbox. We made the decision to manage Xbox to maximize enterprise value with a focus on gaming. Gaming is the largest digital live category in a mobile first-cloud first world. It’s also the place where our past success a revered brand and passionate fan base present us a special opportunity.
With our decision to specifically focus on gaming, we expect to close Xbox entertainment studios and streamline our investments in music and video. We will invest in our core console gaming in Xbox live with a view towards the broader PC and mobile opportunity.
I hope you can see that we have bold ambitions and we have made a lot of progress. Also know that we are well on the way in evolving our organization and culture to deliver on these bold ambitions. This includes simplifying how we work and modernizing our engineering processes.
In all that we do, we will be accountable to our customers, partners and shareholders empowering everybody individual and organization to do more and achieve more in a mobile first cloud first world is a huge undertaking and it is one that Microsoft is uniquely qualified to take on and change the world.
Thank you. And with that let me turn it over to Amy to give you more guidance on FY15.
Amy Hood
Thanks Satya. Before going into details about our outlook, let me first say that all forward-looking information assumes the macroeconomic environment remain stable throughout this coming fiscal year.
As Satya detailed, we are taking bold steps to move Microsoft forward with a renewed sense of clarity and alignment. Our investment plan reflects those changes as to reallocate resources to aggressively drive toward our goals and pursue the highest growth and financial return businesses. Even as we invest for growth, we expect our total operating expense in fiscal year 2015 to be down from this past year before considering the addition of the Nokia cost structure and integration and restructuring cost.
Now, let me address phone separately. In fiscal year 2014, we recorded about $750 million of operating expense for the phone business for the period post the acquisition. Annualized this would have been about $4.5 billion, but we are aggressively working to drive synergies across key functions such as development, supply chain and operations as we integrate and right-size the business.
We set to realize more than $1 billion in synergies and as a result we will be on a path to reach operating break-even for the phone business in fiscal year 2016. Including phone, we expect operating expense to be between $34.2 billion and $34.6 billion in fiscal year 2015.
In addition to the expense guidance I just provided and as we announced on July 17th, we expect to incur between $1.1 billion and $1.6 billion in restructuring expense. These will be substantially complete in the first half of the fiscal year. Separately, we will also incur about $150 million per quarter in integration cost such as systems work. Similar to this quarter, we will continue to report these items in a separate line item in the income statement.
Now, let me give our view on the first quarter starting with devices and consumer. In licensing, we expect revenue to be $4.1 billion to $4.2 billion. This range reflects an ongoing business PC refresh cycle, headwinds for consumer PCs and a continued moderation of the benefits from the XP end of support.
In computing and gaming hardware, we expect revenue to be $1.7 billion to $2 billion. This range reflects the continuing ramp of Surface Pro 3 and Xbox 1 as both products are introduced into new markets in Q1. In phone hardware, we expect revenue to be $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion as we de-align the device portfolio to our strategy. And in devices and consumer other, we expect revenue to be $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion.
Moving on to commercial. We expect revenue across our two segments to be $12.0 billion to $12.2 billion within this we expect commercial other revenue of $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion. And in corporate, we expect about $300 million of negative impact next quarter. We expect COGS to be $7.5 billion to $7.9 billion with variability being driven by both hardware segments.
We expect first quarter operating expense excluding integration of restructuring to be between $8.5 billion and $8.7 billion. As a reminder, other income and expense includes dividend interest income offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging. We expect these items to generally offset one another.
We expect our full year tax rate to be between 21% and 23%. This is in line with the fourth quarter excluding the prior period tax adjustment. As a changing mix of our business, as well as the impact of the NDS acquisition will continue to influence our tax rate.
Investments in cloud infrastructure are necessary to support and enable the significant growth and momentum in our cloud services. In Q1, we expect CapEx to increase sequentially to further support our growth. Similar to fiscal year 2014, these investments are decided based on the thorough review of demand and capacity plans to ensure that the investments provide an appropriate return on capital.
We also remain focused on software driven innovation to increase the utilization and capacity of the capital we deploy. We expect our revenue to grow in line with normal seasonality.
In closing, Q1 is the start of an incredibly important year for Microsoft. We are making important changes to our organization and culture to enable and empower our people to do their very best work.
Mobility in cloud presents an enormous opportunity. And we are focusing resources on our core so we can capitalize and deliver on the next wave of innovation, growth and long-term shareholder value.
With that, I will turn it back over to Chris and we can move to Q&A.
Chris Suh
Thanks Amy. And with that we will move to Q&A. Operator please go ahead and repeat your instructions.
Question-and-Answer Session

Operator
Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.
Mark Moerdler – Sanford Bernstein
Thank you very much. I have got two parts to it. The first is Satya you have been changing the engineering processes within the company adding more analytics to the process. How do you see this change impacting both the product and the speed to go to market?
Satya Nadella
Yes. Two things, Mark. One is the diversity of products that Microsoft has from Silicon tape outs to services that we’re continuously updating in Azure or Office 365 is a lot more than let’s say when we first created the Microsoft engineering system that was for retail packaged product, so since then a lot has changed and a lot has evolved. And so what we are doing is, we are introducing new functions and new skills, design is even more important than it ever was, data analytics as you said is very important to us and they are not outside functions. They are functions that are integral to how we do product development, how we do AB testing, how we do log analysis on a continuous basis. So that’s the engineering process and culture change that we have ongoing and in fact a lot of learning from variety of different teams that’s now spreading across a lot of Microsoft.
Mark Moerdler – Sanford Bernstein
Thank you. And Amy one quick question, we saw a significant acceleration this quarter in cloud revenue, or I guess Amy or Satya, we saw acceleration in cloud revenue year-over-year what’s – is this Office for the iPad, is this Azure, what’s driving the acceleration and how long do you think we can keep this going?
Amy Hood
Mark, why don’t I take it and if Satya wants to add, obviously, he should do that. In general, I wouldn’t point to one product area. It was across Office 365, Azure and even CRM online. I think some of the important dynamics that you could point to particularly in Office 365 I really think over the course of the year we saw an acceleration in moving the product down the market into increasing what we would call the mid-market and even small business at a pace. That’s a particular place I would tie back to some of the things Satya mentioned in the answer to your first question.
Improvements to analytics, improvements to understanding the use scenarios, improving the product in real-time, understanding trial, ease of use, ease of sign-up all of these things actually can afford us the ability to go to different categories, go to different geos into different segments. And in addition, I think what you will see Mark as we initially moved many of our customers to Office 365, it came on one workload. And I think what we’ve increasingly seen is our ability to add more workloads and sell the entirety of the suite through that process. I also mentioned in Azure, our increased ability to sell some of these higher value services. So while, I can speak broadly but all of them, I think I would generally think about the strength as being both completion of our products suite, ability to enter new segments and ability to sell new workloads.
Satya Nadella
The only thing I would add is it’s the combination of our SaaS offerings like Dynamics and Office 365, a public cloud offering in Azure. But also our private and hybrid cloud infrastructure which also benefits because they run on our servers, cloud runs on our servers. So it’s that combination which makes us both unique and reinforcing. And the best example is what we are doing with Azure active directory, the fact that somebody gets on-boarded to Office 365 means that tenant information is in Azure AD that fact that the tenant information is in Azure AD is what makes EMS or our Enterprise Mobility Suite more attractive to a customer managing iOS, Android or Windows devices. That network effect is really now helping us a lot across all of our cloud efforts.
Amy Hood
Thanks Mark.
Chris Suh
Thanks Mark.
Mark Moerdler – Sanford Bernstein
Thank you, I appreciate. Congrats on the quarter.
Chris Suh
Thank you.
Satya Nadella
Thank you.
Chris Suh
Next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Brent Thill – UBS
Thank you. Amy, you’re taking a very disciplined approach on the expenses, just curious if you could help everyone understand how you are approaching that and your confidence in doing more with less?
Amy Hood
Thanks Brent. Let me actually, I’ll start and I think Satya actually will have some things to add. This is first of all I would start by saying I wouldn’t describe the behavior to me. I would describe the behavior to a senior leadership team and to a group that’s focused on investing in the core, focus on making trade-offs, focused on really accelerating our growth in key areas.
Our ability to make changes really throughout the second half of this year in particular and as we’ve led into fiscal year 2015 is really about a group focused on building and investing in something that can really be even greater than it is today. And so while I would use the word disciplined, I don’t think it’s about a person, and it shouldn’t be, it should be about an environment and which every person here thinks about how they can increase their ROI and accrue to the collective. And I think we’ve actually seen the benefits of that in the past few quarters and I think you’ll see it as we head into 2015.
Satya Nadella
I think you captured well.
Amy Hood
Thanks.
Chris Suh
Thanks Brent. Operator next question please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Keith Weiss – Morgan Stanley
Excellent, thank you for the question and a very nice quarter. First, I think to talk a little bit about the growth strategy at Nokia, you guys look to cut expenses pretty aggressively there, but this is – particularly smartphones is a very competitive marketplace, can you tell us a little bit about sort of the strategy to how you actually start to gain share with Lumia on a going forward basis? And maybe give us an idea of what levels of share or what levels of kind unit volumes are you going to need to hit to get to that breakeven in FY16?
Satya Nadella
Let me start and Amy you can even add. So overall, we are very focused on I would say thinking about mobility share across the entire Windows family. I already talked about in my remarks about how mobility for us even goes beyond devices, but for this specific question I would even say that, we want to think about mobility not just one form factor of a mobile device because I think that’s where the ultimate prize is.
But that said, we are even year-over-year basis seeing increased volume for Lumia, it’s coming at the low end in the entry smartphone market and we are pleased with it. It’s come in many markets we now have over 10% that’s the first market I would sort of say that we need to track country-by-country. And the key places where we are going to differentiate is looking at productivity scenarios or the digital work and life scenario that we can light up on our phone in unique ways.
When I can take my Office Lens App use the camera on the phone take a picture of anything and have it automatically OCR recognized and into OneNote in searchable fashion that’s the unique scenario. What we have done with Surface and PPI shows us the way that there is a lot more we can do with phones by broadly thinking about productivity. So this is not about just a Word or Excel on your phone, it is about thinking about Cortana and Office Lens and those kinds of scenarios in compelling ways. And that’s what at the end of the day is going to drive our differentiation and higher end Lumia phones.
Amy Hood
And Keith to answer your specific question, regarding FY16, I think we’ve made the difficult choices to get the cost base to a place where we can deliver on the exact scenario Satya as outlined, and we do assume that we continue to grow our units through the year and into 2016 in order to get to breakeven.
Keith Weiss – Morgan Stanley
Okay.
Chris Suh
Thank you Keith. Operator next question please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Phil Winslow – Credit Suisse
Hi, guys. Congrats on a great quarter. Just wanted to dig into Office 365, you put up another quarter of pretty impressive metrics gone up to 5.6 million home premium users, I think the commercial side grew, I think was 98% year-over-year and Satya you talked about some pretty meaningful download numbers as far as on iPad. I wonder if you could give us an update on Office 365 sort of how it’s doing versus your expectations and sort of and so what is your expectations are over the course of next 12, 18, 24 months as we continue this transition?
Amy Hood
Thanks Phil. In terms of versus our expectations, in this quarter it did do better than we expected and frankly we had quite lofty goals. So I think that is encouraging. And I think I talked about some of those key drivers in the prior question, when I think really about Home and Personal, we haven’t had a chance to talk specifically about the consumer usage and you sort of referenced Office on the iPad in your question, I think it’s really about continuing to make the subscription value whether it’s through the Home SKU or the Personal SKU have the most value to a user. It’s about a user having the opportunity to access Office, the world’s leading productivity app on the device of their choice having a light up to the very best on Windows devices and having that accrue back to our subscriptions.
And so I think our ability to execute on that over the past, I guess 18 months that we’ve had these SKUs in market is quite encouraging. I don’t really look to Office on the iPad as one item is a part of the value proposition that I think we make both in the consumer segment as well as in the commercial segment.
Phil Winslow – Credit Suisse
Okay, got it.
Chris Suh
Thanks Phil.
Amy Hood
Thanks Phil.
Chris Suh
Next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Rick Sherlund with Nomura. Please proceed with your question.
Rick Sherlund – Nomura
Thanks. I’m wondering if you could talk about the Office for a moment. I’m curious whether you think we’ve seen the worst for Office here with the consumer fall off. In Office 365 growth in margins expanding their – just sort of if you can look through the dynamics and give us a sense, do you think you are actually turned the corner there and we may be seeing the worse in terms of Office growth and margins?
Satya Nadella
Rick, let me just start qualitatively in terms of how I view Office, the category and how it relates to productivity broadly and then I’ll have Amy even specifically talk about margins and what we are seeing in terms of I’m assuming Office renewals is that probably the question. First of all, I believe the category that Office is in, which is productivity broadly for people, the group as well as organization is something that we are investing significantly and seeing significant growth in.
On one end you have new things that we are doing like Cortana. This is for individuals on new form factors like the phones where it’s not about anything that application, but an intelligent agent that knows everything about my calendar, everything about my life and tries to help me with my everyday task.
On the other end, it’s something like Delve which is a completely new tool that’s taking some – what is enterprise search and making it more like the Facebook news feed where it has a graph of all my artifacts, all my people, all my group and uses that graph to give me relevant information and discover. Same thing with Power Q&A and Power BI, it’s a part of Office 365. So we have a pretty expansive view of how we look at Office and what it can do. So that’s the growth strategy and now specifically on Office renewals.
Amy Hood
And I would say in general, let me make two comments. In terms of Office on the consumer side between what we sold on prem as well as the Home and Personal we feel quite good with attach continuing to grow and increasing the value prop. So I think that’s to address the consumer portion.
On the commercial portion, we actually saw Office grow as you said this quarter; I think the broader definition that Satya spoke to the Office value prop and we continued to see Office renewed in our enterprise agreement. So in general, I think I feel like we’re in a growth phase for that franchise.
Chris Suh
Thanks Rick. Follow with the next question please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
Walter Pritchard – Citigroup
Hi, thanks. Satya, I wanted to ask you about two statements that you made, one around responsibly making the market for Windows Phone, just kind of following on Keith’s question here. And that’s a – it’s a really competitive market it feels like ultimately you need to be a very, very meaningful share player in that market to have value for developer to leverage the universal apps that you’re talking about in terms of presentations you’ve given and build in and so forth.
And I’m trying to understand how you can do both of those things once and in terms of responsibly making the market for Windows Phone, it feels difficult given your nearest competitors there are doing things that you might argue or irresponsible in terms of making their market given that they monetize it in different ways?
Satya Nadella
Yes. One of beauties of universal Windows app is, it aggregates for the first time for us all of our Windows volume. The fact that even what is an app that runs with a mouse and keyboard on the desktop can be in the store and you can have the same app run in the touch-first on a mobile-first way gives developers the entire volume of Windows which is 300 plus million units as opposed to just our 4% share of mobile in the U.S. or 10% in some country.
So that’s really the reason why we are actively making sure that universal Windows apps is available and developers are taking advantage of it, we have great tooling. Because that’s the way we are going to be able to create the broadest opportunity to your very point about developers getting an ROI for building to Windows. For that’s how I think we will do it in a responsible way.
Walter Pritchard – Citigroup
Great, thank you.
Chris Suh
Moving to next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Heather Bellini – Goldman Sachs
Great. Thank you so much for your time. I wanted to ask a question about – Satya your comments about combining the next version of Windows and to one for all devices and just wondering if you look out, I mean you’ve got kind of different SKU segmentations right now, you’ve got enterprise, you’ve got consumer less than 9 inches for free, the offering that you mentioned earlier that you recently announced. How do we think about when you come out with this one version for all devices, how do you see this changing kind of the go-to-market and also kind of a traditional SKU segmentation and pricing that we’ve seen in the past?
Satya Nadella
Yes. My statement Heather was more to do with just even the engineering approach. The reality is that we actually did not have one Windows; we had multiple Windows operating systems inside of Microsoft. We had one for phone, one for tablets and PCs, one for Xbox, one for even embedded. So we had many, many of these efforts. So now we have one team with the layered architecture that enables us to in fact one for developers bring that collective opportunity with one store, one commerce system, one discoverability mechanism. It also allows us to scale the UI across all screen sizes; it allows us to create this notion of universal Windows apps and being coherent there.
So that’s what more I was referencing and our SKU strategy will remain by segment, we will have multiple SKUs for enterprises, we will have for OEM, we will have for end-users. And so we will – be disclosing and talking about our SKUs as we get further along, but this my statement was more to do with how we are bringing teams together to approach Windows as one ecosystem very differently than we ourselves have done in the past.
Heather Bellini – Goldman Sachs
Excellent, thank you.
Chris Suh
Okay. Thanks Heather. Next question please, operator.
Operator
Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Maguire with CLSA. Please proceed with your question.
Ed Maguire – CLSA
Hi, good afternoon. Satya you made some comments about harmonizing some of the different products across consumer and enterprise and I was curious what your approach is to viewing your different hardware offerings both in phone and with Surface, how you’re go-to-market may change around that and also since you decided to make the operating system for sub 9-inch devices free, how you see the value proposition and your ability to monetize that user base evolving over time?
Satya Nadella
Yes. The statement I made about bringing together our productivity applications across work and life is to really reflect the notion of dual use because when I think about productivity it doesn’t separate out what I use as a tool for communication with my family and what I use to collaborate at work. So that’s why having this one team that thinks about outlook.com as well as Exchange helps us think about those dual use. Same thing with files and OneDrive and OneDrive for business because we want to have the software have the smart about separating out the state carrying about IT control and data protection while me as an end user get to have the experiences that I want. That’s how we are thinking about harmonizing those digital life and work experiences.
On the hardware side, we would continue to build hardware that fits with these experiences if I understand your question right, which is how will be differentiate our first party hardware, we will build first party hardware that’s creating category, a good example is what we have done with Surface Pro 3. And in other places where we have really changed the Windows business model to encourage a plethora of OEMs to build great hardware and we are seeing that in fact in this holiday season, I think you will see a lot of value notebooks, you will see clamshells. So we will have the full price range of our hardware offering enabled by this new windows business model.
And I think the last part was how will we monetize? Of course, we will again have a combination, we will have our OEM monetization and some of these new business models are about monetizing on the backend with Bing integration as well as our services attached and that’s the reason fundamentally why we have these zero-priced Windows SKUs today.
Ed Maguire – CLSA
Great. Thank you.
Satya Nadella
Thanks Ed.
Amy Hood
Thanks Ed.
Chris Suh
Next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
Karl Keirstead – Deutsche Bank
Thanks. I wouldn’t mind focusing for a moment on the enterprise server side that’s where at least for me much of the upside came. We haven’t seen server product revenue growth in the mid teens in a while. Total Microsoft bookings 20% x Nokia haven’t seen that in ages. Perhaps the answers to these questions are related but what’s happening with those two numbers to drive the upside. I’m sure a little bit came with Azure being strong but that’s relatively small so clearly there was an inflection up on the on-prem server tools business maybe part of it was renewal rates and if that’s the answer how much more room do we have to go on that? Thank you.
Satya Nadella
I mean I will start then Amy, you can add. Overall, we have had a major revamp of our server line-up, SQL 14 being the recent one which we launched in the last quarter. And it’s the strength of our server products, I mean this is that phenomena where our servers are becoming – are become much more competitive, Windows server for virtualization and private cloud, system center for datacenter management, SQL for all the in-memory work load capabilities it has and BI. All of that has really benefited from us running our own cloud pushing our own servers to run these add scale services. And with that being in place and these refreshers we are seeing increased investment in interest on our infrastructure when it comes to data centers.
One of the things is as the public cloud is growing; we in fact don’t see it. It is for now as a zero sum. In fact, we see growth especially with the virtualization rates because people are not – overall the number of applications on mobile side are growing all of those mobile applications drive backend compute and storage. And that backend compute storage some of it goes into the public cloud, but a lot of it even goes into the datacenter. And that’s where we have a very good price performance equation and a TCO equation. And so we are being pretty competitive in grabbing share and Hyper-V share is a good example of that.
Amy Hood
And I think Karl, you are right. When you triangulate the data around our strong trend line on earned, even commercial bookings growth of 23% and the numbers you exactly talked about, it really was a combination of Office 365 cloud growth as well as we talked about the benefits of our hybrid offerings a lot of on-prem server growth as well this quarter.
Karl Keirstead – Deutsche Bank
Okay. Thank you.
Satya Nadella
Thanks Karl.
Chris Suh

Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Ives with FBR Capital. Please proceed with your question.
Jim Moore – FBR Capital
Great. Thanks guys. This is Jim Moore in for Dan. Can you just talk a little bit about the geographies mentioned in North America and Europe strength and maybe just talk a little more about the dynamics there in terms of where you are seeing this strength cloud or PC et cetera? Thanks.
Amy Hood
Thanks Jim. Actually I would say the strength across the products isn’t geographically specific. So it’s relatively consistent. We have seen cloud growth globally. We have seen on-prem server growth globally. In general, the products get launched first and often in the U.S. and so it tends to be the most mature of some of those transitional markets. But, I think in general my geographic comments are far more holistic than they are product specific.
Jim Moore – FBR Capital
Thanks very much.
Chris Suh
Thanks. Operator, we will have time for one more question please.
Operator
Thank you. And our last question will come from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
Brad Reback – Stifel
Hey, hi, how are you?
Satya Nadella
Thanks very much.
Brad Reback – Stifel
Satya, you guys did a very good job this year of returning capital to shareholders over $15 billion. Can you give us some sense philosophically, if you see a lot of opportunity for additional repurchase/dividend activity or is this a level you are fairly comfortable with? Thanks.
Satya Nadella
Thanks for the question. Overall, my comments remain the same. I answered this even in the last call, which is the approach we have taken is a balanced approach and a thoughtful approach. We are going to look at our own need to invest in order to drive growth in the opportunities we see. I think today’s conversation and results show how some of the best we have made with our cloud are paying off. And it’s great to see that momentum and it’s in fact a pretty broad based momentum across Azure, Office 365 and Amy mentioned it pretty briefly even CRM online growth. So to me that remains the core, which is being able to place our capital to drive organic growth and for the long-term health of this company.
That said, we will have a balanced approach in terms of both share buyback as well as dividends that’s the approach we have taken over the last multiple years and that will be the same thoughtful process that I expect us to do continue with going into the next fiscal and beyond.
Brad Reback – Stifel
Great. Thanks very much.
Amy Hood
Thanks Brad.

Welcome to the Third Quarter 2014 Microsoft Corporation Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would like to turn the call over to Chris Suh, General Manager of Investor Relations. Chris, please proceed.
Chris Suh - General Manager, Investor Relations
Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me today are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel.
On our website, microsoft.com/investor, we have posted a document summarizing our quarterly results, as well as a slide deck, which is intended to follow the quarterly results document and provide a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Please keep in mind that all growth comparisons relate to the corresponding period of last year. Unless otherwise specified, all impacted numbers have been adjusted for the cumulative effect of last year’s revenue deferrals and recognition related to the Windows Upgrade Offer, the Office Deferral, the Video Game Deferral, and the expense related to the non-tax deductible European Commission Fine. As a reminder, in our segment reporting structure, we have consolidated revenue adjustments of this nature into Corporate and Other to provide better comparability of operating results.
We will post this call’s prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today’s call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript at the Microsoft Investor Relations website until April 24, 2015.
During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today’s earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
And with that, I will turn the call over to Satya.
Satya Nadella - Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Chris. It’s great to have the opportunity to join today’s call. From my first day, I have said I am committed to an ongoing dialogue with investors. Joining these investor calls going forward is going to be a big part of that, and I am enthusiastic about today’s call. It’s been an incredibly busy couple of months. In addition to executing on our plan and announcing new products and services, I have spent a lot of time gathering feedback and exchanging ideas with customers, partners, employees and investors. It is important and valuable to see the company with a fresh perspective to get grounded both our current realities and future opportunities.
As I have told our employees, our industry does not respect tradition, it only respects innovation. This applies to us and everyone else. When I think about our industry over the next 5, 10 years, I see a world where computing is more ubiquitous and all experiences are powered by ambient intelligence. Silicon, hardware systems and software will co-evolve together and give birth to a variety of new form factors. Nearly everything we do will become more digitized, our interactions with other people, with machines and between machines. The ability to reason over and draw insights from everything that’s been digitized will improve the fidelity of our daily experiences and interactions. This is the mobile-first and cloud-first world. It’s a rich canvas for innovation and a great growth opportunity for Microsoft across all our customer segments.
To thrive in this world, we will continue to zero in on the things customers really value and Microsoft can uniquely deliver. We want to build products that people love to use. And as a result, you will see us increasingly focus on usage as the leading indicator of long-term success. To that end, we are already making progress.
Amy will provide additional detail, but I wanted to say a few words about the quarter itself. Today’s results demonstrate the breadth and strength of our overall business. We saw strong momentum in cloud services. Our commercial cloud business more than doubled year-over-year with Office 365 and Azure both performing extremely well. Business customers continue to make Windows their overwhelming platform of choice, with solid growth in both Windows Pro and Windows volume licensing revenues. We saw continued improvement in search, with our U.S. search share growing to 18.6% and search revenue increasing by 38%. Bing continues to deliver platform capabilities across our products. One recent example of this is the recently announced Cortana virtual assistant for Windows Phone. And very importantly, across all our businesses we continued to have a rigorous focus on execution and cost discipline, resulting in solid revenue and earnings per share.
I sum up this quarter in two words execution and transition. We delivered solid financial results and we took several steps to reorient Microsoft. In recent weeks, we talked about how we are advancing Office, Windows and our data platform and how we think holistically about the constituencies we serve IT, developers and people at the center in a mobile first cloud, first world. We will continue to invest in our cloud capabilities including Office 365 and Azure in the fast growing SaaS and cloud platform markets. We are committed to ensuring that our cloud services are available across all device platforms that people use. We are delivering a cloud for everyone on every device. At the same time, we have bold plans to move Windows forward. We are investing and innovating in every dimension from form-factor to software experiences to price. Windows platform is unique in how it brings together consistent end user experiences across small to large screens, broadest platform opportunity for developers and control and assurance for IT. And with the addition of Nokia’s talented people and their depth in mobile technologies we will enhance our device capabilities.
The past two and a half months have been a period of significant change at Microsoft, but also a period of nailing the basics and delivering against our product and financial plans. In the months ahead, we will continue to be intensely be focused on two things rock-solid execution and pivoting the company towards the future. We will continue to push hard and move quickly and you will see the proof of that month after month in the products and services we build for the mobile-first, cloud-first world. What you can expect of Microsoft is courage in the face of reality. We will approach our future with a challenger mindset. We will be bold in our innovation. We will be accountable to our customers, partners and shareholders.
And with that, I will turn it over to Amy to go further into the details of our quarter. And then we will be happy to take your questions after that.
Amy Hood - Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Satya and good afternoon everyone. Let me start with a few things I think are notable this quarter. Then, I will give our outlook before moving on to Q&A. We had a very good third quarter with solid results across our businesses and strong momentum in our most strategic areas. At the same time we remained focused and disciplined in our spending. Total revenue was $20.4 billion, up 8%, and earnings per share grew 5%. We had outstanding momentum and results in our cloud services. As Satya mentioned, Commercial Cloud revenue more than doubled again this quarter. Office 365 is now on an annual revenue run rate of $2.5 billion and Azure revenue grew over 150%, driven by both new customers and increased usage.
In our Office 365 Home service, we added nearly 1 million new users this quarter and now have over 4.4 million subscribers. We continued to enhance its value proposition with new features, premium services and cross platform functionality. As we cross the one year anniversary since launch, we are pleased with the renewal rates we are experiencing thus far. With Bing, we made clear progress again this quarter. We grew our U.S. share and improved RPS significantly. Display revenue related to portal and email declined, while we saw ad revenue growth in products like Skype and Xbox.
Importantly, we are innovating while expanding our cloud gross margins through both improved scale and continuous engineering efforts to drive efficiency. Businesses are clearly expressing their overwhelming preference for Windows. Windows Pro revenue grew 19% driven by growth in business PCs, mix shift to developed markets where attach is higher, continued strength in the enterprise, and an increased mix of Pro in small and medium businesses. Windows Volume Licensing also had a solid 11% revenue growth. Windows XP End of Support contributed in part to this growth we saw this quarter as did a general hardware refresh.
 
Our commercial results reflect ongoing strength and we again outperformed the enterprise IT market. Customer movement from transactional purchasing to subscriptions and multi-year agreements was better than our expectations. Therefore, our commercial unearned revenue grew 12% this quarter, which was above our expectations and our contracted not billed balance exceeded $22 billion. We had double-digit growth in SQL, System Center, Windows Server Premium and Lync. Clearly, our value proposition and product roadmap is resonating.
Xbox One has sold in over 5 million units since launch and engagement has been high with users spending nearly 5 hours per day on their console. We will continue to extend the unique entertainment value proposition of Xbox One, particularly in markets outside of the U.S. where some services aren’t as mature. Xbox 360 sales exceeded our expectations this quarter. And across the platform, Xbox Live members continued to embrace the service with transactional revenue growing 17%. We do expect to work through some inventory in Q4. We continue to enhance the value proposition of Surface through both hardware and software innovation, which makes Surface one of the best high value productivity devices available. This quarter, the mix of sales moved to our second generation and Pro devices. And this change had a positive impact on gross margin.
Now, let’s turn to operating expenses. As a result of our ongoing prioritization efforts, OpEx was favorable to what we expected in January. Across the company, we are focused on continually aligning our resources to our top priorities, which includes investing in the next wave of innovation for our customers. We are devoting resources to our sales team and partner ecosystems to ensure they are positioned for the migration to cloud services. And finally, our agility is also improving. As planned, marketing spend was redeployed from Q3 to Q4 in support of a commercial cloud campaign.
With that summary of Q3 results, I would like to talk about our outlook. Given the Nokia Devices and Services transaction is closing tomorrow, the guidance I will walk through next excludes any related impact. Let’s start with Devices and Consumer. In licensing, we expect revenue to be $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion. This range reflects an expectation that the benefits of XP End of Support will moderate. In hardware, we expect revenue to be $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion in what is a seasonally slower hardware quarter. This number also reflects channel inventory drawdown for Xbox consoles. In devices and consumer other, we expect revenue to be about $1.9 billion. We expect to see continued growth in Office 365 Home and Bing as we drive additional usage.
Moving on to commercial, we expect revenue across our two segments to be $13.1 billion to $13.3 billion. Within this, we expect commercial other revenue to be about $2.1 billion on the strength of the transition to our cloud. And in Corporate, we expect to defer revenue of about $100 million. We expect COGS to be $5.7 billion to $5.8 billion, with variability primarily due to hardware.
And moving on to operating expenses. For the fourth quarter, we expect OpEx to be $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion when adjusting for the prior year European Commission Fine. This represents full year operating expense growth of about 4%. This is on the low end of our original guidance that we provided a year ago of 4% to 6%, as we invested in R&D and sales efforts while rationalizing our marketing spend. As a reminder, other income and expense includes dividend and interest income offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging. We expect these items to generally offset each other.
We expect a higher tax rate in Q4 and the full year tax rate to be between 18% and 20%. We expect capital expenditure to be about $1.5 billion as we build out our cloud infrastructure. We are concentrating on hardware, software and datacenter optimization and supply chain efficiencies to maximize the benefits of our cloud scale. The benefits of this work are realized in improving gross margins. We expect unearned revenue to grow in line with normal seasonality.
Now, let me share some thoughts regarding Nokia Devices and Services. The acquisition will close tomorrow, which is about four months later than the deal economics we outlined in September assumed. Since then, the Nokia business results have also changed. We are focused on the transition from planning to implementation which accelerates with the deal closing tomorrow. Given this is a complex body of work that will take time we do not intend to update our financial guidance for any Nokia impacts during the quarter. However, I want to share the following to help as you update your models.
Under the existing commercial agreement between Microsoft and Nokia, license sales and platform payments are reported in the D&C Licensing segment. Once the acquisition closes, results for Nokia Devices and Services will be reported in the D&C Hardware segment. For Q4, we will clearly show the impact of the ending of the commercial agreement, Nokia’s ongoing operations and any one-time integration and severance costs. And we remain committed to achieving annual cost synergy targets of at least $600 million within 18 months of close.
Now, looking towards fiscal 15, Satya and I, along with the rest of the senior leadership team are working together to solidify our plans for the year ahead. Our goals are clear get more out of the tremendous resources we have available, drive innovation in products that people love to use and execute in areas where Microsoft can uniquely succeed in today’s mobile-first, cloud-first world.
And with that, let me turn it back over to Chris and we can move to Q&A.

Brent Thill - UBS
Good afternoon. Question for Satya, just if can reflect on your initial time as CEO and maybe give everyone a sense of how you prioritized your near-term objectives here in the next several quarters that would be helpful? Thank you.
Satya Nadella
Thank you, Brent. The first 10 weeks or so have been extremely energizing and as I have said for me what was important to us to reach out, talk to lots of different constituents and relearn the place and see it for the first time and just get a different fresh perspective even in spite of having spent 22 years here it’s been fascinating to get that fresh perspective. And the way I look at it is even from day one I have had this deep conviction that our vision is about being going boldly into this mobile-first, cloud-first world. And we feel that we are well on our way and if there is anything that I want to do is how do we make sure we would remain focused on it with every device launch, with every service launch we keep coming back and reinforcing that vision, because at the end of the day, it’s the purpose with which we approached the vision and the execution behind it which is what counts. And to me being able to think about that deeply what does it means for us culturally, what does it mean for us in terms of our plans. And then just getting behind it, leaning into it as an entire company is what’s my priority and that’s what I obsess about, that’s what I focus about.

Mark Moerdler - Sanford Bernstein
Thank you very much. Satya welcome on board and thanks for joining on the call. If you don’t mind I am going to ask an overall question either of Amy or of Satya. Looking at commercial license business, how much of the shrinkage year-over-year in commercial license is driven by the move of traditional license players from license or license paying customers from license to the cloud, how much is related to guys moving from software assurance, how much from license, can you give any color on that?
Amy Hood
Thanks Mark for that question. Why don’t I take that one, overall in commercial licensing I often talk as you know about the commercial business all up, mostly because I think some of the core dynamics really reinforce that we see a bit of what you are talking about, which is that renewal rates have remained high and in line. Our ability to recapture revenue in those contracts remains strong and our ability to attach cloud products has grown. And so what we see in this quarter and what you see even in the commercial licensing line itself is that continued switch. And in fact it was faster this quarter than we had thought. Really, when you look at our commercial on our revenue along with the C&B balance that we talked about last quarter, we have so many billings at the end of last quarter when you really normalized for those in the quarter billings, bookings were also better than we had expected in terms of the annuity stream. So, I think both a transition to long-term agreements is encouraging, the addition to premium product, the addition of new product as well as the transition to a cloud is really core to thinking about the health of the segment all up.
Mark Moerdler - Sanford Bernstein

Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley
Actually, thank you for taking my question guys. And Satya, again, thank you for joining the call, it’s great to have your views and inputs here. One of the questions I get most often from investors is trying to understand sort of how you are going to approach the role and what you are doing initially in terms of is there a strategic review that’s going on? Are you reviewing the businesses? And should we expect any big changes in the strategy of Microsoft? So I am going to pose that question to you, in terms of over the next couple of weeks, months, quarters, even is there anything of a strategic review going on? Is there any big changes in the Microsoft strategy that we should be expecting from that review?
Satya Nadella
Thanks Keith for the question. The framework I have in terms of how I am approaching my job and how we as a leadership team and as a company are going to execute and plan, because one of the things that I strongly believe in is you are planning on a continuous basis, you are executing on a continuous basis. It’s not episodic if you will. The only way we are going to succeed here is by having this notion that you are planning all the time and you are also making the changes to your plan based on the change circumstances. And I think that’s the way to run a company like ours in a marketplace that’s as dynamic as ours. But that said, I start with though a vision that’s very grounded on what the future opportunity is. So this mobile-first cloud-first thing is a pretty deep thing for us. When we say mobile-first, in fact what we mean by that is mobility first. We think about users and their experiences spanning a variety of devices. So it’s not about any one form factor that may have some share position today, but as we look to the future, what are the set of experiences across devices, some ours and some not ours that we can power through experiences that we can create uniquely. So that notion of having a central focus and the central purpose is what, I think we have already signaled and we are well on our way to execute on it.
Now you also need to continuously build some new capability. When you think about mobility first, that means you need to have really deep understanding of all the mobile scenarios for everything from how communications happen, how meetings occur. And those require us to build new capability. We will do some of this organically, some of it inorganically. A good example of this is what we have done with Nokia. So we will – obviously we are looking forward to that team joining us building on the capability and then execution, even in the last three weeks or so we have announced a bunch of things where we talked about this one cloud for everyone and every device. We talked about how our data platform is going to enable this data culture, which is in fact fundamentally changing how Microsoft itself works.
We always talked about what it means to think about Windows, especially with the launch of this universal Windows application model. How different it is now to think about Windows as one family, which was not true before, but now we have a very different way to think about it. And so we are well on our way to execute on it, but your core question of are we going to review, we are all of the timing reviewing. And one of the things that I feel as the leadership team we have really picked up the pace on asking the hard questions, what is the believability of any of our plans and pushing ourselves, because at the end of the day to me, I want to be very accountable to you all to our customers, to our partners as a team by executing on our plans very well, because at the end of the day that’s what matters. But so that at least gives you a framework for how we are approaching it.
Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley

Thank you. Next question, please operator.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rick Sherlund with Nomura. Please proceed with your question.
Rick Sherlund - Nomura
Thanks. First Satya on Platform-as-a-Service I am kind of curious how aggressively you plan to maybe change your business model to a subscription model and drive kind of like Adobe did, less upfront revenue, more encouraging subscription and cloud based and whether we should begin to anticipate what it might look like to Microsoft as you make this transition to more of a subscription business, I am just not sure what the margins are on your cloud business. And as you transition most SaaS companies have 70%, 80% gross margins, I am not real sure where you are on your cloud businesses today. Do we think this is going to be a smooth transition or might we expect it to be a little more disruptive as you gain more and more traction on a subscription in cloud basis?
Satya Nadella
Great Rick. Thanks for the question. I will start and maybe Amy you want to even add. The way I look at it Rick we are well on our way to making that transition, in terms of moving from pure licenses to long-term contracts and as well as subscription business model. So when you talked about Platform-as-a-Service if you look at our commercial cloud it’s made up of the platform itself which is Azure. We also have a SaaS business in Office 365. Now, one of the things that we want to make sure we look at is each of the constituent parts because the margin profile on each one of these things is going to different. The infrastructure elements right now in particular is going to have different economics versus some of the per-user applications in a SaaS mode have. It’s the blending of all of that that matters and the growth of that matters to us the most in this time where I think there is just a couple of us really playing in this market. I mean this is gold rush time in some sense of being able to capitalize on the opportunity. And when it comes to that we have some of the best, the broadest SaaS solution and the broadest platform solution and that combination of those assets doesn’t come often. So what we are very focused on is how do we make sure we get our customer aggressively into this, having them use our service, be successful with it. And then there will be a blended set of margins across even just our cloud. And what matters to me in the long run is the magnitude of profit we generate given a lot of categories are going to be merged as this transition happens. And we have to be able to actively participate in it and drive profit growth.
Amy Hood
And let me add a bit Rick. I think specifically as you think about the transitions and where you will see it. First, I would say year-over-year we had flat to improving gross margins in all segments but hardware, where we had a mix shift to the Xbox console, which from our business model perspective obviously drives gross margin decline. With that being said, within the Office 365 business, I will start from the fact and a principle which is having a user whether they be in the consumer or in the enterprise have access to our most recent, most innovative, most secure product which is always going to be for us probably the one born in the cloud will be a driver of satisfaction and a driver of usage. Those two things lead to revenue. You are already seeing that transition in the enterprise where we already sold that way. The transition is quite easy from an economic standpoint. In the transactional business you saw the impact of it this quarter. We had a bigger mix shift to annuity more went on the balance sheet. We still had strong growth, but you do see the impact inter-quarter. And in the consumer side of the business which you also referenced with Adobe, I think we have just launched another SKU in addition to Home called Personal as we continue to drive consumer usage that way. The launch of Office on the iPad is an example of where we will add the most value which is in the subscription.
Chris Suh
Thank you, Rick. Operator, next question please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs
Great. Thank you. And Satya I will echo everybody’s thoughts but it’s great to have you on the call and share your perspective. I was wondering if you could share with us the decision recently to offer Windows for free for sub 9-inch devices and how you think this impacts your share in that arena? And also how should we think about Windows pricing, given your comment about how Windows is going to kind of play in different market segmentations, how do we see Windows pricing evolving, if at all, for other types of form factors over time?
Satya Nadella
Overall, first of all, thanks Heather for the question. Overall, the way I want us to look at Windows going forward is what does it mean to have the broadest device family and ecosystem? Because at the end of the day it’s about the users and developer opportunity we create for the entirety of the family. That’s going to define the health of the ecosystem. So, to me, it matters that we approach the various segments that we now participate with Windows, because that’s what has happened. Fundamentally, we participated in the PC market. Now we are in a market that’s much bigger than the PC market. We continue to have healthy share, healthy pricing and in fact growth as we mentioned in the enterprise adoption of Windows.
And that’s we plan to in fact add more value, more management, more security, especially as things are changing in those segments. Given BYOD and software security issues, we want to be able to reinforce that core value, but then when it comes to new opportunities from wearables to internet of things, we want to be able to participate on all of this with our Windows offering, with our tools around it. And we want to be able to price by category. And that’s effectively what we did. We looked at what it makes – made sense for us to do on tablets and phones below 9 inches and we felt that the price there needed to be changed. We have monetization vehicles on the back end for those. And that’s how we are going to approach each one of these opportunities, because in a world of ubiquitous computing, we want Windows to be ubiquitous. That doesn’t mean its one price, one business model for all of that. And it’s actually a market expansion opportunity and that’s the way we are going to go execute on it.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs
Okay, thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
John DiFucci - JPMorgan
Great, thank you and welcome Satya. I am going to give Amy a question here for numbers. Amy, we see our sales and marketing expense declined 7% year-over-year in this quarter. Can you remind us if there is anything unique last year or is this just better controls? And along these same lines free cash flow, excluding acquisitions grew 2%, which is a bit of a surprise, given the direction the company is going and the first time in seven quarters we have actually seen growth in free cash flow. So, can you tell us how we should be thinking about this going forward?
Amy Hood
Thanks, John. I was getting lonely. I didn’t have any questions. So I appreciate it. Let me start with your first one, which was there any sort of unique thing that resulted in that comparable in sales and marketing. We didn’t have more a launch expense going on a year ago, but we also focused on rationalizing and focusing our marketing dollars in quarter. So I don’t – I think it’s a combination of both. And I would probably say more of the latter, which is really thinking and prioritizing more effectively throughout the year to earn the highest ROI on the dollars we are spending. We also did invest in sales year-over-year. So most of that is specifically around marketing, so I want to make sure that you understand that where we see opportunity, we are investing in our selling engine to get it, which is, I think an important caveat to make sure is clear when you see year-over-year sales and marketing decline. The second half of that, in terms of cash flow, I think as we remain focused on prioritizing and really thinking about the return on the dollars we spend, you did see also as I talked about earlier margins increase year-over-year. All of that had a positive impact on cash flow.
John DiFucci - JPMorgan
And going forward, should we – how should we be thinking about that, just continued discipline I guess around expenses, but also investment where it’s needed?
Amy Hood
Yes, I think when we talked at the end about how I think about ‘15 maybe it’s a better set of how we think about everyday, which is what can we do today, this week, this month to better invest behind places where we feel like we are uniquely capable of success and not being afraid to make those changes and finding the agility and the empowerment here to do those things is incredibly important. And I would say culturally Satya mentioned about being more data driven. I think in addition to the day-to-day, which was more focused on customers, I think really it’s a cultural statement about how we are going operate more internally as well. And so maybe that’s the most forward-looking comment I could tell you which is that being empowered to look weekly, monthly and see how we can get better and better and better. And I think that’s actually driven a lot of excitement around here.
John DiFucci - JPMorgan
Okay, great. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse
Hi. Thanks guys and congrats on a great quarter and Satya great to have you on the call as well. I wanted to focus in on Office 365 I mean if you compared this quarter to last quarter you added 1.1 million Home Premium users, last quarter I think it was 500,000. In September you talked about run rate of I think $1.5 billion, now you are $2.5 million. I wonder if you can just talk about the momentum that you are seeing in Office 365 and maybe give us your thoughts on sort of business versus the home/consumer side of that. And then Amy when you think about Office 365, how do you think about the difference in sort of lifetime value of an Office 365 customer versus a traditional Office user?
Satya Nadella
Let me start and then Amy you should definitely add on to it. Office 365 I am really, really excited about what’s happening there, which is to me this is the core engine that’s driving a lot of our cloud adoption and you see it in the numbers and Amy will talk more about the numbers. But one of the fundamental things its also doing is it’s actually a SaaS application and it’s also an architecture for enterprises. And one of the most salient things we announced when we talked about the cloud for everyone and every device and we talked about Office 365 having now iPad apps, we also launched something called the enterprise mobility suite which is perhaps one of the most strategic things during that day that we announced which was that we now have a consistent and deep platform for identity management which by the way gets bootstrapped every time Office 365 users sign up, device management and data protection, which is really what every enterprise customer needs in a mobile-first world, in a world where you have SaaS application adoption and you have BYOD or bring your own devices happening. So to me the Office 365 growth is in fact driving our enterprise infrastructure growth which is driving Azure growth and that cycle to me is most exciting. So that’s one of the reasons why I want to have to keep indexing on the usage of all of this and the growth numbers you see is a reflection of that.
Amy Hood
And Phil, specifically to some of your – how do we think about the lifetime value, maybe I will use the consumer actually SKUs which you started with as a good example. First, whenever we launch a new machine, a new SKU in this instance especially a subscription. I do think it takes some time both for the customer to understand the value proposition as well as the retailers and partners to really hone their motion, to pivot, to selling a new subscription model I think you are starting to see some of the acceleration as well as increasing awareness of the product which I think is terrific. And maybe more importantly as we think about the value we are adding the Office on the iPad announcement certainly brought attention as we continue to drive people to the subscription. And I made a comment around renewal rates and we are happy with them as we have just sort of passed the one year anniversary of the launch. And I think when you look at the LTV we will be better off for many reasons including financially. When a person moves to the subscription, my deep belief is the most important thing we will do is continue to think about how we can modernize, add features, add innovation so that it’s more valuable to them everyday they use it. And that is far easier in a cloud world than it is on premise. And so I think that’s probably the most important driver of LTV long-term.

Walter Pritchard - Citigroup
Hi, thanks. Amy, just a question for you. I know you’re not providing updated guidance for Nokia. I’m just wondering maybe a little bit of thought behind that decision, I know the deal closes tomorrow, you probably could easily move things around here a bit and reported on early next week and how that benefit? Is the lack of guidance there, is it just simply you haven’t been able to get your hands into that business at this point? Is there something else that changed in that business? Just trying to get a sense because it does sort of open up quite a bit of variability in terms of how people are going to model things over the next three months?
Amy Hood
Thanks, Walter. It really wasn’t a choice. The reality is we’ve not had the type of access on tool close where we could confidently begin to give the type of guidance that I believe we have come and you have come to expect from us in terms of the depth and analysis required to get there. They do report the different accounting system; it needs to be converted to GAAP. We’ve not had access to forward projection; I haven’t had a deep access to their system and so until we get that which really starts tomorrow. It’s not really a question of whether it was this week or next week, it’s really a question of us getting the confidence and access to be able to report at the level of details I know you all would expect me to do.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
Karl Keirstead - Deutsche Bank
Yes, hi thanks. I’d like to focus on that server product revenue number of 10% and Satya I think you know a thing or two about this group so perhaps I’ll direct that to you. But that growth rate is so far still above what a lot of your mega-cap tech vendors, peers I should say are posting. And I just wanted to ask you if you could try to outline for us the couple of factors that have enabled Microsoft to continue growing that server business well above your peers? And secondly if you think that kind of 10% ish growth is sustainable over fiscal 2015?
Satya Nadella
Thanks, Karl. So I’ll start in fact both Amy and I looked on that business. So we’ll both take a crack at it. It’s a pretty exciting change that’s happening, obviously it’s that part of the business is performing very well for a while now, but quite frankly it’s fundamentally changing. One of the questions I often get asked is hey how did Windows server and the hypervisor underneath it becomes so good so soon. You’ve been at it for a long time but there seems to have something fundamentally changed I mean we’ve grown a lot of share recently, the product is more capable than it ever was, the rate of change is different and for one reason alone which is we use it to run Azure. So the fact that we use our servers to run our cloud makes our servers more competitive for other people to build their own cloud.
So it’s the same trend that’s accelerating us on both sides. The other thing that’s happening is when we sell our server products they for most part are just not isolated anymore. They come with automatic cloud tiering. SQL server is a great example. We just launched a new version of SQL which is by far the best release of SQL in terms of its features like it’s exploitation of in-memory. It’s the first product in the database world that has in-memory for all the three workloads of databases, OLTP, data warehousing and BI. But more importantly it automatically gives you high availability which means a lot to every CIO and every enterprise deployment by actually tiering to the cloud.
So those kinds of feature innovation which is pretty boundary less for us is breakthrough work. It’s not something that somebody who has been a traditional competitor of ours can do if you’re not even a first class producer of a public cloud service. So I think that we’re in a very unique place. Our ability to deliver this hybrid value proposition and be in a position, where we not only run a cloud service at scale, but we also provide the infrastructure underneath it as the server products to others. That’s what’s driving the growth. The shape of that growth and so on will change over time, but I feel very, very bullish about our ability to continue this innovation.

Hi, good afternoon and it’s great to hear you Satya on the call. I had a question about the device and consumer licensing. First of all the Windows Pro revenue is very strong and Amy I know you had alluded to receding impact of XP upgrades, but I wanted to get a sense of how sustainable you think that growth can continue? And also noticing that the particularly Office Consumer revenue is improving on attach rates and there had been a bit of a disconnect there because of the transition to Office 365. Wanted to get your thoughts on how long that might be sustainable or whether this is related to sort of the broader XP expiration? Thank you.
Amy Hood
Thanks, Ed. Let me take those in reverse actually. On the Office Consumer performance I will always first and foremost think about the combination of Office 365 Home as well as our consumer performance. And that grew obviously at a higher rate than 15% that we talked about this quarter that and increasing attach. There were some dynamics this quarter that I think were important. Some stabilizing that we’ve seen in the consumer developed world PC market also benefits as you might imagine our Office business. We have the highest attach rates in developed markets and so that tends to be an important driver of Office revenue whether earned as a license or as a subscription.
The second thing is related a bit to your first question. These are – it’s sort of hard to separate oftentimes made the dynamics in our market. As we’ve seen Pro, Windows Pro mix increase, for example in small business, when people buy PCs with Windows Pro they’re more likely to purchase a form of Office whether it would be a subscription or a license. That’s another dynamic you saw this quarter. A final dynamic that I’ll talk about relating to Office was around Japan. We did see some pull-forward due to the tax increase and so that did have an impact on Office Consumer growth, but even without that as we talked about we still had increasing attach and very good performance for the quarter.
Now backing up because it’s complicated was the Windows sustainability and in the business segment. As we said it’s very hard to separate cleanly the impact of XP from what is an improving business PC refresh cycle as well as some positive macro-economic trends that we’re seeing. So as I said my comments – the end of XP does create a bit of a moderation in growth. That being said the differentiation and value proposition of Pro is clearer than it has been. The investment in that SKU and the value proposition of Pro has had mix increasing within segments of the market. For example in small business and in the enterprise for people who buy Windows PC. And so I think that’s an important dynamic that we’ll continue to invest in and we’re excited to say.
Ed Maguire - CLSA
Thank you.

Thanks, Ed. Next question please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Raimo Lenschow - Barclays
Thanks for taking my question. Question for Satya as we think about the new world in terms of more usage and more software driven rather than device driven. Can you talk a little bit how you want to reengage or further engage with the developer community with the big theme of your presentation at Build? I noticed (indiscernible) submarine was kind of mentioned by a lot of guys and saw a lot of attention. But talk a little bit about that, how the developer community is really important for you and what you’re doing around that to kind of get the software future of Microsoft going again?
Satya Nadella
Great. So thanks for the question. Developers are very, very important to us. If you’re in the platform business which we’re on both on the device side as well as on the cloud side, developers and their ability to create new value props and new applications on them is sort of likes itself. I would say couple of things. One is the announcements we made at Build on the device side is really our breakthrough worked for us which is we’re the only device platform today that has this notion of building universal apps with fantastic tooling around them. So that means you can target multiple of our devices and have common code across all of them. And this notion of having a Windows universal application help developers leverage them core asset, which is their core asset across this expanded opportunity is huge. There was this one user experience change that Terry Myerson talked about at Build, which expands the ability for anyone who puts up application in Windows Store to be now discovered across even the billion plus PC installed base. And so that’s I think a fantastic opportunity to developers and we are doing everything to make that opportunity clear and recruit developers to do more with Windows. And in that context, we will also support cross platforms. So this has been one of the things that we have done is the relationship with Unity. We have tooling that allows you to have this core library that’s portable. You can bring your code asset. In fact, we are the only client platform that has the abstractions available for the different languages and so on.
And then on the cloud side, in fact one of the most strategic APIs is the Office API. If you think about building an application for iOS, if you want single sign-on for any enterprise application, it’s the Azure AD single sign-on. That’s one of the things that we showed at Build, which is how to take advantage of list data in Sharepoint, contact information in Exchange, Azure active directory information for log-on. And those are the APIs that are very, very powerful APIs and unique to us. And they expand the opportunity for developers to reach into the enterprises. And then of course Azure is a full platform, which is very attractive to developers. So that gives you a flavor for how important developers are and what your opportunities are.

Chris Suh
Thanks Raimo. Operator, we have time for one more question please.
Operator
Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Ross MacMillan with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Ross MacMillan - Jefferies
Thanks very much for taking my question as well. Amy, I just wanted to go back to D&C licensing, because I think the guidance for the next quarter suggests a relatively modest decline at the midpoint, certainly more modest than we saw prior to this quarter for the last few quarters. And I guess I have two questions. One is, are you able to separate the XP End of Life impact from the broader improvement in corporate PC refresh, for example? And then two, Satya, what thought have you given around how you could potentially make what has been traditionally a unit model with Windows OEM revenue into something potentially more recurring in nature? Thank you.
Amy Hood
Thanks, Ross. Let me take the first part of that. I think our guidance for the D&C licensing segment takes into account a moderate decline as I said in the benefit of the end of XP as well as some of the impact of the pull forward in Office for Japan. So I think in general, it’s pretty reflective of the trend lines that we discussed. And I do think it is hard to really separate completely the difference between a general and the improving business PC environment and the end of XP. We tried our best to do that in the guidance and we will obviously learn more over the coming weeks.
Satya Nadella
And the thing I would add is this transition from one time let’s say licenses or device purchases to what is a recurring stream. You see that in a variety of different ways. You have back end subscriptions, in our case, there will be Office 365, there is advertising, there is the app store itself. So these are all things that attach to a device. And so we are definitely going to look to make sure that the value prop that we put together is going to be holistic in its nature and the monetization itself will be holistic and it will increase with the usage of the device across these services. And so that’s the approach we will take.
Amy Hood
Thanks, Ross.

Greetings, and welcome to the Microsoft second quarter fiscal year 2014 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions.] It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Chris Suh, General Manager of Investor Relations for Microsoft. Thank you, Chris. You may begin.
Chris Suh
Thank you, operator. On our website, microsoft.com/investor, is our financial summary slide deck, which is intended to follow our prepared remarks and provides a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.
As a reminder, we will post today's prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call, until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript at the Microsoft Investor Relations website until January 23, 2015.
During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.
Before I hand the call over to Amy, please keep in mind that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year. Also, unless specified otherwise, all impacted numbers for the current quarter have been adjusted for the cumulative effect of last year's revenue deferrals and recognition related Windows, Office, and Xbox video games.
As a reminder, with our new segment reporting structure, we have consolidated adjustments of this nature into “corporate and other” to provide better comparability of operating results. You can find details of the adjustments and a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in our financial summary slide deck.
And with that, I will turn it over to Amy.
Amy Hood
Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us today. As I look back on the quarter, I am pleased with the results, as we exceeded our expected revenue growth while continuing to maintain our focus on improved execution and cost management.
Our devices and consumer segment had a very good quarter and grew 13%, with a successful holiday. Our commercial segments had another great quarter, and grew 10%, to over $12 billion, as we continue to deliver on our differentiated cloud strategy.
We performed well this quarter, and you see it in our financial results. This holiday, we continued to make significant progress in the consumer space, headlined by Xbox One, which launched in 13 markets and sold in 3.9 million units in just over five weeks.
According to NPD Group figures, Xbox One was the leading console in the U.S. for the month of December, which was its first full month in market. When adding in Xbox 360, which held the third spot, Xbox led the U.S. market, with 46% share in December. We are excited by this enthusiastic response from our loyal customers, and are working to increase the availability of Xbox One.
With Surface, demand continued to grow, benefitting from improved execution at retail and favorable reviews of the new Surface devices. Sequentially, both units and revenue more than doubled this quarter, with customers recognizing Surface’s differentiated value proposition as one device for everything in their life. We feel good about the progress we have made over the past couple of quarters, and are enthusiastic about the overall opportunity ahead with Surface. 
The Windows ecosystem as a whole is also making important progress. Earlier this fall, we launched Windows 8.1, which enabled smarter, faster, and more personalized devices, and our OEM partners are taking advantage of this. 
Over the last few months, they’ve delivered a breadth of differentiated devices designed to meet a wide range of customer needs. We’re encouraged by what we’ve been able to accomplish with our partners and collectively, we will continue to focus on driving the Windows ecosystem forward.
Now, let me share some perspective on what we saw in the PC market, which was slightly better than our expectations. Business PCs grew again, for the third consecutive quarter, and benefited from an improving macro-environment, better availability of innovative new hardware, and a refresh cycle ahead of Windows XP end of support. 
Additionally, growth was higher in large enterprises than small and medium-sized businesses. Consumer PCs, while better than our expectations, continued to be soft, as they face challenges from competing form factors. And, as a general theme, developed markets outperformed emerging markets.
Windows continues to be the platform of choice for business. This quarter, Windows Pro revenue grew 12% and outpaced the underlying business PC market. This was driven by faster growth in both enterprises and developed markets, where Pro attach is higher. Windows non-Pro revenue, however, was down 20%, reflecting the dynamics of the consumer PC market. 
Now, let’s move to our commercial business, where key metrics remain strong. Bookings grew 12%, and renewal rates remained in line across our product portfolio, even with a large expiring base in the quarter. Unearned revenue grew 12%, and our contracted, not built balance is at a record level of over $23 billion.
To me, this is important, as these long term commitments demonstrate the confidence that customers have in our product roadmap, where we are investing in key areas such as big data, infrastructure management, and cloud computing.
In big data, our upcoming release of SQL Server 2014 builds on the momentum we established. Offering a complete business intelligence solution for big data, SQL Server is driving significant in-memory performance gains. Additionally, it enables hybrid cloud solutions with cloud backup and disaster recovery, as well as providing enhanced availability and security.
Hybrid infrastructure and management offerings also continue to be important priorities. Windows Server, Azure, and Systems Center are the centerpieces of our hybrid cloud strategy, and together they enable portability and scalability of workloads. Using our suite of products, customers get high scale virtualization, built-in software defined networking, and hybrid business continuity that enables their modern data centers.
As CIOs look to cloud computing to reduce costs and deliver business agility, they are turning to our cloud services. Office 365 and Dynamic CRM Online offer customers the ability to transition easily to the cloud and benefit from enterprise class features and a familiar user interface. Additionally, Windows Azure provides the scalability and flexibility that addresses their evolving infrastructure and platform needs. 
In summary, we had a very good quarter across our consumer and commercial business. We are taking share with many products, and seeing improvements in areas where needed to be better. As we do this, we continue to prioritize the deployment of our resources to areas that accelerate innovation and deliver products that our customers love.
With that overview of the quarter, I’ll hand it over to Chris to give more details about our performance before I come back and share thoughts on our outlook.
Chris Suh 
Thanks, Amy. First, I’m going to review our overall results, and then I’ll move on to the detail by reporting segment. We had a successful holiday quarter, and our broad, diversified portfolio helped us deliver record revenue in Q2. Total revenue was up 11% to $24.5 billion, and without the impact of foreign exchange, revenue would have been higher by $196 million, or 1 percentage point.
Cost of goods sold increased 46%. This increase was primarily due to costs associated with the new Xbox and Surface products, which launched this quarter, and also growth in [unintelligible] infrastructure supporting our consumer and commercial offerings. Even as we invest in our devices and services initiatives, gross margin was flat at $16.2 billion.
Operating expenses grew 3%, which was below our guidance, and we continue to focus on prioritizing spend for strategic growth initiatives. Operating income and earnings per share both declined 4% to $8 billion and $0.78 respectively. This quarter, we returned $4.3 billion of cash to shareholders in buybacks and dividends, our highest amount in the last 12 quarters. 
I’m now going to talk through the performance of each of our reporting segments. In our devices and consumer segment, revenue grew 13%. Within this, the licensing segment, which primarily includes Windows OEM, consumer Office, and Windows Phone, declined 6%, reflecting the overall PC and device market trends.
We continue to see similar dynamics to the previous quarter. Total Windows OEM revenue declined 3%. As Amy described, the 12% growth in Windows Pro was offset by 20% declines in Windows non-Pro. Excluding the impact of China, where we continue to draw down inventory levels, Windows non-Pro revenue declined 14%.
Office attach, including our cloud offerings, was up again this quarter. Traditional consumer Office licensing revenue declined 24%. However, we estimate that approximately 16 percentage points of this decline was due to the shift to Office 365 Home Premium. Excluding this impact, traditional consumer Office outperformed the underlying consumer PC market. 
Next, I’ll move to our hardware segment, where revenue grew $1.9 billion or 68%, driven by a good holiday quarter for our consumer devices. Xbox One had a record launch, and together with Xbox 360, we shipped 7.4 million consoles. For Surface, we saw improved sales of Surface RT and also introduced Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2 into the market.
Moving to the devices in consumer other segment, as a reminder, this segment includes our online marketplaces, advertising, Xbox Studios, Office 365 Home Premium, and other consumer products and services. Revenue in this segment declined 10% when compared to last year, when we launched Halo 4.
Search advertising revenue grew 34%, driven by continued revenue for search improvements and query volume growth. Bing has now grown its share of search queries to 18.2% in the U.S. Office 365 Home Premium adoption continues to be strong. With this service, customers are always running the most up to date version, have content available across their devices, with SkyDrive innovation, and get free Skype minutes. 
The overall value proposition is resonating well with customers and we now have more than 3.5 million subscribers. For the quarter, it accounted for more than 15% of total consumer Office licenses sold.
Turning now to our commercial segment, [unintelligible] commercial revenue and gross margin across both on premise and cloud services grew 10%. The commercial licensing segment, which reflects our traditional software licensing, grew 7%, and our commercial other segment, which captures our commercial cloud services as well as our enterprise services business, grew 28% to $1.8 billion.
As the economies of scale benefits accrue to these online services, we’re seeing gross margin expansion in our commercial other segment. We saw continuing strength across our commercial portfolio. Server product revenue grew 12%. 
In the data center, the premium version of Windows Server, which targets tier one application workloads, saw significant revenue growth again this quarter. Revenue for Systems Center grew double digits, and Hyper-V, our virtualization product, gained 5 points of share over the last year. 
In our data platform business, SQL Server continued to outpace the market, and revenue grew double digits, with SQL Server Premium revenue growing over 25%. Our commercial Office products also remained strong, growing 10%. 
Within this, our productivity server offering, SharePoint, Exchange, and Lync continue to perform well, with Lync growing over 25%. We’re excited about the unified communications opportunity, as we combine the enterprise richness of Lync and the global reach of Skype to transform the communications experience. 
We’re pleased with our momentum in cloud services. This quarter, revenue for commercial cloud services again grew over 100%, as customers of all sizes continue to leverage our cloud services to improve productivity, reduce costs, and leverage a secure and trusted platform.
We are seeing broad-based adoption, as Office 365 seats, Azure customers, and Dynamic CRM net seat adds all grew over 100%. We now have 70% of the Fortune 500 companies using at least one of our cloud services.
Having now reviewed our results for this past quarter, let me turn it over to Amy to discuss our forward-looking guidance.
Amy Hood 
Thanks, Chris. Before I get into our expectations for the quarter, let me quickly touch on Nokia. We continue to expect that the deal will close this quarter, but are still in the process of securing all regulatory approvals and meeting closing conditions. So all guidance provided here assumes no impact from Nokia. Assuming the deal closes this quarter, we will include Nokia in our guidance starting in the fourth quarter. 
Looking ahead to the third quarter, we are expecting a similar macro-environment to what we saw this quarter. As such, many of the dynamics from the second quarter will likely continue into the third. With that, let’s get into the outlook, starting with devices and consumer.
In licensing, we expect revenue to be $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion. This range reflects similar dynamics to what we saw in the second quarter, with business PCs growing, strong Pro mix, and headwinds in consumer PCs.
In hardware, we expect revenue to be $1.9 billion to $2 billion. This reflects continued post-launch momentum with Surface 2, Surface Pro 2, and Xbox One, with the upcoming launch of the Xbox exclusive game, Titanfall. 
And in devices and consumer other, we expect revenue to be about $1.8 billion.
Moving on to commercial, in what is a seasonally slower quarter, we are confident in our ability to continue to be the vendor of choice, with our productivity and infrastructure offerings. In commercial licensing, we expect revenue to be $10.4 billion to $10.6 billion. In commercial other, we expect revenue to be about $1.8 billion, reflecting continued momentum in our commercial cloud business.
We expect COGS to be $6.1 billion to $6.3 billion next quarter. This range primarily reflects variability associated with our hardware business. 
Moving on to operating expenses, we expect opex to grow 5% to 6%, to $7.7 billion to $7.8 billion. We are also reducing and narrowing the range for our full year guidance to $31.2 billion to $31.5 billion.
As a reminder, other income and expense includes dividend and interest income, offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging. We expect these items to generally offset one another. We still expect our full year tax rate to be between 18% and 20%.
We now expect full year capital expenditures to be about $6 billion, which is down about $500 million from our prior guidance. This reduction is primarily driven by improved capacity utilization and scale benefits, as we converge our online services infrastructure platforms while continuing to support the strong demand that we see in business.
Adjusting for prior year tech guarantees and product referrals, we expect unearned revenue to sequentially decline as it has in prior years. 
So, in summary, I feel good about the financial results this quarter. We are executing well across the company, as demonstrated by share gains in our commercial business, but we are also making important inroads with our consumer offerings. 
Looking ahead, there is a lot to be excited about, as we continue our transformation around One Microsoft. 
With that, I’ll turn it back to Chris and we’ll take your questions. 
Chris Suh 
Thanks, Amy. And with that, we’ll move on to Q&A. Operator, please go ahead and repeat your instructions. 
 
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from the line of John DiFucci with JP Morgan Chase.
John DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase
Obviously nice upside on the hardware business with Surface and Xbox. But my question is on the licensing business. So bear with me a little bit here. You had both licensing businesses, devices and consumer, and commercial licensing, they were both better than expected, at least by about $100 million each. 
At the same time, deferred revenue was shy by something like $250 million. But there’s some conflicting things, and I’m just trying to get my head around this. Contracted not billed, Amy, you pointed out was really strong. You saw a big jump, by somewhere around $2 billion sequentially. And you also saw some nice traction in the commercial cloud services. It more than doubled, assuming it’s small. 
So here’s my question. With all that happening, is there a shift happening with your on-premise corporate business to more transactional versus ratable contracts that would sort of help to offset the financial implications as you shift to cloud services on the corporate side? Is that what’s happening with all these movements?
Amy Hood 
I really appreciate the question, because it’s going to let me help expand on a couple of dynamics, which I think are at work here. So now I’m going to ask you to bear with me, with a little bit of a long answer.
Let me start by your comments, I think, around the overall commercial licensing bucket. I’m going to expand to include, as you did, the overall commercial business, both cloud and licensing. There are a number of metrics that I tend to look at together as opposed to individually, to think about how we did in the quarter.
You touched on one, unearned, which grew 12% this quarter, which is quite good. The second is bookings, which grew 12% in the quarter, which is very good. Renewal rates, which were in line across our products. And finally, the CNB balance, the contracted not billed balance, being up sequentially $2 billion, as you point out, is very big.
If you think about those together as a group, those data points are very important because together, I think you said a couple hundred short on unearned, with those data points together, I would say there’s no shortage in terms of commercial licensing and commercial other strength all up.
As you know, contracted but not billed tends to be at the end of the quarter. We’ve signed a bunch of contracts that we can’t bill for until the very beginning of the next. Think about that as business done in quarter. You’ll see that come into the unearned balance, frankly, in Q3, as well as into adjusted.
So that dynamic answers really the first question, and the part of the question you asked. That’s sort of a separate piece. Then you said, well, some of the dynamic could be explained by some strong transactional business in the quarter. 
And I would actually separate these things, because the first was good and the second was better than we thought. Office non-annuity, or transactional, did a little better than we thought in quarter as well, and so that’s a good point that we didn’t bring out, that that is another component of the 10% all up commercial growth.
Now, so, I guess my answer is, I agree with your transactional comment, but I disagree that it’s probably that it’s a component of a “shortfall in unearned.” I would say both are actually quite good. 
John DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase 
That’s fairly helpful, but just a clarification on the contracted not yet billed. And yes, contracts get signed at the end of the quarter. So you’re saying that the big jump primarily was because they just hadn’t been billed yet. I could see if you were just signing longer term deals, that you’re going to bill annually, but that’s not what’s happening? Either one could happen.
Amy Hood 
That’s right. If something was actually billed at the end of the quarter, it goes into unearned. Contracted but not billed is actually that the contract was signed, but that because the billing won’t quite take place until after the end of the fiscal quarter, it ends up in contracted but not billed as opposed to unearned.
John DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase
Typically, your contracts are three years, but are we seeing any extension on the average contract length?
Amy Hood 
No. That’s not one of the impacts.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Sanford C. Bernstein. 
Mark Moerdler - Sanford Bernstein 
Two quick questions. The first one is can you give us any sense of how much of the Office 365 and the Home Premium could be generated by net new users as compared to simply the move over of existing users?
Amy Hood 
Here’s how I think about the value proposition, because I can’t really say, these are sales through retail and [unintelligible] generally, whether it’s a net new user or not. What I can say is that attach overall went up in the Office consumer business, which I would say is, and could be, a sign that some of those are net new. And I would hope that to be the case. 
The value proposition of Office 365 Home Premium really does expand the footprint. It allows for multiple users, it has cross-platform capabilities with Office for Mac, it’s got mobile capabilities as well, and allows for easier trial. So it does sort of lower many of the barriers to experience and try the product. So while I can’t point and say there’s an exact number that is a new user, I can certainly say with attach going up, that dynamic is helpful. 
Mark Moerdler - Sanford Bernstein 
The second quick question is on the Windows side, we’ve seen obviously an improvement on the numbers on here. Do you believe that’s being driven purely by an improvement going on on the market, it’s the Windows 7 refresh accelerating as we get closer to the day? Any sense of what the drivers are, both on the consumer and the enterprise side as to why we’re seeing the pickup?
Amy Hood 
I covered it a little bit in my comments, but it’s probably worth spending a little bit more time. Let me start with the business market. I think there really are three factors that I would point to, particularly in the business environment. And the first one may also help on the consumer side. 
The overall macro spending environment is better. It’s a little better than we thought, and in businesses we’re seeing it, you’re seeing it in some of the IT spend forecasts you all put out. They’re being raised, and I think that has an impact.
The second is I think our partners have done a very good job expanding the types and availability of new and interesting hardware. That brings people to the store, and I think it’s an encouraging sign. And finally, as you asked, is the end of life of XP. That has been an impact, and we expect it to continue to be, as we said, in Q3. But I wouldn’t point to simply one of the factors as being the reason, but it is a combination of those factors.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.
Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse 
Just have a question back on that Windows volume licensing side. You kind of touched on it earlier, but you saw 10% growth year over year this quarter versus 6% last quarter. So you continue to have very healthy growth. One of the questions I’ve been getting from some clients is A) what’s driving that, and B) as we get closer and actually pass the official end of life of XP, how do you think that’s going to affect the growth in Windows licensing beyond that point?
Amy Hood 
I’m going to take the opportunity to make your question two questions. One, to just talk about Windows volume licensing overall, and secondly, allow me to talk a little bit about the places that you can see the impact of Windows XP in the current quarter. And I think that will help as you think about Q3 going forward.
In volume licensing, you’re right, it did grow 10% in Q2. And we do believe we are seeing some of the benefits of that growth is the end of life of Windows XP. But it’s also reflective of the value many of our bigger customers are seeing in upgrading to the enterprise version of Windows. The enterprise SKU includes things like Direct Access, Windows to Go, Corporate Image, App Blocker, and those really are differentiating. And they really do matter to many CIOs.
So I think specifically on VL, while end of life on XP is one component, it’s certainly not the only component. Now, if I expand your question to sort of - and I think in a way Mark asked about it too - is the end of life of XP. 
One place that we’ve talked about it was Windows, and how does it play into the business PC growth. The second we talked about was volume licensing. And the third was actually talked about in John’s question, with Office and some transactional strength.
Some of the strength that we saw in Office transactionally really can be linked back to the end of life of XP. As people refresh a PC, and if they’re buying Pro, those people often are Office customers, and so if they tend to buy on a transactional basis, we also see some impact through Office. I think you can tie that back to some of the outperformance we saw in the quarter as well. 
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs 
Amy, I wanted to ask if you could share with us how you see the gross margin profile of the company changing, as you continue with your journey to be a devices and services company. And as you look out to when the transition is complete, and I know you probably don’t know when exactly that’s going to occur, how do we think about what it will look like?
Amy Hood 
This is one of those questions that I think is best taken in a bit of a chunk. First of all, I think if you look at our commercial segment, I’ll do it all up, because I think it’s relatively easy with that breakdown. 
In general, and you saw it this quarter, even if we continue to invest in the infrastructure to support our cloud conversion of our commercial customers to Azure and Office 365 and CRM Online, our actual gross margin remains flat, which means we’re increasing our utilization and growing gross margin in the commercial cloud business as we continue to see traction.
Over time, I continue to believe our commercial business, in the absolute, moving to the cloud is a net positive, as I talked about before, to overall profit, including the increasing amount of gross margin we make as a company.
So, I think this quarter was 83%-ish, so that, I would take as a separate bucket from our devices and consumer business. And there, what’s interesting is we have a couple of business models there, with different gross margin profiles. And you’re actually seeing the impact of some of that in this quarter. 
Xbox, as we know, especially with new consoles like the One, tends to be gross margin negative on the front. This is a heavy quarter for that over time, for the attach. First, second, third party games and other services, the margin profile with any console [unintelligible] changes. But it’s never going to be an 83% gross margin. It’s just a different business, even for the market leader, and even successfully generating cash and returns. That is different from other businesses we also have in D&C. 
So I think the important thing that I tend to focus on as I go through all these businesses is continued margin improvement within the business, continued efficiency within the business, and continued focus on the absolute profit within each of those areas. And then the mix then becomes more of a math equation, as we continue to grow the overall amount of cash and profit the company generates.

Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS.
Brent Thill - UBS 
Just back on contracted not billed, you had four quarters of over $21 billion and then jumping up obviously north of $23 billion. That jump that happened, can you just help us understand the buckets that made that jump this quarter? Is there an easier way to think through where that actually came from?
Amy Hood 
Yes and no, of course. Let me say, contracted but not billed is related to the number of expirations we have in the quarter. Chris and I both talked about, we did have a lot of expirations in the quarter. When those tend to fall at the end, it can impact the actual magnitude, the actual number of expirations, and then the timing of when those fall in the quarter can also impact how it’s recognized. 
And that’s why I never really look at it separately from unearned, bookings, and renewals together. Because timing is one thing, that’s why I tend to put them in a bucket and say, together it’s a good and healthy trajectory.
Brent Thill - UBS 
And just real quick, on the multiyear agreements, you mentioned healthy renewals. Any color you can add to the re-up on the size of what you’re seeing in general across some of those bigger multiyear agreements?
Amy Hood 
I think in general it reflects the same trends we’ve been seeing across our broad portfolio. You see it across Windows, Office, and Server. If you look at our KPIs, I think that points out that it’s pretty broad based. So I don’t think there is any on particular area I would call out. It’s really more about platform health and commitment.

Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citigroup.
Walter Pritchard - Citigroup 
Question on the consumer retail side. This is the first year I think you’ve had a full retail store presence. You also, I believe, had some presence in some of the Best Buys with sort of mini stores in there. And I’m wondering what your takeaway is from the holiday season, and if those efforts you think were part of the reason why you had a pretty successful season, especially on the PC side, and what that experience suggests that you should do in future in terms of retail store buildout and general investment around retail.
Amy Hood 
When we talk about improved retail execution, I really think that’s a partnership, as you said, with retailers, with our OEMs, and with our efforts to really improve both the devices, the assortment, and the experience of buying in the PC aisle. So I do feel good about the investments we’ve made there, and we’ve made them, I think, thoughtfully, and continue to keep a focus on cost and expense as we do that. So do I think it had an impact? I do. But I really think the broader impact was investments and commitments we had with our partners to also improve the retail buying experience.

Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.
Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley 
I wanted to dig into gross margins in the quarter, because by my estimates, you guys outperformed guidance for gross margin that you gave in the quarter, despite the fact that you saw significant outperformance in D&C hardware, which, as you were saying, especially for something like Xbox One, which is just out of the gate, you had expectations of being very low, if not negative gross margins. Can you help us understand a little bit of where that gross margin outperformance came from? Was any of it in D&C hardware, getting better yields, better gross margins, on those products, and your expectations? And if not, where did the outperformance come from?
Amy Hood 
I’m glad you asked that question. With our outperformance, as you pointed out in D&C hardware, we did actually see increased COGS related to that. However, that was offset by some COGS improvements and savings we saw across other areas, as we continue to focus on efficiency and execution. And so you’re right, we did see COGS grow with hardware, but we were able to find savings elsewhere as we focused on improved execution.

Our next question comes from the line of Rick Sherlund with Nomura Securities. 
Rick Sherlund - Nomura Securities
Congratulations on the margins, cost management, and execution, and also Amy, I think we all appreciate your very substantive answers to the questions. Just a follow up to an earlier question on the contracted but unbilled. We’re seeing VMware that they had a surge of three-year contracts coming out of the recession, and a lot of those are coming back for renewal now. Is that what you were suggesting, is you’ve got an unusually large volume of contracts coming up for renewal?
Amy Hood 
Yes. In many ways, you’ve seen this over covering our company for a while. Expirations can be chunkier. That’s not a year statement. This quarter we had a big expiry base. I wouldn’t characterize it as abnormally large, but the timing is a bit related to three years ago, and the timing of some of the contracts. So it’s probably a consistent driver.
Rick Sherlund - Nomura Securities 

And last quarter we talked a bit about are there any metrics you can help us to understand better what the effect of your revenues is from the shift to the cloud. I think on Office, it’s more of a net delta that I think you said it hurts you about $150 million in the previous quarter. Is there any way you can give us a sense for what the net impact is on the business from the shift to the cloud?
Chris Suh 
I talked about this a little bit. The place where you can see the most direct impact is in the consumer Office business. We talked about the business, on a traditional license basis, being down 24 points. But our estimate is approximately 16 points of that decline is accounted for by the shift to Office 365 Home Premium. So that gives you sort of a good estimation of the direct impact we’re seeing, particularly on the consumer side.
Rick Sherlund - Nomura Securities 
That implies it would only be down about 8%, were it not for the shift to the cloud?
Chris Suh 
That’s one way to look at it, yeah. The net number would be about 8%.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Ed Maguire with CLSA.
Ed Maguire - CLSA 
I wanted to ask about phone, because you had not discussed Windows Phone on the call so far. Just how it’s tracking based on your expectations, whether you are planning to continue to invest with non-Nokia OEMs? And also, whether any of your expectations or investment plans for the integration with Nokia have changed in any meaningful way since you announced the deal?
Amy Hood 
It’s a good point. We didn’t have a chance to discuss the phone results. We did see growth in Windows Phone, both in the licensing and in the mobile phone IP revenues. Both grew this quarter. 
And we continue to see the growth in many of the places we’ve seen historically, so unsubsidized markets, as well as with entry level smartphone devices. So I think many of those dynamics haven’t really changed.
Do I have any updates to how to think about Nokia? Other than we continue to expect it to close in the quarter, I don’t. We mostly remain focused on working hard to get to the point where we’re working together as one team to drive that business forward.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.
Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch 
I appreciate the fact that you’re trying to improve the margins in each of the commercial and consumer businesses, but the margin differential between these two businesses still is a pretty wide one. It looks like the consumer business is growing. The three dynamics I can see are, the margin differential is too wide. You’ve tried to improve that, the margin is still wide. The consumer business trend-wise is growing faster than commercial. And third is that you have this shift to the cloud.
So unless you do something like an Adobe or Autodesk, where you force the transition to happen very quickly, there’s the risk that you get a lot of growth, which is fantastic, and there’s a lot of progress to share, but the margin inflection point could be delayed for several years. I think that was one of the questions that was spurred behind, presumably, Heather’s question. That’s what I’m trying to get at.
So how long are you going to get this shift to results in a way that we may not see the earnings growth rate, but we may have to wait until some point in time? Or are you at the point where you can actually force the shift to happen much quicker?
Amy Hood 
The way I think about it is we have a broad portfolio, and we address customers of all types, and in many ways, our biggest goal is to meet the needs of our customers, whether they be CIOs or consumers. And setting our business model to support the products and the adoption curve that we want needs to be married with the adoption curve and timing of our customers.
I feel like we’ve done a very good job of balancing the pace of that. I’ve been encouraged by the pace of adoption of many of our cloud services. You heard premium numbers today, as well as talking about the commercial cloud. And so for me, it’s hard to say, is there too big of a delta. It’s really about managing each of these things toward absolute growth and absolute improvement, and having customer adoption. So I probably just have a different perspective on that than you have.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with Jefferies. 
Ross MacMillan - Jefferies
Amy, you said that Office 365 Home Premium was more than 15% of total consumer Office licenses sold. And I wonder, if you think about your commercial business, and we either think about it as a percentage of total Office 365 or as a percentage of maybe what’s traditionally been transactional, whether you have a similar metric in terms of percentage of total Office licenses sold.
Amy Hood 
That’s a good question. You know, we only recently started selling the Office client in our volume licensing agreement through a subscription. So that is actually good feedback for us to think going forward about talking about the Office specific business that way. Because in general we think of Office 365 as being a broad set of assets, including Exchange, SharePoint, Lync, and Office in the commercial business, and we haven’t really talked about it, given the newness of the model and the enterprise as being as meaningful as it has been in the consumer. The shift is far faster there, on the client.
Ross MacMillan - Jefferies
Yeah, I just think that would be helpful, especially if you think about it with respect to your traditional commercial transactional business. Maybe if I could slip in one other one, just to go back on the contracted not billed. I just want to be clear in my own mind, because I’ve heard two things. One thing I heard you say was we had stronger transactional business late in the quarter, but I also heard you say that there were frankly more renewals on multiyear that would have resulted in that balance going up, especially if those were late in the quarter. So am I right to think it’s those two factors that are at play here, both stronger transactional and a larger pool, if you will, of multiyear renewals? And is it relatively evenly balanced between the two?
Amy Hood 
Actually, transactional execution in the quarter is recognized all in quarter. That’s not annuity. It doesn’t go to either the unearned balance or the contracted not billed balance. So that’s not an impact that results in a change to the unearned or CNB. The latter, which is the absolute size of the expiration base, frankly could or couldn’t impact CNB. It can impact things like unearned growth, but it also can impact CNB, depending on if it is contracted in quarter, but not billed until after the end of the quarter.

Our next question comes from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel.
Brad Reback - Stifel Nicolaus 
Amy, in the Q it talks about the Surface still losing money, even at the almost $900 million run rate of revenue in the quarter. Can you give us any sense of what kind of volume you need for that business to have the scale to make some money?
Amy Hood 
You know, when we launched Surface just a year ago, our goal was really to create a product that showcased what can happen when you innovate in hardware, in the service, and in the software. And as you know, we’ve learned a lot over the course of this journey. And we have to make more meaningful progress. 
But I think for us we’ve remained focused, as we launch the second version of Surface, to stay focused on both price points and gross margin, and I think we’ve made a big leap from v1 to v2, and I’m looking forward to making leaps as we go forward in our product roadmap. But I do think it’s more to think about it as a goal we absolutely have, as we continue to innovate the line.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company.
Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Company 
Amy, despite the healthy gross margins, your Xbox platform revenue grew $1.2 billion year over year, but your related cost of goods sold went up by $1.6 billion. And I realize there may be additional costs related to launch, but just wondering if you could talk to expected profitability levels for Xbox for the balance of fiscal ’14.
Amy Hood 
We’ll continue to be in launch mode for Xbox One, especially many people are excited about the launch of Titanfall in March, and we’ll continue to add and expand markets over the course of the year. So I would continue to think about our investment in being the leading next-generation console as certainly extending.

And our last question comes from Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities.
Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities 
Amy, you mentioned briefly in your comments some of the strength you’d seen in SQL Server, and that seems to be taking market share. You highlighted a couple of the features, but what do you think is driving that market share gain? And a similar question over on the server side, where you seem to have better server numbers than what we’ve seen in units? And what would be accounting for that additional strength?
Amy Hood 
You’re right, I only pointed out a few of the value propositions of SQL Server. And actually, dating back years, the real value proposition of SQL has been the breadth of its offerings: analytics, reporting, and core database functionality. And so over the years, I think the balance of those things, and continuing to add and innovate at very good value, has continued to be appealing.
And as we move forward and add some cloud capabilities to our hybrid model, and continue to add features into the premium levels, when you’re the established, and I think in many ways unit leader, then you can focus on continuing to move up the stack, adding value, and increasing your premium mix. And the team has really done a terrific job of doing that, so it’s nice to be asked, so that I can talk about it.
And I mentioned it briefly, Systems Center is another where we’ve gained share in virtualization, and I think we’re quite proud of the progress we’ve made, especially in that area, and that’s enabled a lot of growth as well. So I actually appreciate the question. It’s good to be able to talk so positively about those assets.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
Before I hand the call over to Amy, I would like to remind you that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year. Also, please keep in mind that with our new segment reporting structure, adjustments for items such as upgrade offers, tech guarantees and presales are consolidated into corporate other to provide a comparison of operating results.
Unless specified otherwise, all impacted numbers for the current quarter have been adjusted for the cumulative effect of last year's revenue deferral related to the Windows upgrade offer, Windows 8 presale, the Office offer and a $113 million revenue deferral in the current quarter, primarily related to Windows 8.1 presale. You can find details of adjustments and reconciliations of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in our financial summary slide deck.
With that I will turn it over to Amy.
Amy Hood
Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. By now you had a chance to look our press release, earning slide deck, key performance indicators and our 10-Q. Our results have been reported using the new reporting framework I first discussed in our financial analyst meeting in September.
Since this is a new way to think about our business, I am sure you will have a lot of questions, so after our prepared remarks, we will allow a little more time than usual for Q&A.
With that, let me dive right in.
This quarter, we delivered record first quarter revenue. We did it while working through a significant affirmation of our organization and while making significant move to implement our new strategy. Our company is focused and delivering. Our enterprise business remained strong despite a macro environment that some had characterized as tough. We are driving our business forward with industry-leading solutions in the areas like collaboration, unified communications and cloud services, and high customer satisfaction is driving high enterprise agreement renewal rate.
At the same time, we are making meaningful progress in our consumer business. We saw growing engagement and adoption across our major consumer services, including office 365 Home Premium, Skype, Bing and SkyDrive. With the new Windows, we are building high value experiences for our consumers that allow people to use our devices and services all day long whether at work or at home.
From a geographic perspective, we saw broad based revenue growth. Overall both, developed and emerging markets showed strengths. The U.S. and parts of Western Europe were particularly strong, while China was weak.
Now, let me share some quick thoughts on the PC market which turned out better than we had expected. We are seeing signs of stabilization in the business segment with two consecutive quarters of growth and a relatively stable outlook for the next couple of quarters. While the consumer segment is more volatile with increasing competition for share of wallet and also performed better than expected, particularly in developed markets.
With that backdrop, let's move onto Windows. We are seeing favorable reviews and customer enthusiasm for Windows 8.1, which became available last week. Windows 8.1 delivers on Microsoft promise of a quick innovation cadence launching less than one year after Windows 8. Based on extensive customer feedback, we added more customization capabilities, made the UI simpler and easier to use, added new and smart ways to search, improved power management and allowed multi-tasking, even on a tablet. Combined with the progress our OEM partners are making, we are collectively increasing the selection of compelling windows devices available to meet the dynamic needs of all segments of the market.
This holiday, we will see competitive opening price points on tablets and laptops, such as the Dell Inspiron 15 for less than $300. We will also see exciting mobile devices from six inch phones to 10 inch tablets, many with Microsoft Office. In the six inch category, we are incredibly excited by the Nokia Lumia 1520 tablet announced this past Tuesday. For eight inch tablets, Toshiba, Dell, Lenovo will have devices available for less than $300. And for 10 inch tablets, we of course like the Nokia Lumia 2520 with LTE.
In addition to third-party devices, we are also excited about our first-party lineup. With Surface, we are making progress with better end market executions. As a result, we more than doubled the number of units we sold over the prior quarter. In terms of mix, Surface RT did better than expected. With Surface Pro, we saw some customers delay purchase in anticipation of Surface Pro 2 which delivers significantly improved battery and processor performance.
Moving on to the enterprise, where demand for our solutions continues to be strong. Earlier this month, we announced our fall wave of enterprise products and services, which touches nearly every aspect of IT. We are seeing solid growth. We are outperforming our competitors and we are taking share in areas like virtualization and the data platform.
Our hybrid infrastructure and management offerings continue to be tough choices for CIOs with Windows Server Premium and System Center growing double digits again in this quarter. The latest versions of Windows Server, System Center and Windows Intune deliver enhancements in networking, storage and device management for Windows and alternative platforms. These enhancements will help customers realize the promise of hybrid cloud computing across their data centers, hosted clouds and Windows Azure.
In the data platform, SQL Server continues to outpace the market. The next version, SQL Server 2014, will offer new in-memory and cloud capabilities that will increase performance and unlock new hybrid scenarios. Later this month, we will make Windows Azure HDInsight, our Hadoop-based the Big Data solution generally available. We continue to bring additional value to the Windows Azure platform. This quarter, delivered a number of updates that enable faster connectivity, improve security and integrate access and identity across on-premise and cloud application. With all of the innovation we are delivering to our enterprise customers, we continue to be uniquely positioned to capture more and more of the addressable market.
Before handing it off to Chris, I would like to say a couple of additional things. As part of our new reporting framework, we have disclosed segment gross margin. The segment breakout is important in understanding our performance because each of our businesses are impacted by the different dynamics and have different margin profiles. In devices and consumer, the sequential change in gross margin dollars reflects the progress we are making towards our strategy of delivering a compelling family of devices and services.
While we feel good about the increased traction we saw with Surface this quarter, we know there is more to do. We are intensely focused on improving our capabilities in key areas like demand-planning and supply chain management and on achieving scale as quickly as possible. In commercial, we are already seeing the benefits of the investments we have made to transform our business model from perpetual software licensing to services.
In our commercial cloud business, which includes Office 365, Azure and other Microsoft services, we saw year-over-year gross margin expansion. With regards to our pending acquisition of substantially all of Nokia's devices and services business, we still expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of calendar 2014. We will provide an update to the EPS impact, if any, post-closing.
So in summary, we are executing better, getting our customers what they want and making meaningful progress through the early stages of our transformation. And we have accomplished all of this while also working through the One Microsoft realignment and several significant announcements. We are committed to executing and delivering and so far that's what we have done.
With that backdrop for the quarter, I will hand it over to Chris to give more details about our performance before I come back and share thoughts on the outlook.
Chris Suh
Thanks, Amy. First, I will review our overall results and then I will move on to the details by business segment.
Total revenue was up 7% to $18.6 billion and came in at about $700 million better than our expectations. Without the impact of foreign exchange, revenue would have been $200 million or one percentage point better.
Annuity revenue was particularly strong and grew 11%, driven by commercial performance. Cost of goods sold increased 23%, which was in line with our expectation of over 20% growth. This increase was primarily due to service cost and also higher depreciation related to the CapEx investments we made this quarter for cloud services strategy. As a result, gross margin grew 3% to $13.5 billion, reflecting the changing mix of our revenue.
All up, operating expenses grew 8%, which was generally in line with our expectations with the exception of G&A, which declined due to lower legal expenses. We continue to be thoughtful and diligent in how and where we focus our resources, in advertising, the [keynote], embraced One Microsoft and the benefits are already accruing with improved messaging and results.
In R&D, we are continuing to focus our resources while accelerating our cadence. Operating income and earnings per share, both declined 3% to $6.4 billion and $0.63, respectively.
Unearned revenue grew a healthy 14% to $20.1 billion and our contracted not billed balance grew to over $21 billion, driven by commercial strength. Our inventory balance sequentially increased by $675 million, mostly due to build the Xbox 360 and Xbox One. Ahead of holiday selling season, Xbox represents over half of our inventory balance.
Inventory for Surface products declined sequentially even as we built levels ahead of this week Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2 launches. This quarter, we announced a 22% increase in our quarterly dividend to 28% and also announced $40 billion share repurchase program. We returned $3.8 billion of cash to shareholders, our high quarterly amount since the second quarter of fiscal 2011.
I am now going to talk about the performance in each of our reporting segments. Our devices and consumer licensing segment is comprised principally of Windows OEM, consumer office and Windows Phone, including related patent licensing. Our Windows OEM business performed better than expected, declining 7% versus our expectation of a mid-teens decline.
As Amy noted, we believe we are seeing stabilization in business PCs, which grew again this quarter and drove Pro revenue growth of 6%. We also saw better than expected performance in the consumer part of our business.
Non-Pro revenue declined 22%, but with several points better than expected. Excluding the impact of China, which continues to have a different dynamics than other emerging markets, non-Pro revenue declined 17%.
Together with our OEM and retail partners, we brought an incredible breadth of Windows devices to market. We have also made meaningful improvements to our advertising campaigns which now clearly highlight the value proposition of our devices.
As we head into holiday, we are excited by the opportunities to bring the new Windows experience to even more users around the globe. Consumer Office licensing revenue declined this quarter. The financial impact of the shift to Office 365 Home Premium was generally in line with our expectations.
Office 365 subscribers benefit from the natural integration of services such as SkyDrive and Skype and have the flexibility to access the service from numerous end points. Whether via traditional licensing or subscription, customers continue to see the value in Office and overall attach of Office increased this quarter.
The Windows Phone ecosystem is seeing sustained growth. While we have work to do, our share is growing in many geographies, the device portfolio is expanding and the number of apps available in the marketplace is increasing.
about Ubuntu our devices and consumer hardware segment, where revenue grew $401 million, driven almost entirely by Surface. With improved sales and marketing effort, combined with pricing and promotional activities, we saw Surface units and revenue growth sequentially from Q4, with the mix of sale shifting towards 32 gigabyte RT device. Demand increased for this device both, in retail and in education. From a gross margin perspective, in addition to product costs, which grew as a result of increased Surface sale, we also incurred non-product expenses as we readied inventory line for the new Surface lineup in the holiday sales cycle.
Moving to devices and consumer other. As a reminder, this segment includes our online marketplaces, advertising, Xbox Studio, Office 365 Home Premium and other consumer products and services. This quarter revenue growth in this segment was driven by both an increase in advertising revenue and also volumes in our online marketplaces. Search advertising revenue grew 47% driven by continued revenue per search improvements and query volume growth. Bing has now grown its share of search queries in the U.S. to 18%. Gross margin declined slightly due to higher royalty costs and also infrastructure cost growth as we expanded geographic footprint of our services.
Turning now to our commercial business. With all up commercial revenue across both on-premise and cloud services grew 10% this quarter. Notably even as we invest for growth, we saw gross margin expansion in our commercial cloud business. Across our commercial portfolio, we saw healthy renewal, a continued shift to premium products and strong adoption of our cloud services. Our enterprise cloud strategy is resonating with customers and server product revenue grew 12%. SQL Server revenue grew double-digit with SQL Server Premium revenue growing over 30%. Our commercial
Office products also remained strong and grew 11%. Within this, SharePoint, Exchange and Lync collectively grew double-digits with Lync growing nearly 30%. Helping to drive this demand for our Server and Office product is deployment of hybrid cloud solution. This quarter, revenue for our commercial cloud services grew over 100% as services such as Office 365, our innovative Azure services for comprehensive cloud solution. Importantly, we are seeing strong customer adoption with Office 365 seats and Azure customers both growing triple-digits. Dynamics CRM Online is also expanding its base, with two-thirds of new Dynamics CRM customers opting for the cloud.
With that overview of our Commercial business, let me share the financial performance in each of our Commercial reported segments. Revenue in the Commercial Licensing segment grew 7% and in our Commercial Other segment, revenue grew 28% to $1.6 billion. As a reminder, Corporate and Other is where we consolidate adjustments for tech guarantees, pre-sales and the like. In the comparable quarter of last year, we had aggregate deferrals of $1.4 billion for Windows and Office and this quarter we deferred $113 million, primarily related to Windows 8.1 pre-sale.
Having now talked through our results for this past quarter, let me turn it over to Amy to discuss our forward looking guidance.

Thanks, Chris. As we look towards the second quarter, we are assuming the macro environment remains generally the same. With this, we expect many of the dynamics we saw in the first quarter to continue with strong performance in our commercial business and ongoing improvement in our consumer business. Importantly, we are set up for a terrific holiday season. We will have a wide variety of Windows-based devices in market.
Earlier this week, we launched Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2, and in November, we will launch our next generation console, Xbox One. Building on the performance and unique experiences that gamers love, it will also deliver an innovative entertainment experience by bringing movies, music, sports and live TV together in one place.
With that, let's get into the outlook. Starting with Devices and Consumer. In Licensing, we expect revenue to be $5.2 billion to $5.4 billion. This range reflects similar dynamics to what we saw in the first quarter. As I noted earlier, we expect the business PC market to be stable, however, the consumer PC market is subject to more volatility.
In Hardware, we expect revenue to grow 35% to 45% to $3.8 billion to $4.1 billion, reflecting the expanded Surface line up and the much anticipated Xbox One launch. The 10 percentage point range reflects variability in device unit volumes. In the consumer hardware business, such variability is not uncommon, especially during launches and the holiday season.
In Devices and Consumer Other, we expect revenue to be $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. Search revenue should continue to grow reflecting improved revenue per search and query volume. As a reminder, in Q2 of the prior year, we launched Halo 4, which contributed $380 million of revenue to this segment.
Now, moving onto Commercial. We expect revenue to grow 9% to 11%, in line with the first quarter. As we think about this part of the business, we are confident in our ability to continue to add value to our products while providing low total cost of ownership for our customers.
In Commercial Licensing, we expect revenue to be $10.7 billion to $10.9 billion, with similar dynamics to what we saw in the first quarter. This includes healthy renewals and strong annuity revenue growth from volume licensing with Software Assurance.
In Commercial Other, we expect revenue to be $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion, reflecting ongoing momentum in our commercial cloud business and enterprise services. As CIOs increasingly look to capitalize on the opportunities of cloud computing, we are confident they will continue to look to Microsoft for their IT solutions.
Moving on to cost of revenue, which we expect to be $7.9 billion to $8.3 billion next quarter. This range primarily relates to the unit variability assumed in hardware revenue. In Surface, we are still in the early stages of the lifecycle. As you know, there are many things that go into bringing hardware to market, including both variable and fixed costs. We are intensely focused on building volumes and achieving scale to cover these costs and get to profitability.
As you think about the economic model for Xbox, you should keep in mind that console margins are just one aspect of the overall platform's financial performance. Attach with games, accessories and Xbox LIVE services, also contribute to the economic model. We expect the launch of Xbox One to be the biggest in Xbox history and we feel great about our ability to continue our leadership position in the living room.
Moving onto operating expenses. We expect OpEx to grow 6% to 8%, to $8.5 billion to $8.6 billion. We also reaffirm our full-year guidance of $31.3 billion to $31.9 billion. We continue to invest in innovative experiences for our customers while remaining focused on expenses.
We still expect full year capital expenditures to be about $6.5 billion, even though we only spent $1.2 billion in the first quarter. Given the nature of the investments, there is variability from quarter-to-quarter due to our success based approach as well as the timing of delivery and completion.
We expect our tax rate for the full year to be between 18% and 20%, depending on our geographical mix of earnings. When adjusting for tech guarantees and product deferrals, we expect unearned revenue to be roughly in line with historical trends.
In summary, I am really pleased with our results this quarter. It was a great start to the fiscal year as we executed and delivered across all of our businesses. We are on track with implementing the transformation of the company around the One Microsoft strategy, and at the same time are not missing a beat in executing faster.
As we look forward to the second quarter, our enterprise business will remain strong and we are also set up for a fantastic holiday season with Surface, Xbox One and a host of devices from our partners, which will allow us to reach new customers and drive increased engagement.
With that, I will turn it to Chris and we will take your questions.
Chris Suh
Thanks, Amy. With that, we are going to move on to the Q&A. Operator, please go head and repeat your instructions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Brent Thill - UBS
Good afternoon. Amy, Chris, thanks for the additional details. I know everyone appreciates the forward looking details. My question is on the commercial revenue, obviously an impressive number in a seasonally soft Q1.
Your guidance assumes also a continued good trajectory. Maybe if you can walkthrough why you think you are outgrowing your peers and what has led to this double-digit number?
Amy Hood
Thanks, Brent, for that question. When I think about the commercial business and focus on our unearned revenue growth of 14%, plus our bookings growth, which was quite strong as well, 6%.
I think about the roadmap. The strength of the commitments the customers are making, is really forward-looking. It's a three-year commitment to the Microsoft platform both, to our cloud and on-prem solutions, the breadth and strength of that roadmap and our offerings, and in many ways that's what gives us the confidence that we are outperforming our peers. Also I it speaks a lot to the innovation in the roadmap we have shown, whether it's for Azure, Office 365 or our broader Server, what's the word, portfolio. I do feel quite good about both our competitive position and our ability to execute. I think we did a great job in the field this quarter, remaining focused on delivering what we needed to deliver to our customers and we were quite pleased.
Chris Suh
Thanks, Brent. Next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse
Hi, guys. Thanks, guys, and congrats on a great quarter. I just want to focus in on Xbox and Xbox platform. Amy, I wonder if you could give us maybe some color on how it performed this quarter, but in particular as you look into the December quarter here, obviously, you gave that gross margin guidance. But I was wondering if you could talk high level about how you are approaching the Xbox One launch play versus Xbox 360, from a perspective of how you are pricing it relative to COGS and just how the build of Xbox One looks versus 360?
Amy Hood
Thanks, Phil. I think it's a great question that gives me the opportunity to talk about the breadth of the portfolio that we will have to offer at holiday. And then talk a little bit about the gross margin profile and philosophy we have about those products. We are excited that we will have a great value offer at holiday with Xbox 360 and we will also have a great choice with our innovative Xbox One platform to really give us a good breadth rolling into holiday of selections across price points. We did, with Xbox One, make a decision to really enable a first-class experience out of the box. There's Kinect, there is a headset and there is the console. And depending on where you are around the globe, there may be a game included as part of bundled per geographic interest.
As I have said, the best way always, to think about the life value of the Xbox plan is over its lifecycle. I am excited about the increased opportunity that Xbox One allows us to attach more and different services beyond what we have historically thought of it as simply a gaming platform and when I think about the opportunity going forward, it is important in Q2 to realize that will impact our growth margin in the short-term but winning the platform at holiday and our positioning to do that allows us to grow profitability in a far different way over the lifecycle. So hopefully, that helps.
Chris Suh
Great, Phil. Thank you. Let's move on to the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with JPMorgan Chase. Thank you. Please proceed with your question.
John DiFucci - JPMorgan Chase
Thanks. Amy, billings were about what we modeled for the quarter but deferred revenue was about $700 million less than we expected anyway, which was equal to the upside in revenue. So I am just curious, did you end up recognizing a greater portion of revenue upfront this quarter than you normally would? Because like I have realized, given how you recognize revenue, I guess the question could be said, was the transactional portion of the revenue in the Commercial segment greater than it is typically this quarter?
Chris Suh
Hi, John. This is Chris. I am going to jump in a little bit and let me Amy add on. I think the way to think about, the way we think about it is, we did see growth across annuity and non-annuity in the business. But also the changing dynamic is the mix of the dollars that are going into unearned revenue. As we build more contracts in some of our subscription offerings, that also changes the nature of the term. If you think about one-year subscription offerings and things like this, that has a little bit of effect on unearned revenue balance as well.
Amy Hood
Let me add a little bit. I would have said, John, both of those things you said are true and both are good, which is I do think our unearned balance growing 14% year-over-year was better than we actually had expected, from our perspective. And we also saw very good non-annuity performance within the quarter, particularly in Office and in SQL which, I think, are very good signs, we believe, for both to see the strength broad based. As you know the annuity portion tends to be related to large customers making long-term commitments, some of the non annuity is exciting, but it tends to be smaller customers who have decided to go ahead and upgrade to the most recent version of Office, which is also encouraging.
Chris Suh
We will move to the next question please, operator.
Operator
Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
Ken Wong - Citigroup
Hi, guys. This is Ken Wong for Walter. I guess, we wanted to focus a bit on Windows, and the OEM business was down just 7% this quarter versus down 15% last quarter and what seemed like you guys had a lot of pressures on ASPs and what not. What drove sort of the quick turnaround from quarter-to-quarter? Maybe if you could just dig in a little bit there.
Amy Hood
Let me try to break it up a little bit, Ken, to make sure I understand and get a chance to talk about the overall performance. Business was better than we expected, so actually ASPs were probably higher than many people had modeled and than we had expected, due to mix Growing 6% in the Pro segment was both, better than we expected and probably better than many people had considered.
In the Consumer segment, the minus 22, taking out China to minus 17, I think is generally overall you take those two numbers probably in line with most of the device level estimates for PCs we have seen across the industry and from some of our peers reporting into system.
I do think, we were impacted by some inventory levels. It did come down a bit actually this quarter as well, so I think overall we do think that things were probably more stable in the business segment and encouraging and then consumer and developed markets particularly were better than we had seen.
Chris Suh
Thank you, Ken. Yes. Next question please. Thank you.
Operator
Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley
Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question. You saw a real market uptick in the advertising revenue, with the search advertising revenue. Any particular accounts you could point us to and sort of what really canalized that part of the business and how sustainable that's going to be on a go forward basis?
Amy Hood
Sure. Thanks, Keith. A couple of things. It was or going to - as you noted both by RPS improvements and volume improvements which is encouraging. I also think underlying matters some real technical improvements we made within the search engine, algos are better and the investments we are making are really allowing us to monetize at a higher level.
We also saw some strength in a few other geos, which helped increase the performance there, so I do believe that that trend we expect to continue into 2Q.
Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley
Excellent. Thank you, guys.
Chris Suh
Next question please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs
Hi. Great. Thank you, Amy and Chris. I just was wondering, you talked about the entry of a lot of new SKUs that are coming out for the holiday season. As we start thinking about building our OEM models, how do we think about for ASPs for this eight-inch and below category that you referenced there is a lot of product coming out with?
Amy Hood
Good question, Heather. Let me talk about first the importance of the breadth of the offers that we are putting into market. With Windows 8.1, one focus we had was to expand both, the opportunity for screen sizes and to reach new price points and to cover really from the smallest to the largest with touch and non-touch.
I think our ability to work with partners and some of the sales execution we have seen in the fields has led to have a broad opportunity at retail for holiday for devices. It is important. I do hope in some ways, this is a question that's a bit awkward. You always want to say ASP. It's good to have ASPs go up.
Transparently going forward as we make more progress, especially in the smaller screen sizes, we should expect units to go up and be very excited about that in terms of share, but ASPs would trend down. I don't think that will have a material - our guidance does not assume a material impact to ASPs in Q2, but over the long-term I actually do understand the question and would expect ASPs to be on that trend line assuming we are successful in those lower end device sizes.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs
Thank you very much.
Amy Hood
Thanks, Heather.
Chris Suh
Thank you. Next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.
Mark Moerdler - Sanford Bernstein
Thank you. And Amy, thank you, of course, for giving so much more data in guidance. We appreciate it. A couple of quick attached questions. You had said that the consumer Office last quarter was going to be down roughly 5% lower than the PCs due to the move to subscription. You said the attach was higher this quarter. Should we think that the dip was roughly in line with that?
Chris Suh
Yes. Hi, Mark. This is Chris. Let me try to clarify the numbers, just so we are all on the same page. So we did say consumer Office did decline this quarter. Last quarter, you were right, we said about 5 points of impact. So the impact indeed was about what we expected but with the increase in attach, they tended to offset each other in the end. So the numbers came in pretty much as expected. So I think that's the right way to think about it.
Mark Moerdler - Sanford Bernstein
Okay, perfect. That makes sense.
Amy Hood
Of course, I can't let Chris, I am going to add a little bit to the answer. Sorry. Mark, I do think it's important for us to continue to reiterate the importance of the success of the Office 365 Home Premium SKU from a strategic standpoint. We have done a very good job and I would say, as a mix percentage of the SKU, it continues to do even a little better than we had hoped in terms of execution at the endpoint and driving value. While that does have an impact on the initial ASP of the SKU, the long-term lifetime value of that product, in my belief, given the always up-to-date, first to see innovation, use across multi-endpoints, inclusion of Skype, inclusion of SkyDrive, really does allow for a higher lifetime value and ultimately a happy customer. So I really am encouraged by our progress and our execution there.
Mark Moerdler - Sanford Bernstein
Beautiful. One other quick question. Any sense for what Commercial Licensing would have been if not for the move to cloud and subscription? Does it make a material change yet at this point?
Chris Suh
No. The best way to think about that, Mark, is if you look at, it's not an exact offset, but when I talked about the Commercial business all up, I gave the construct around products like Commercial Office, Commercial Server as all up across both prem, on-prem and Commercial. So we talked about Office growing 11% across both Commercial Licensing and Commercial Other in aggregate. If you look at the specific segment, you will see that Office in the Commercial Licensing segment actually grew 6%. So you can see that we are having outsized growth in the Commercial Other segment which is Office 365. So that, maybe, helps at least dimensionalize the size of the growth in relative term.
Mark Moerdler - Sanford Bernstein
Perfect. I really appreciate it. Thank you, both.
Amy Hood
Welcome.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Rick Sherlund with Nomura Securities.
Rick Sherlund - Nomura Securities
Thanks. Just to follow-up on Mark's question. I believe there was a slide at SAM that showed about $150 million of negative impact in the quarter from the move to the cloud which, in and of itself, it's about 1% of revenue. So it's kind of not a very big deal. And I think most of that was from Office versus Server and Tools. So if you say it's about as expected, I guess I am just looking for some clarification here. Is the really only impact we are seeing in the Office segment versus Server and Tools or is there much impact in that part of the business from the move to subscription.
Amy Hood
Rick, let me clarify. The $150 million, you are right. It was actually just related to the consumer Office segment and had no broader connotation beyond that. So that $150 million in a quarter on consumer Office actually does have a meaningful impact to the gross of that especially versus PCs. So that being said, obviously, if we talked about the momentum in our broad Office 365 revenue, it is a bigger impact across not just Office, because I think that's actually not the way of thinking about Office 365 impact. There it's really around Exchange, Lync, SharePoint and the board Server impact there is actually more meaningful than its impact on maybe Office clients on the commercial side.
Chris Suh
Thanks, Rick. Next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Macmillan with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Ross Macmillan - Jefferies
Thanks a lot. I have two questions. Just first on the Device and Consumer Licensing business. Your forecast for Q2 suggest some moderating decline and I was curious as to whether on the corporate OEM side, if you will, that's just a reflection of the ongoing stabilization trend or do you also expect to see improvement on the consumer OEM side? Related to that, how do you think about the impact of the end of life of XP on the corporate OEM side? Do you think that the improvement is completely unrelated to that end of life forthcoming or do you think there could be some impact related to that? Thanks.
Amy Hood
Great. Let me divide that question. I think and you said two parts. Our Q2 guidance for devices and consumer licensing, really says that the trends we saw in Q1 on both sides continue in Q2, so I think that's an important distinction as you noted and asked for clarification on, so I hope that's helpful on that component. When it comes to end of life of XP, I tend to think about that more on the VL side as well and the strength there which will be in the commercial reporting segments.
We continue to make progress on the XP install base and now a little over 75% of the PCs are running 7, so I do think as we continue to get to end of life of XP, you will see the impact more on the VL side of the business than you would in the device and consumer licensing segment.
Ross Macmillan - Jefferies
Thank you very much. It's helpful. Maybe one quick follow-up? Just on the Office business overall in the Commercial segment. If you think about units, whether licensed or 365, when you just think of the aggregate pool of units, you sort of alluded to it before, but did that perform in line with your expectation or was it actually slightly better on a unit basis? Thank you.
Amy Hood
It was slightly better for Office, the best way of taking about that from a unit perspective.
Ross Macmillan - Jefferies
Thank you very much. Congratulations.
Chris Suh
Thanks, Ross. We will take next question please.
Operator
Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Maguire with CLSA. Please proceed with your question.
Ed Maguire - CLSA
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could address the conditions in China in a little bit more detail, not just on the consumer but also in the commercial as well as what your expectations might be given the lifting of the ban on game consoles for Xbox there, and also if you could just address what you are seeing in terms of your commercial cloud adoption outside of the U.S. Thank you.
Chris Suh
I will take the first part of the question, so yes as I said on the call, the macro conditions in China, which is I think consistent with what some of the other companies that reported as well have been challenging. Our total revenue across all of our business, including PC related businesses were down year-over-year and I think that's overall impacting our results in China all up.
I think the second part of your question was related to? Sorry, can you repeat your second question.
Ed Maguire - CLSA
Sure. Well, I was wondering about Xbox expectations there, but also the trends of commercial cloud adoption in areas outside of the U.S.
Amy Hood
We haven't really talked specifically about our expectations for China on the Xbox, but let me take the second half of that question. Our performance in both, Office 365 and Azure has actually been quite good both, in the U.S. to your question and outside the U.S.
Part of the reason that you have seen us investing on the capital expense side is to continue to build out the opportunity set, because we are seeing good demand outside the U.S. As you think our ability to be competitive there is just as high as it is here, so we have already seen that growth.
Ed Maguire - CLSA
Thank you.
Chris Suh
Great. Thanks, Ed. Next question please?

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo
Good afternoon. I wanted to drill a little bit into how you are thinking about holiday on the consumer hardware side and specifically just expectations around Surface, and then also any insight or color you think in terms of what your expectations are with RT versus Pro? Thank you.
Amy Hood
Thanks, Jason. I think, overall, for holiday, given our guidance, we clearly do expect a healthy holiday performance across the portfolio. I say that because we do have offerings that provide great value from having Surface V1 RT still in market, Surface 2, Surface 2 Pro plus Xbox 360 plus Xbox One really does provide both a value portfolio and those who want the latest and greatest experience have something covered.
The guidance does include good performance across all of those product lines. We did see, I think as Chris and I both talked about, a lot of progress in sales execution on Surface, in particular this quarter. And that does give us more confidence about our ability to execute again well in Q2. In particular, as you know, our RT did do quite well this quarter. And I look forward to seeing that continue with the Surface 2 device as well in holiday.
Chris Suh
Thank you, Jason. We will move to the next question, please.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi. Thank you very much for all the details as well. Maybe my math skills have gotten horribly weak, but I just took the mid-point, Amy, of your revenue guidance for the different line items and also the mid-point of your cost of revenue inputs and the midpoint of your OpEx and I comp with what looks to be about a 10% reduction to where, I think, most sell-side models or maybe I am hoping that I did something wrong here, but if that's the case, I get about 29% op margin relative to the 33% or so that you did last year. So can you just walk us through what are items that you are assuming in your cost structure which effectively makes the op income flat, although you are getting good revenue growth rate. I just wonder if there were any one time items or if it's just emblematic of a shift in your business model devices and consumer, especially with Nokia going forward? Wonder if we should not be thinking about op margins but really op income growth rate? Thank you.
Amy Hood
Thanks, Kash. I think the one thing I would urge you to do, as you think about the guidance we gave, is looking specifically at the D&C Hardware guidance as well as making sure you are mapping the COGS very specifically to whatever assumption you are making in D&C Hardware, given the business model of Xbox that can and will have an impact in Q2 to the overall gross margin structure. So as you think through that, I think that's probably one of the assumptions that it may sound like using the midpoint could lead you a bit off, off of where I would have expected.
Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. Thank you very much.
Amy Hood

Raimo Lenschow - Barclays
Thank you. I just wanted to follow-on from Jason's question earlier on. Can you talk a little bit about where you see the improved success and the sales execution success on the Surface? Is it kind of Commercial? Is it Consumer? And what's driving the improvement there? And how much is the improved revenue run rate, also driven by the fact that the channel needed to be ready for the holiday season? Thank you.
Chris Suh
Hi, Raimo. Thanks for the question. As we talked about, especially for this last quarter, Surface, we saw two things I will mention which is popularity of the Surface 32 gigabyte RT device. That one was more successful this last quarter. And we actually saw demand increase in both commercial and in the education customer segment as well. So we did see some improvement across both of those segment.
Amy Hood
Yes, I would say that another way is that, it was in retail and in education was where our RT performance.
Chris Suh
Yes, sorry. I meant actually -
Amy Hood
So I just want to make sure that was clear. It really was better execution at retail and in edu and I still look forward to building a commercial channel which we are just starting to do as we continue to add resellers to our model.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities
Thanks so much because I had two quick ones. One was, the SQL Server success continues to be very impressive particularly relative to the field. So I am wondering where you are seeing the most success there? Is that market share gains? Is that pricing getting into some new markets? If you could provide any color there that would be helpful? Then when is your expectation for the next update on OEM?
Amy Hood
Great. Let me take the second one first because it's the easiest. We still do expect transaction to close in the first calendar quarter of 2014, and post closing if there are any EPS impact changes to what we said before we will give them post-closing, so now back to your original question on SQL. That's a terrific one to get to talk about. Our growth there is as you said both, share growth and revenue growth.
It happens, I think, generally both, in BI which we have seen a lot of traction with. I don't know if you have had a chance to see some of our Power View announcements recently. Our ability to sort of span from the end user to the hardest Big Data problems really has resonated both, in the market and with industry analysts who has taken a strong position that we are the real market leader there.
The other thing I would say is, a very healthy performance of our premium SKUs. Our premium SKUs have continued to provide market growth and I think are competing quite well with the competition.
Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Company
Thank you very much and good afternoon, guys. Just two questions. First, Amy, if I recall correctly, I believe last quarter you had mentioned an expectation for double-digit annuity growth in fiscal '14. Is that still how you are thinking about the annuity part of the business?
Secondly, the year-over-year cloud revenue growth you reported was certainly impressive, but I was wondering if you could shed some light perhaps on how much of Azure billings or revenue are incremental versus [ballistic]?
Amy Hood
Too good question, I do expect our annuity growth and the guidance we gave it still does assume double-digit annuity growth going forward, and I think our performance this quarter gives me confidence that the guidance in Q2 is the right one given our strengths and our competitive position.
Secondly, on cloud revenue, your question gives me an opportunity to talk about the importance of our hybrid cloud. Within especially our server business, our ability to power the cloud whether you want to run it, you want a service provider to run it or you want to use ours, is really an incredibly powerful story and I think in some ways whether or not cannibalizing becomes somewhat difficult.
What we generally found right now is that it has been often additive, if you look at our server growth all up which we try to provide to help give some parameters around that, to give us some confidence that we are both, growing the base and providing additive opportunity. I think that's the number I would probably look to, to see the impact there.
Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Company
Great. Thanks very much.
Amy Hood
Thank you.
Chris Suh
Operator, I think, we are down to our last question.
Operator
Certainly. Our last question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.
Kirk Materne - Evercore
Thanks for fitting me in. I guess, two quick ones for you, Amy, on the commercial cloud offerings. I guess, first, around Office 365, you mentioned you have seen pretty good uptake even outside the U.S. I was interested in just your ability to monetize Office 365 in some of the emerging markets that have been challenging over time for Office.
Then secondly, as a follow-up to Gregg's question on server, within Azure, how much of the uptick in Azure is coming from sort of existing Microsoft logos versus bringing on net new logos onto the platform? Thanks.
Amy Hood
Great. Thanks, Kirk. Two things, I do think it's interesting. Maybe the best example of how to think about us moving beyond our traditional markets is the fact that we were the first to commence a data center in China, a market that we have historically had challenges monetizing at a high level. We went there, we are going there with Office 365 and Azure, we look forward to being able to make progress, we are investing both, headcount and capital dollars, because we do believe this provides interesting opportunity for us to begin monetizing end markets that have been harder for us to grow, maybe with our more traditional business model.
Secondly with Azure, I think we have seen both, but the thing I would say is what has been really helpful is that as we make it easier to attach Azure services to our normal rhythm in the field for enterprise agreements and through licensing. It provides a really helpful way and a really easy selling motion to provide customers flexibility. We added in the normal rhythm of the sales motion. We allow people to try, use and buy. And that has served us well in terms of being able to expose Azure to more and more customers in a normal selling cycle. So I think that's probably one of the better ways. It's the same actual selling rhythm we have used with Office 365 so successfully.
And with that, I wanted to say thank you. I know that this quarter, we changed reporting segments and that requires a lot of work. So thank you for all the work put in to understand our transition that we are trying to make as a company. So I am going to turn it back to Chris to say his final words.

Welcome to Microsoft's Fiscal Year 2013 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today’s call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time.
And I would now like to turn the meeting over to Chris Suh, General Manager of Investor Relations. Chris, you may begin.
Chris Suh
Thank you, Operator. On our website microsoft.com/investor is our financial summary slide deck, which is intended to follow our prepared remarks and provides a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. As a reminder, we will post today's prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available.
Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript at the Microsoft Investor Relations website until July 18, 2014.
During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements that are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties.
Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the Risk Factor section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
Before I hand the call over to Amy, I’d like to remind you that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year. Also, unless specified otherwise, all impacted numbers for the current quarter have been adjusted for the cumulative effect of the revenue deferral and recognition related to the Office and Windows upgrade offers, the $900 million charge for inventory adjustments primarily related to the new Surface RT pricing we announced earlier this week and the goodwill impairment charge from last year. You can find the details of the adjustments and reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in our financial summary slide deck.
And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Amy.
Amy Hood
Thanks Chris and good afternoon everyone. Thanks for joining us today. In many ways, our fourth quarter results reflect the trends we saw developing throughout the fiscal year. The consumer x86 PC market declined as users continued to prioritize devices to touch and ability. At the same time we saw continued strength in our enterprise product and cloud solution and increased adoption of our consumer services.
This quarter our Windows business declined as the device market continued to evolve beyond the traditional PC. We are working to transition the business into this modern era of computing taking advantage of the new scenarios enabled our Windows 8. As we said before, given the complexity of the ecosystem this journey will take but we continue to make incremental progress.
In June, we released the public preview of Windows 8.1. It blends the desktop and modern experience. It has new features and improvements in areas such as personalization, search, built-in app and cloud connectivity. Windows 8.1 will be a free update to existing Windows 8 users and will be made available to OEMs in August, less than one year since launch.
To increase and improve retail distribution, we entered into a strategic partnership with BestBuy to create a Windows store in over 600 BestBuy locations. These store-within-a-store locations provide a large scale hands-on consumer experience that showcases Microsoft devices and services. The percentage (inaudible) devices available at retail continues to improve. The first 8x Windows tablet became available at retail a few weeks ago. It has legacy application compatibility, includes Microsoft Office and retails for less than $400. We expect additional compelling small screen devices to be available in the coming months.
Less than a year ago, we launched Surface RT and Surface Pro, each with a unique value proposition. Surface is one part of our journey to bring innovative, compelling Windows devices to market in a modern era of computing. (Inaudible) analyze our progress and fine-tune our action plan as needed.
Hear what we did this quarter. We reduced the price of Surface RT by $150 to $349 per device. As a result of this price change as well as inventory adjustments for related parts and accessories we recorded a $900 million charge to our income statement. While this resulted in a negative $0.07 impact on earnings, we believe this pricing adjustment will accelerate Surface RT adoption and position us better for long term success.
We also increased retail distribution in the quarter. Surface is now available in 29 markets and 10,000 retail locations. We expanded the availability of Surface to our business and institutional customers. Through our new channel expansion program, commercial customers are able to purchase Surface devices from authorized resellers in the U.S. Over the next few months we will authorize commercial distributors and resellers in more countries.
So in summary on Windows, we are working hard with our partners to gain share in the evolving and growing device markets. I want to be very clear, we know we have to do better and that's one reason we made a strategic and organizational changes we made last week. With over 1.5 billion Windows users around the world, a transition of this magnitude takes time. We are confident we are moving in the right direction.
Now on to our enterprise business which continues to be strong. We closed out the year with record on our revenue up $22.4 billion as businesses continued to make long term commitments to the Microsoft platform. Within our server and tools business, we continue to make significant improvements in performance reliability and scalability with SQL server. As a result, customers are increasingly moving mission critical and BI workloads to the platform. Our SQL Server has been the unit share leader in the market for some time. It has consistently outgrown in the market over the past 12 months and is now the second largest database in revenue share.
We recently announced the next versions of Windows Server and System Center which will continue to deliver on our Cloud OS vision. With new features and enhancements in virtualization, storage and networking, we are empowering our customers to more officially manage their application services and their private, hosted and public cloud infrastructures.
In Windows Azure, we continue to innovate and broaden our cloud platform offering. We recently announced an important enterprise partnership with Oracle. It will enable customers to our Oracle software on Hyper-V and in Windows Azure. In June, we announced the public review of Windows Azure in China, operated by 21Vianet making Microsoft the first multinational organization to offer public cloud services in China.
As a result of the greater choice and flexibility, we are seeing increased customer tractions, those in terms of an increase in Enterprise customers but also the average deal size. Our productivity solutions continue to be a top priority for CIOs. As Enterprise customers look to modernize their productivity infrastructures, they are increasingly turning to Office 365.
We recently announced the expansion of commercial availability into several new markets, making Office 365 available in over 125 markets worldwide. I’m pleased to share that momentum is accelerating. An Office 365 is now on a $1.5 billion annual revenue run rate.
During the quarter, we saw ongoing momentum for our consumer services such as Office 365 Home Premium, SkyDrive, Xbox LIVE, Skype and Outlook.com. By giving consumers rich, high value experiences across productivity, litigations and entertainment, these services can help you about products and our overall ecosystem, our strategic advantage in today’s marketplace where the line between home and work is boring for many customers.
Our unified communication offering of Skype and Lync are great example of our customer enterprise products can be mutually reinforcing and create more opportunity for Microsoft. In summary, the third quarter contains many of the trends we saw developing throughout the fiscal year.
We continue to make important stride for our strategy, to create a family of devices and services for individuals and businesses, to empower them for the activities they value the most. Some of our investments are already paying off while others reinforce the foundation that positions us for future growth and profitability.
With that, I’ll hand it over to Chris to get more details about this quarter before I come back to share thoughts on the first quarter of fiscal 2014.
Chris Suh
Thanks Amy. First, I’m going to review our overall results and then I'll move onto the details by business segment. Revenue was up 3% to $19.2 billion and operating income declined 11% to $6.2 billion. Earnings per share declined 19% to $0.59. Foreign exchange had $257 million or 1 percentage point negative impact revenue this quarter and $177 million or 3 percentage point negative impact to net income.
From a geographic perspective, revenue in the U.S. was strong relative to other regions. Annuity revenue continued to be strong growing 13%. We have record unearned revenue of $22.4 billion and our contracted-not-billed balance was approximately $21 billion.
Now, to the result of the Windows division, our revenue declined 5% this quarter. The x86 PC market continued to decline while business PC showed modest growth. We estimate consumer PCs declined more than 20%. As a result, OEM revenue declined 15%.
OEM revenue lagged the PC market primarily due to market dynamics in China and lower ASPs reflecting the introduction of our small screen touch offering in the current period incentive program. Non-OEM revenue grew 22% driven by sales of Surface and continued double-digit growth in volume licensing as businesses across all areas and segments continue to value the Windows platform.
This quarter we saw continued progress in the transition from Windows XP and today almost three-quarters of enterprise desktops are running Windows 7. Volume licensing of Windows delivered more than $4 billion in revenue this year.
Next, I’ll walk through our Server and Tools business which posted another solid quarter with 9% revenue growth and double-digit bookings growth. Product revenue grew 9%, driven primarily by growth in premium versions of Windows, Server and SQL Server .Our cloud momentum continues with strong customer adoption, upsell the higher level services and increased innovation. We released a number of Azure services, including mobility, media and website services and a growing number of customers who are already using multiple services for the cloud platform needs. We added 25% more enterprise customers this quarter and now over 50% of the Fortune 500 are using Windows Azure.
In the data center, system center revenue grew 14% and the premium version of Windows Server continued to see significant revenue growth. Hyper-V, our virtualization product, continued to gain market share over the past year. Companies such as Aston Martin and Grant Thornton continue to look to Hyper-V and System Center to deliver their critical business application.
In the data platform business, SQL Server revenue grew 16% and again outpaced the broader market. Last month, we announced SQL Server 2014, the next version of our data platform which has in-memory capabilities built right into the core database. We also announced Power VI for Office 365, a cloud based BI solutions that combine power of SQL server with the familiarity of Office.
Now I'll move on to the Microsoft Business Division where revenue grew 2%. Within that, business revenue grew 7%, driven by 10% growth in annuity revenue. Consumer revenue declined 27%. Results in our consumer business were driven by declines in the consumer x86 PC market and the shift to subscription, offset in part by attach gains. As our customers transition to the new subscription model, there is a short term impact to revenue due to the changes in the timing of revenue recognition but over time we expect our revenue to grow and become more recurring and predictable.
With the subscription model, we are providing greater value to our customers with the frequent product updates, new cloud services and attractive pricing. We saw strong early adoption of the subscription offering and now have more than 1 million Office 365 Home Premium subscribers. It's been a big year for Office 365 and as Amy said, it's now on a $1.5 billion annual revenue run rate. This was our strongest quarter ever with more net fee adds in the quarter than all of fiscal 2012. We are seeing strong upsell with one in three Office 365 now running premium workloads.
In terms of our productivity offerings, we continue to see strength of Exchange, SharePoint and Lync each growing double-digits. Lync revenue grew over 30% driving our enterprise communication business to deliver more than $1 billion revenue in this fiscal year. Additionally, we met a key milestone in the Lync and Skype integration and users can now seamlessly communicate in voice and IM across the two services.
Next, I'll move on to the Online Services division where revenue grew 9% and operating performance improved by $107 million or 22%. Online advertising revenue was up 11% driven by both rate and volume improvements in our search business.
In the Entertainment and Devices division, revenue grew 8%. Xbox LIVE transaction revenue grew nearly 20% and is providing economic opportunities for publishers in the soft console market. This quarter we announced our next generation gaming and entertainment console Xbox One and at E3 we showcased in impressive line of games that will be coming to the new platform.
Progress with Windows Phone continues as our partners, including Nokia, Samsung, Huawei and HTC are delivering new phones at a broader range of price points. Telefonica also recently announced an enhanced marketing effort to promote Windows Phone 8 devices and with the recent Sprint announcement, Windows Phone 8 devices will now be available on all major U.S. operators.
Now I'll cover the remainder of the income statement. Cost of goods sold increased 14% principally driven by Surface and growth in cloud infrastructure. Operating expenses grew 9% primarily related to sales and marketing for Surface and Windows 8. This quarter, our CapEx increased as we continued to invest in our cloud infrastructure and expand our geographic footprint to support the growth in our online businesses. And finally we returned $2.9 billion to shareholders in buybacks and dividends.
Now, I'll turn the call back to Amy for our outlook.
Amy Hood
Thanks Chris. Before I discuss our expectations for the first quarter, I’d like to spend a few minutes discussing last week’s announcements on One Microsoft. If you haven’t already done so, I encourage you to read out strategy memo and Steve Ballmer's email to employees. Microsoft is rallying to hide a single strategy. As a part of this, we implemented a new organizational structure that will allow us to advance our strategy more quickly and more efficiently.
We are currently in the process of determining what changes, if any, will be made to our reporting segment. In late September, we will host an analyst event, here in Redmond, at which point we will discuss our strategy, our new organizational structure and any changes to our reporting segments. We will also give more thoughts on our full-year outlook at that time. Please look for additional details from Chris over the coming weeks.
Now, moving on to our expectations for the first quarter. In Windows, we expect revenues to continue to be negatively impacted by the decline in the consumer x86 PC market. Excluding the impact of the Windows upgrade offer in the prior year, OEM revenue should account for approximately 65% of the division's revenue and should decline mid teens. Non-OEM revenue should account for approximately 35% of the division's revenue primarily reflecting revenue from volume licensing and Surface including Surface RT at new price points.
While updating your model, please keep in mind that in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, prior to the launch of Surface, OEM accounted for 75% of the division's total revenue. Within Server & Tools, product revenue including transactional and multi-year licensing is about 80% of the division's total. Our Enterprise services is the remaining 20%.
We expect both product and enterprise services revenue to grow high-single digits. In the Microsoft Business Division, we expect business revenue to account for approximately 85% of the division's total. Our consumer revenue should account for the remaining 15%. Business revenue should grow mid-single digit reflecting low double-digit growth in annuity and the shift from transaction licensing to Cloud services.
With the ongoing shift to subscription, consumer revenue will lag the x86 consumer PC market by approximately 5 percentage points, even as the tax continues to grow. This excludes the impact of the Office upgrade offer in the prior year. As a reminder, business revenue accounted for 80% of total revenue in the prior year.
In the online services division, we expect revenue to grow low double digits reflecting growth in service revenue partially offset by lower display revenue. With the Entertainment and Devices divisions, we expect revenue to decline low-single digits as the industry waits the next generation console.
For the first quarter, cost of goods sold will reflect surface as well as the impact of the capital expenditures we made in fiscal 2013. As a result, COG should grow over 20%. Other income and expense includes dividend and interest income offset the interest expense and the net cost of hedging. In the current low interest environment, we expect these items to generally offset.
For the first quarter regarding CapEx, we expect continued growth in our investments and our global data centers. Excluding the impact of the Windows and Office upgrade offers, unearned revenue should roughly follow historical seasonal pattern.
Now, turning briefly to the full fiscal year, we are reducing our operating expense guidance. We now expect fiscal year 2014 operating expenses to be $31.3 billion to $31.9 billion with growth in the low teens for the first quarter. We expect our tax rates to be between 18% and 21% for the full fiscal year.
In summary, as we look back on the year, fiscal 2013 was a pivotal time for Microsoft. With Windows 8, we increased our addressable market. Our OEM partners have started capitalizing on the new opportunities delivering a wide range of new Windows hardware, from phones, the tablets to new PCs.
We extended our first party devices through Surface and the announcement of Xbox One. We modernized productivity with Office 365 changing our business model. For the first time, both businesses and consumers can now access Office through subscription. We took share from key competitors and key enterprise markets. We added several new features, including infrastructure as a service capabilities for Windows Azure. With Azure we are fundamentally changing the way businesses manage their IT infrastructure and we continue the expansion of our data center footprint which enables us to deliver high value services and experiences globally.
As we look to fiscal 2014, we are focused on a single strategy. With our new organizational structure, we believe we'll be able to execute more quickly and more efficiently driving long term growth profitability and shareholder value.
With that I'll turn it back to Chris and we'll take some questions.
Chris Suh
Thanks Amy. We want to get to question from as many of you as possible, so please just stick to one question. Operator, please go ahead and repeat your instructions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) And we do have our first question from Walter Pritchard from Citigroup.
Walter Pritchard - Citigroup
I am wondering if you could talk a little bit about -- you talked about COGs in Q1 and you don’t mention COGs, obviously you have Xbox One launch in the second quarter. Could you give us some guidance about how we should think about that product having an impact on margins, maybe comparing it to 360 or anything else you could do to help us directionally with the COGs impact on Q1?
Amy Hood
So as we transition to a device services company, I think you need to keep in mind that we expect CapEx continue to grow throughout our business, specifically the Xbox One and the new generation of consoles and launches I think you should think about that, as to think about all console life cycles, and so keep that in mind as you model COGs and seasonality throughout the year.
Operator
Our next question comes from Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein.
Mark Moerdler - Sanford Bernstein
Can you give us some color on the short term revenue impact of the move to the cloud, is it just MBD, is it also server and tools, how does the license revenue convert to cloud revenue?
Amy Hood
Mark, thanks for that question. It is primarily an MBD where we had a higher percentage of our revenue, that was accounted for transactionally both on the business side and in the consumer side. So I think that’s why you’ve seen us in our outlook for Q1 try to start to explain that transition to consumer by saying that we expect to lag the PC market by approximately 5 percentage points while attaching pieces.
Mark Moerdler - Sanford Bernstein
Is there a similar lag on the transactional side on the enterprise?
Amy Hood
Yes, you can see it when we gave the guidance for the business segment. We said 10% growth on the annuity and so that would clearly say that part of that is a transactional move from recognize upfront revenue to multi-year licensing agreement.
Operator
Our next question comes from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.
Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse
Just a follow up on (inaudible), first, Amy, obviously you go to a subscription model, you have less upfront, lower billing versus license, why don’t you give us a sort of a backdoor, a dollar of cloud or 365 revenue would have been, and that for sure should have been $3 relative to license, so just we can turn it back on to help with that transition and also actually to Walter’s question about Xbox COGs, maybe you could add a sense for -- if this cycle really should be any different than previous cycles when you thought about pricing relative to the cost of the console?
Amy Hood
I will try to remember both of those questions. Let me take the second question as it’s the most recent in my mind. I would not think about this console cycle being any different from prior cycles. So let me go back to the first question, which is can I give examples, I believe we probably think about the transition front, we used to recognize revenue when we bought something upfront transactionally versus buying a subscription from us. I will give an example. If you used to buy a license from us as a consumer and paid up for example $100 for (inaudible), we recognize $100 in the period in which it was purchased.
Now if that same person went and bought Office 365 Premium, and once it’s activated, we recognize the revenue over the period of the purchase which is 12 months, we recognize it ratably.
Chris Suh
Yeah, thanks. Next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley
Excellent. Thank you guys for taking my question. I was wondering focusing on the Server & Tools division you guys came in with high single-digit growth versus the guidance of low double-digit growth. Also can you walk us through some of the elements that perhaps transpired during the quarter than caused that gap of why it came in slightly below expectations there and to what extent was the shift towards subscription a part of that.
Amy Hood
Let me start by saying Server & Tools had a very good quarter. We continue to win share in virtualization, the SQL Server and could continue to go faster than both Oracle and IBM. Revenue did grow 9%, which importantly far outpaced the underlying hardware market. And over the period of the quarter, we did see the hardware market fundamentally coming a bit lower than we had expected.
Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley
Okay.
Chris Suh
Great. Thanks Keith. Next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs
Great. Thank you very much. Amy, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the incentive pricing you’ve been doing, not just on your own devices like Chris mentioned in his prepared remarks but also in the OEM market. And if you haven’t done incentive pricing at the OEM level, is there a chance we could see the strategy going forward at a way to help lower the price points of consumer PCs and then hence trying to spur demand? Thank you.
Amy Hood
Thanks Heather. I think it’s a great question. I do think that we should think about incentives and all of our programs, including a Small Screen Touch view that we’ve launched, as a way to increase the breadth of our Windows devices available across all price points.
Chris Suh
Thank you, Heather. Next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Rick Sherlund with Nomura. Your line is now open.
Rick Sherlund - Nomura
Thanks. I wonder if you have any perspective for us on you got Intel’s Haswell chip shipping now 8.1 coming in probably October. Are you sensing that OEMs are trying to manage inventories down for the time being and waiting cautiously Intel suggested that maybe you’re seeing some inventory liquidation. So I wonder if you could just give us a sense of what you’re hearing from the OEMs?
Amy Hood
Thanks Rick. I think like the rest of the ecosystem, we are excited about the advances Intel has made with the fourth-generation core processor. And we’re also looking forward to the next ADAM chip but was launched a little less than a month ago. I think it’s little bit too early for me to say and like to wait and see how the quarter plays out.
Chris Suh
Rick, next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes to us from Brent Thill with UBS. Your line is now open.
Brent Thill - UBS
Amy, on the expenses you are realizing next year down and it looks like your expense growth will materially slow from what it was this year. I’m just curious if you could just help us understand where that’s coming from and how you’re thinking about that for next year.
Amy Hood
Well, actually I think this is I feel good because I think in some ways the re-org we announced last week along with our increased focus and our new single strategy has allowed us to really look and say what are the things we’re going to put behind and focus to improve our execution. And so I feel quite good about our ability to do that and you heard us say before many of the reasons we did this re-org are about doing things better and more efficiently.
Chris Suh
Thank you. Thanks Brent. Next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Ed Maguire with CLSA. Your line is now open.
Ed Maguire - CLSA
Hi. Good afternoon. Amy, you had discussed your increased CapEx this quarter and I was wondering if you could address the margin profile of your cloud services. In the comments, you discussed how you have higher datacenter cost and what I’d like to understand is whether this is temporary as you are ramping up this transition towards subscription business or whether this actually changes the growth margin profile of these revenues. Thanks.
Amy Hood
Thanks Ed. It’s a good question. Every transition to device and services company that is a multiyear commitment to evolve our business. You should expect the CapEx will continue to grow as we ramp that business. With the expansion of Azure service offerings and the continued momentum and Office 365 as well as our consumer services, investing in this global footprint to meet customer demand is incredibly important and quite strategic. And really the question is, our ability to feel smart way and that will create an advantage for us, we can pass along to our customers. And so I look forward to being able to move these datacenters globally to reach more people with more services.
Chris Suh
Okay. Thanks, Ed. Operator next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from John DiFucci with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
John DiFucci - JPMorgan
Thank you. Amy your CapEx this quarter was about $700 million, greater than $700 million, greater than you guided just 90 days ago. Why was there such a sudden change, I know, Chris I think explained why it was high -- higher and why it’s going to be higher going forward? But why was it such a sudden change so dramatically just in this quarter and will this planned increase going forward affect your ability to do things like buyback shares?
Amy Hood
Yeah. Our -- in Q4 really as we continue to add Azure services, in fact we added over 80 this quarter and with this increase demand of Office 365 and then $1.5 billion annual run rate, up from just a $1 billion in Q3. I would think about that as our ability to increase demand and meet demand globally with our services, and so doing that in Q4 was important, because you want to be ahead of demand there.
John DiFucci - JPMorgan
So was that something that was unexpected, you just said, higher demand in Q4?
Amy Hood
We are accelerating.
John DiFucci - JPMorgan
Okay. Okay. And will this affect your ability to buyback shares going forward, this increase in CapEx?
Amy Hood
No. I mean, our cash returned $2.9 billion this quarter, I recall for the year and we’ll continue take a balanced approach to capital allocation with those investments, acquisition really make sense and return the capital to shareholders.
Chris Suh
Okay. Next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open
Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch
Hi. Thank you very much. Amy congrats on your first conference call as CFO. My question had to do with Windows side of the business. I know that you had a impairment charge for the inventory clearance. But even if I backed, if I add that back, it looks like the operating margin of the Windows business were sequentially lower, quite materially just wanted to get some insights into what drove that from the March quarter into the June quarter?
As you look further out into the operating margins of the Windows business, given that you are going to be focusing on Surface? How should we think about the margin structure, I guess you have a volume threshold to clear before you can start to make a margin, given that it’s more of a product? But really two parts to that question, love to get your answers? Thank you so much.
Amy Hood
Thanks Kash. Let me address, I think were the two components. The first component, like a general question about margins this quarter for Windows, as you said they were impacted by Surface. And the second one is, by the marketing investment we continue to make in the ecosystem to move forward.
Overall, I think, as you think about the Windows division as we reported, obviously since there was mix between hardware and software, you should continue to expect margins to reflect that mix.
Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch
Okay.
Chris Suh
Thank you, Kash. Next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Ross MacMillan with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Ross MacMillan - Jefferies
Thanks a lot. Amy, I just wanted to drill into the billings growth, where we adjust for the unearned and it’s a lot higher for the server and tools business, which is obviously going through a condition towards more a subscription arrangements then it a lot higher there in the MBD segment?
I’m just wondering if you can compare and contrast why that might be, I understand the consumer piece in MBD. But is the other piece of it just that there are more sort of conditional licensing arrangements in MBD with enterprise customers and so the impact from the transition is all the greater and that’s why you see that more subdued billings growth rate in MBD? Thanks.
Amy Hood
Ross, thank you. It’s always terrific when someone answers their own question. You actually have it exactly correct.
Ross MacMillan - Jefferies
Great. Thank you.
Chris Suh
Thanks. Thanks Ross. Next question please.
Operator
The next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen. Your line is now open.
Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen
Hi. Thank you very much and good afternoon. Just a follow on a bit on Kash’s question. With Windows revenue coming in where it did. We are getting a few questions from investors about how Windows fared this quarter relative to the PC unit? If we were to exclude tablet revenues both Surface and otherwise. Just wondering Amy if you might be able to say roughly on year-over-year basis how Windows PC revenue compared to the low double-digit PC unit decline cited by the IDC’s and Gartner’s?
Amy Hood
Yeah. Chris actually covered that a bit in his comment but let me reiterate, because I do understand the question I think, which is relate to our OEM revenue 15%, down 15%. It was related, I believe to China, lower ASPs on the small stream SKU that we mentioned, as well as some of the incentive programs that we had in place during the quarter.
Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen
Thank you.
Chris Suh
Thanks Gregg. Next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Raimo Lenschow - Barclays
Yeah. Thank you and Amy welcome on the first earnings call. And I had a question on the business PC side, that was an area of strength for the Windows division and you saw some growth there? Can you talk a little bit about that, if that’s kind of, if you see that as a sustainable number or is that still driven by the end of life for Windows XP? Thank you.
Amy Hood
As we mentioned, our Windows business didn't make incremental progress in the business side. We expect that to continue in Q1. And with the end of life for Windows XP next year, we expect continued migration and today in the Enterprise about three quarters of desktops already run Windows 7.
Raimo Lenschow - Barclays
Okay. Thank you very much.
Chris Suh
Yeah. Thank you. Next question please, operator?
Operator
All right. Our next question comes from Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is now open.
Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities
Thanks so much. Amy contracted-but unbilled was down sequentially from Q3, the first time we have seen that in the last two years, what is attributing to that shift?
Amy Hood
Thank you. Actually I think our strong annuity growth, as well as our record unearned balance, I do believe -- support our belief that the strong performance of our multiyear license agreement is in place.
Chris Suh
Thank you, Operator. I think we have time for one more.
Operator
Okay. The next question is going to come from Karl Keirstead with BMO Capital Markets. You line is open.
Karl Keirstead - BMO Capital Markets
Thanks. I just wanted to ask a question about the mix shift multiyear licensing across Microsoft that’s been a big part of the story. It has been up about 5 percentage points year-over-year each quarter in fiscal 2013? Amy, I’m just wondering as we look forward to fiscal ’14, can we expect it to increase at that cliff or is the software assurance attach rates now getting high enough that that mix shift should start to moderate?
Amy Hood
We have -- I continue to believe we will have double-digit annuity growth next year, so I think that shift you have seen especially if we continue to move people to our Cloud services, will continue.
Karl Keirstead - BMO Capital Markets
Okay. Thanks
Chris Suh
Thanks, Karl. Okay. So that will wrap up our Q&A portion of today's earnings calls. We look forward to seeing many of you in the coming months at various investor conferences and at our financial analyst meeting to be held in late September where we will share more details about our long-term strategies, the organizational structure and outlook for the rest of the fiscal year. Thank you again for joining us today.

Welcome to Microsoft's fiscal year 2013 third quarter earnings conference call. [Operator instructions.]  I would now like to turn the call over to Chris Suh, general manager of investor relations. Chris, you may begin.
Chris Suh
Thank you operator, and thanks everyone for joining us this afternoon. With me today are Peter Klein, chief financial officer; Frank Brod, chief accounting officer; and John Seethoff, deputy general counsel.
On our website, microsoft.com/investor, is our financial summary slide deck, which is intended to follow our prepared remarks and provides a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. As a reminder, we will post today's prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available.
Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript at the Microsoft investor relations website until April 18, 2014.
During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements that are predictions, protection or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties.
Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the risk factor section of our Form 10K, Form 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
Before I hand the call over to Peter, I would like to remind you all that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year. Also, unless specified otherwise, all impacted numbers for the current quarter have been adjusted for the cumulative effect of the revenue deferral and recognition related to Windows, Office, and Xbox videogame and the expense related to the non-tax-deductible European Commission fine.  Details of the adjustments can be found in our financial summary slide deck and press release.
And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Peter.
Peter Klein 
Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon everyone.  Before I get into my comments about the quarter, let me say a few words about the CFO transition we announced today.  As we all do throughout our careers, at various times we assess our personal and professional goals and priorities.  Sometimes we change jobs, sometimes we change companies, and sometimes we step back to focus on family and other personal goals.
As we approach the end of our fiscal year, for me personally, it’s a good time to refocus my priorities to spend time with family in a way I haven’t previously had the chance.  I feel great that the company is on a path to an exciting future in devices and services, and I couldn’t be more proud of, and confident in, the finance organization.
I look forward to working with my successor on the transition, including getting out and meeting with many of you.  I have truly enjoyed working with all of you.  And now on to the quarter.
I’m pleased to report we drove revenue and earnings per share growth of 8%, even as we navigate an evolving device market.  Our results reflect our diversified portfolio as well as the investments we have made in key strategic areas.  During the quarter, we launched the new Office, our enterprise cloud services continued to gain traction, and we continued to take market share in the data platform.
Before I dive into more details on our progress in these areas, I want to address what’s top of mind for many of you, which is our Windows business.
There is no doubt that the device market is evolving.  Consumers and businesses are increasingly shifting their focus to touch and mobility, and as a result, they want touch-enabled computing devices that are ultrathin, lightweight, and have long battery life.  While Windows revenue has been impacted by the transition from the traditional PC to a new era of computing devices, the overall addressable markets are growing, and we are excited by the opportunities ahead of us.
We built Windows 8 with touch and mobility at the center of the experience, which positions us well in this new era.  However, the transition is complicated, given the size of our hardware and software ecosystem.  We still have an immense amount of work to do, yet we feel good about the foundation we have laid and are optimistic about the long term success of Windows.
I want to take some time now to be clear about where we are in this journey, and what we are doing to help drive this change.  With Windows 8, we are setting a new, accelerated pace for updates and innovations, as we focus on making the Windows experience richer and better.
Since launch we have delivered several important updates to improve our mail, storage, search, music, and video services.  During the quarter, we also added to the Surface family of devices with Surface Pro, which combines the performance capabilities of a PC with a modern tablet design.
Looking ahead, we will release the next version of Windows, codenamed Windows Blue, which further advances the vision of Windows 8 as well as responds to customer feedback.  The assortment of touch-enabled devices that are built for Windows 8 by our OEM partners is also improving.
Over the last couple of months, we’ve started seeing devices that take full advantage of Windows 8, and we expect to see more devices across more attractive price points over the coming months.  As part of this, we are also working closely with OEMs on a new suite of small touch devices powered by Windows.  These devices will have competitive price points, partly enabled by our latest OEM offerings designed specifically for these smaller devices, and will be available in the coming months.
In the upcoming back to school selling season, we expect to see devices that incorporate advances from throughout the supply chain, including chipsets.  As well, Intel’s fourth generation core processor will help enable new devices that combine performance benefits with power savings. Later in the year, we expect to see devices based on Intel’s upcoming Bay Trail Atom processor, which promises to deliver tablets and hybrid PCs with extended battery life at competitive prices.
Today in the Windows Store, there are six times as many apps since launch, and we expect more to be added as we gain traction with Windows 8 adoption.  In June, we will host Build, our developer conference, where we will provide more tools and information for developers to build great Windows 8 apps.
In retail, we are working to improve the consumer purchasing experience.  Our initiatives include focused efforts to further educate and incentivize retail sales professionals and to have better in-store product differentiation.
In summary, Windows is transforming to the new era of computing.  As I said on our last earnings call, growth in Windows depends on our ability to give customers the exciting hardware they want at the price points they demand, and a wider range of apps and services to meet their diverse need.  We are hard at work with our partners to meet these goals, and we’re confident we are moving in the right direction.
Now, switching gears to productivity, this quarter we launched the latest version of Office, which brings mobility, social, and cloud features to the world’s most popular productivity app.  Importantly, the new Office represents a fundamental shift in our model.  Now both businesses and consumers can access Office through subscription.
With this shift, we expect to grow our customer base, increase customer satisfaction via continuous updates, and reduce piracy.  As our enterprise customers modernize their productivity infrastructures, we are confident that they will continue to deploy Office 365.  We also expect our transactional customers to increasingly transition to the cloud with Office 365.
It’s been a while now that we’ve been talking about our investments in the cloud, and I’m pleased to share that we are starting to realize the benefits of those investments in a meaningful way.
Office 365 lights up with this latest release, as evidenced by our growing customer adoption.  This quarter was our strongest ever, with net seat additions up 5 times over the prior year.  One in four of our enterprise customers now has Office 365, and the business is on a $1 billion annual revenue run rate.
Our server and tools business continues its momentum with yet another solid quarter of revenue growth.  Within the data platform, we continue to take share, with our strength in mission critical and business intelligence workloads.  Enterprise has recognized the power of SQL Server to unlock business insights, and as a result, we continue to significantly outpace the market and are seeing new deployments and very healthy renewals.
In enterprise cloud, just in the last week, we launched our Windows Azure Active Directory and infrastructure as a service offering on Windows Azure.  This innovation across platform and infrastructure services uniquely positions Microsoft as the only cloud provider who can offer customers a comprehensive hybrid cloud solution that integrates existing IT infrastructure with all the benefits of the public cloud.
Xbox continues to be at the center of our living room strategy, having evolved from gaming to an entertainment platform.  Whether they are playing games, being social, or watching movies, consumers continue to be drawn to Xbox Live.  Xbox Live now has over 46 million members, up 18% from the prior year.  Clearly there’s a lot of momentum, and with E3 only a couple of months away, we look forward to sharing more shortly.
In summary, our diversified portfolio drove solid revenue and earnings per share growth.  We are hard at work here at Microsoft and with our partners to drive Windows 8 adoption forward.  At the same time, we have strong momentum in our enterprise businesses, including our cloud services.  Combined with our unique consumer assets like Xbox Live and Skype, we are well-positioned to deliver on our devices and services strategy.
And with that, I’ll hand it over to Chris to discuss our quarterly results in more detail.  I’ll then come back to discuss our expectations for the fourth quarter and beyond.
Chris Suh
Thank you, Peter.  First, I’m going to review our overall results, and then I’ll move on to the details by business segment.  Our diversified portfolio helped us deliver solid financial growth this quarter.  Revenue was up 8% to $18.8 billion, and operating income increased 5% to $6.7 billion.  Earnings per share grew 8% to $0.65.
Foreign exchange had a $180 million, or 1 percentage point, negative impact to revenue this quarter and a $99 million, or 2 percentage point negative impact to net income.  From a geographic perspective, we saw similar growth rates across both developed and emerging markets.
Multiyear licensing revenue continued to be strong, growing 16%.  Additionally, unearned revenue grew 13% to $17.1 billion.  And our contracted not billed balance was over $21 billion.
In the Windows division, revenue was flat this quarter.  Within that, OEM revenue performance was in line with the underlying x86 PC market, which continues to be challenged as the PC market evolves beyond the traditional PC to touch and mobile devices.  This quarter, inventory levels were drawn down as the channel awaits new Windows 8 devices.
Non-OEM revenue grew 40% this quarter, driven by sales of Surface and continued double digit growth in volume licensing.  Businesses continue to value the Windows platform, and volume licensing of Windows is on track to deliver almost $4 billion in revenue this year, and nearly three-quarters of enterprise agreements that we signed this year include Windows.
Additionally, this quarter we saw continued progress in the transition of Windows XP to Windows 7, and now two-thirds of enterprise desktops are running Windows 7.
Next, I’ll move on to our server and tools business, where we continue to have good momentum.  Revenue grew 11%, highlighted by multiyear licensing revenue, which grew 20%.  The strength in multiyear licensing reflects the commitment and confidence that our customers have in our products and roadmap.
In the data center, the premium version of Windows Server, which targets tier one application workloads, saw significant revenue growth again this quarter.  Companies such as Domino’s Pizza and Xerox continue to look to Hyper-V and Systems Center to deliver their critical business applications.  Revenue for Systems Center grew 22% and Hyper-V, our virtualization product, has gained four points of market share over the past year.
Our momentum in public cloud continues with more innovation, greater customer adoption, and a comprehensive suite of offerings.  Enterprise customers like NBC Sports and 3M continue to choose Windows Azure for their cloud platform needs.  Recently, we launched Windows Azure Active Directory, which is an identity and access management solution designed to support cloud-based line of business applications.
Today, over 2.9 million businesses, government bodies, and schools are already enjoying the benefits of Windows Azure Active Directory, using it to manage access to Office 365, Dynamic CRM Online, Windows Intune, and Windows Azure.
In our data platform business, SQL Server revenue grew 16%, and again outpaced the broader market.  Usage of SQL Server for tier one applications continues to grow, based on functionality, reliability, and value.  In addition to our efforts in big data, we are developing in-memory BI technologies built right into SQL Server that achieve breakthrough improvements in transaction processing.
Now, I’ll move on to the Microsoft business division, where revenue grew 5%.  Within that, business revenue grew 10%, driven by 16% growth in multiyear licensing.  In January, we launched the new Office for consumers.  The new Office introduces touch, social, and mobile scenarios as well as tight integration with SkyDrive, enabling access to documents from any device.
The new Office is also available as a subscription, which benefits customers as they are always using the most modern version of Office.  As Peter stated, we expect the shift to grow our customer base, and we saw strong early adoption of the subscription service.
I would like to remind you that with subscription, the revenue is earned ratably over the length of the subscription, rather than at the initial purchase.  All up, consumer revenue was roughly in line with the consumer PC market, influenced by the shift to subscription and strong [attach] gain.
In terms of our productivity server offerings, we continue to see strength with Exchange, SharePoint, and Lync, each growing double digits.  Specifically, Lynch revenue grew over 30% again this quarter, with excitement around the platform continuing to grow.  90 of the Fortune 100 companies are now using Lync, and there are more than 5 million seats of Enterprise Voice deployed.
At our Lync 2013 conference in February, we announced that Lync and Skype connectivity for presence, instant messaging, and voice will be available for all Lync users by the end of June.  Connecting these audiences was a key milestone as we deliver on the promise of truly unified communications.
Next I’ll move on to the online services division, where revenue grew 18%.  Online advertising revenue was up 22%, driven by another quarter of significant search rate improvement.  Operating performance improved 45% this quarter, driven by revenue growth and continued expense management.
In the entertainment and devices division, revenue grew 33%.  Xbox sold 1.3 million consoles and maintained its share position in the soft console market.  Xbox Live continued its strong momentum, and we continuously look for ways to further extend the value of Xbox Live for both our members and content partners.
As evidence of the expanding benefits, we saw transactional revenue grow roughly twice as fast as member growth this quarter.  Momentum with Windows Phone continues to build.  The device is now available in a broad range of price points.  We’re receiving great reviews and carrier support continues to grow.
We now have over 10% share in several countries, but realize there is still a lot of work ahead to break through in some key markets.  The growing awareness of Windows Phone has sustained innovation from our hardware partners, and we feel well-positioned to continue our momentum.
Now I’ll cover the remainder of the income statement.  Cost of goods sold increased 21%, principally driven by Surface, growth in cloud infrastructure, and royalties on Xbox Live content and videogames.  Operating expenses grew 4%, primarily related to product launch marketing.  This quarter, our effective tax rate was approximately 19%, and finally, we returned $2.9 billion to shareholders in buybacks and dividends.
Now I’ll turn the call back to Peter for our outlook.
Peter Klein 
Thanks, Chris.  For the remainder of the call, I will discuss our expectations for the fourth quarter, and share some thoughts on fiscal year 2014.  Let me start with the fourth quarter.
In the Windows division, similar to this quarter, revenue will continue to reflect sales of Surface and strong volume licensing, while OEM revenue will be impacted by the declining traditional PC market as we work to increase our share in tablets.
Within server and tools, product revenue, including transactional and multiyear licensing, is about 80% of the division total revenue.  Enterprise services is the remaining 20%.  We expect both product and enterprise services revenue to grow low double-digits.
In the Microsoft business division, multiyear licensing revenue, which is approximately 60% of the division’s total, should grow low double digits.  Excluding the recognition of revenue from the Office upgrade offer, transactional revenue, which is the remaining 40% of the division total, should be in line with the x86 PC market.
As a reminder, when updating your Q4 models, we expect to recognize approximately $780 million of revenue related to the Office upgrade offer.  In the online services division, we expect revenue to grow low double-digits, reflecting growth in search revenue, partially offset by lower display revenue.
Moving on to the entertainment and devices division, we expect revenue to grow mid teens.  For the fourth quarter, we expect COGS to grow mid teens, including Surface.  Other income and expense includes dividend and interest income, offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging.  In the current low interest rate environment, we expect these items to generally offset.
We are reducing our full fiscal year guidance for operating expenses to $30.2 billion to $30.5 billion.  This range excludes the impact of the European Commission fine of $733 million.
At the full fiscal year, we expect our effective tax rate, excluding the expense related to the European Commission fine, to be 17-20%, and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be about $3.5 billion.  Excluding the impact of the Office upgrade offer, unearned revenue should roughly follow historical seasonal patterns.
Now turning to fiscal 2014, we expect fiscal 2014 operating expenses to be $31.6 billion to $32.2 billion, which represents growth of 4-6% from the midpoint of our updated fiscal 2013 guidance.  We will continue to prioritize our spending while investing in the significant opportunity that is ahead of us.
As we look towards the future, we have a solid foundation of products and services in market, and our leadership team is collectively focused on advancing every one of our businesses.  You can expect to hear more about the specific actions we are taking over the next few months.
And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Chris and we’ll take some questions.
Chris Suh
Thanks, Peter.  We want to get questions from as many of you as possible, so please just keep to one question.  Operator, please go ahead and repeat your instructions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator instructions.]  And our first question comes from Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein.  Your line is open, sir.
Mark Moerdler - Sanford Bernstein
Thanks for the cloud data.  We’ve been looking for a lot of this, so it’s very helpful.  Let me ask two related parts to that.  Can you give us a sense on the growth metrics in terms of Office 365, which is what you’re starting to give here, in terms of revenue, users, customers, something that we can think about there?  And the second half of it, can you give us a sense in terms of the percentage of Office 365 customers that are net new to Exchange?  I know you’ve given little bits of data on SMB and new SMB customers, but any sense there would be appreciated.
Peter Klein 
On Office 365, the metric that we gave was net seat additions were up 5 times over the prior year, so that gives you some growth metric in addition to the revenue number.
To your point on Exchange or more broadly, I would say about other workloads, we’re seeing exactly that dynamic.  So not only are we addressing and reaching new customer segments like SMB, but many of them have never had a productivity server workload before.  Not just Exchange, but others as well.  And even those that had Exchange are now using other workloads, and so we’re seeing most of our customers having more than one workload.
So across every dimension in terms of new revenue streams from the service, new customer segments, and new workloads, there’s a lot of new, and that’s what’s driving the growth and the opportunity that we’ve been looking for.
Operator
And our next question is from Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse.  Your line is open, sir.
Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse 
You provided a little bit of color on Surface.  Obviously we’re seeing expanding portfolio there.  I just want to get a sense of how this evolving, especially on the distribution side, and how the product is doing versus your expectations.  And then when you start to think about going forward, how would you also expect the product portfolio to evolve, as well as distribution?
Peter Klein 
As I said, we are expanding both the product set and distribution, and that is broadly, all devices, inclusive of Surface.  We are expanding distribution of Surface.  We are now in 22 countries, 70 retailers.  And we’ll continue to look to expand that.  Not only just expanding, but improving the experience.  And that’s true not just for Surface, but for broadly Windows 8 devices.  And so we’ll be investing against that for both Surface and a broader array of Windows 8 devices at multiple price points, including lower price points going forward.
Operator
Walter Pritchard with Citigroup, your line is open.
Walter Pritchard - Citigroup
I wonder if you could weigh in.  There’s been a bit of a debate this quarter around what the underlying PC market did.  And I think you see numbers ranging out there from mid single digit declines to a mid teens decline.  I’m just wondering if you could weigh in on that.  In the past you’ve given some sort of range.
And then related to that is if you look at the second half, I’m wondering how we should set our expectations around this mid to high end Haswell release from Intel in terms of impact it may have on the PC market versus the later year, more holiday time, lower end Atom release, and how those two chip releases may have an impact on what you’re expecting from the device market and overall impact on Windows?
Peter Klein 
On the PC market, I would look to some of the third parties, IDC and Gartner.  They’re sort of in the 12-13-14 down range this quarter.  And in terms of the chipsets, we’ve always felt that with Windows 8, it was a process of the ecosystem really innovating across the board, and really starting to see that on the chips.  And we’re very encouraged by both Haswell and some of the Atom processors to really improve the overall user experience that Windows 8 delivers.  And over the coming selling season, I think that’s very encouraging and we’re optimistic about that.
Operator
Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs, your line is open.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs
We’ve heard Intel talk about Haswell, and they mentioned it on the call, I think it was last night.  You obviously mentioned it.  And I guess I’m just wondering what can you guys do to specifically help grow your tablet share given you are reliant, ex the Surface products, on OEM partners to really hit a broad segment of the market.  And I’m thinking in general, given the OEM partners don’t have much wiggle room on the margin side, what can you do to help stimulate your market share, in particular in the mobility and in the tablet side?
Peter Klein 
I think broadly, in improving our position in tablets, and generally in devices, there’s five or six dimensions ranging from what we’re doing with OEMs on the devices and the range of devices, and how they can have a range of price points.  What the chips can do, because I think that’s a part of it.  Both first party and third-party apps, and we’ve seen improvements across the board there.  The user interface, and how we’re innovating across the user experience.  And then distribution
So if you start sort of from the bottom up, all the way to when you buy the product, we’re working across all those dimensions.  And on the device side, we are working closely with the OEMs to help them take Windows 8 and show it off in all its glory, across different form factors.  I talked about new smaller form factors and how Windows 8 can innovate to improve that experience.
So I think the biggest thing we’re doing is helping them develop new and improved user experiences across the board, across size, across price point, and deliver a really compelling Windows 8 experience.  And it’s not just the devices, like I said, it’s chips, it’s the apps, it’s the buying experience, it’s the user interface.  So we’re really focused on all five or six of those dimensions going forward.
Operator
Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley, your line is open.
Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley
You mentioned on the call that going to subscription revenues does have a near term impact on your revenues.  I was wondering if you could help us understand whether we’re seeing that impact today, and perhaps to what degree, with the strong uptake of some of the cloud services, particularly like Office 365.
Peter Klein 
We are seeing that, particularly in our transactional business, in MBD, as people move from what may have been a transactional to a perpetual license, where the revenue is recognized up front, to a subscription service, where it’s recognized ratably.  So you’re basically deferring the rest of the term of the subscription.  So in the short term, you’ll be deferring revenues that were not in a subscription, and would have been recognized immediately.
And as the subscription business is growing, you’ll see that impact growing, but over time, what you’ll get is what looks like an annuity revenue stream, that’s more predictable and has higher customer satisfaction and probably higher retention rates going forward.  But in the short term, that will impact mostly in the transactional side of the MBD business.
Operator
Brent Thill with UBS, your line is open.
Brent Thill - UBS 
Peter, just on the gross margin, it’s been under pressure for the last several years, but this quarter it did bounce back.  Can you just give us a sense of how you think gross margins will trend, and do you expect a slow improvement from here or expect more of the same in terms of where they’ve been in the last couple of quarters?
Peter Klein 
Gross margins, as you know, are always going to be a function of mix.  And so depending on where you are in the quarter, the biggest driver of what your gross margin is going to be is mix.  So if you have a big hardware quarter that has low gross margins, that will impact it.
The biggest things that are going to impact the mix are going to be hardware, cloud services, and enterprise services, or people services.  It is a fact that we are starting to get scale in our cloud services, and so the growth that we’re seeing in Office 365 is really coming at an improved margin as we scale that out.
So within each, we made progress, and then overall, in any given quarter, for the company it’s going to be a function of mix.  So obviously in a holiday quarter, where you sell a bunch of hardware, that will have an impact on gross margin.
But I think one of the main takeaways for me is in particularly some of our cloud services, we’re really starting to get scale. Bing continues to improve, their margins.  And Office 365 is really starting to get to scale.  So those things are really encouraging.
Operator
Ed Maguire with CLSA, your line is open.
Ed Maguire - CLSA
You just launched your Azure infrastructure as a service.  Just went generally available this week.  And I’d love to get some color on how much that’s figuring in the growth in long term contracts, and what your expectations might be for more traditional infrastructure as a service uptake over the next several quarters.
Peter Klein 
Great question.  It’s clearly a key enabler of our cloud OS story, and how we’re driving what we’re doing with enterprise in the data center.  We have infrastructure as a service, we have now the most complete end-to-end offering through platform, and software, identity, and access.
But having the infrastructure is a key enabler, and I think a real accelerator for the Windows Azure strategy, and really more broadly the cloud OS strategy.  We now have a complete end-to-end story through the data center, from private, to hosted, to public, from infrastructure to platform, so I think it’s, again, a key enabler of that [all up] strategy, and an accelerator.
Operator
John DiFucci with JPMC, your line is open.
John DiFucci - JPMC
My question is for Chris.  Just wanted to clarify something you said about inventories.  I think you were talking about PC inventory.  But with the Windows business, can you give us your assessment of what Windows inventory is at OEMs, especially given the disappointing PC shipment data this quarter?
Chris Suh 
I did mention the fact that we believe inventories were drawn down.  We do think they’re at normal levels at this point, though.
Operator
Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company, your line is open.
Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Company
In recent periods, we’ve seen your MBD growth significantly outpace PC unit growth, although we now have a dynamic where your Office subscription is really resonating with customers.  So the question is, just looking at it on a directional basis, is MBD revenue outperformance relative to PC units something that you think is sustainable going forward?
Peter Klein 
The answer is that it will depend, and certainly an offset between attach gains we’re making against the market, offset against some deferrals as revenue moves to a subscription.  And so it will kind of depend each quarter.  Long term, it’s a great trend, because we’re building up a banked book of business on the subscription side, which will become less and less connected to the PC market.
Operator
Raimo Lenschow with Barclays, your line is open.
Raimo Lenschow - Barclays
If you look at IBM coming out earlier on today having a relatively tough quarter given the economy, can you just comment on a little bit of what you’re seeing out there, especially server and tools division obviously doing relatively well, but other guys are really struggling.  So help us understand how you see the economy.
Peter Klein 
I think about the economy, and then I think about the value proposition of our products.  Clearly there are tough spots in the economy.  I think enterprises and CIOs are looking for what they’ve always been looking for, which is how do they get the best value for their dollar to move their businesses forward.
And I think we have a very good story in terms of the value that enterprises and small and medium businesses get from the capabilities that they can get from us, particularly in the data center, with SQL.  And as you compare SQL Server to competing products, the performance that you get relative to the price is really a compelling value proposition, and that’s what’s been enabling us to take share.  The same on virtualization as well.
And so I think for us, it’s a combination of having the most complete roadmap for getting to the cloud, as well as the best collection of products that have price performance characteristics that are attractive to CIOs that are allowing us to have growth in our enterprise business, particularly in server and tools.
Operator
Our last question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel.  Your line is open.
Brad Reback - Stifel Nicolaus
Peter, as you look at the PC data over the course of the quarter, can you give us any sense of how that trended?  And following up on that, as you think about the business upgrade cycle, which should be over by this time next year, do we risk a real fall off again in the PC business, because the upgrade cycle has aided what’s been a difficult PC market the last couple of quarters?
Peter Klein 
On your first question, there wasn’t anything abnormal in terms of the trends during the quarter.  On your second question, the upgrade cycle, particularly for businesses, will be interesting over the next year.  I think over the longer term, what’s more interesting is the long term evolution we’re seeing in the device market, which I think is actually going to be more of a driver than any temporal upgrade cycle.  Innovation is happening faster, people are getting new experiences and new form factors.
I think that’s what Windows 8 was designed to take advantage of, and so I think about the opportunity more about the new capabilities and the new services, and the experience that people can get on their devices and different kinds of devices, than it is about an upgrade cycle that’s driven by something else.
Chris Suh

Welcome to Microsoft's fiscal year 2013 second quarter earnings conference call. All lines have been placed in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time.
I would now like to turn the call over to Chris Suh, General Manager of Investor Relations. Chris, you may begin.
Chris Suh
Thanks, operator and thanks, everyone for joining us this afternoon. This does feel like a bit of a homecoming. Some of you may remember, I was in IR a number of years ago. I am excited to be back and looking forward to working with all of you. With me today are Peter Klein, Chief Financial Officer, Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel.
On our website, microsoft.com/investor, is our financial summary slide deck which is intended to follow our prepared remarks and provides a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. As a reminder, we will post today's prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available.
Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript at the Microsoft investor relations website until January 24, 2014.
During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements that are predictions, protection or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the risk factor section of our Form 10K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
Before I hand the call over to Peter, I would like to remind you all that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year. Also, unless specified otherwise, all impacted numbers for the current quarter have been adjusted for the cumulative effect of the revenue deferral and recognition related to Windows, Office and Xbox videogame and the details of those adjustments can be found in our financial summary slide deck and press release.
With that I will turn it over to Peter.
Peter Klein
Thanks everyone for joining us. I am pleased to welcome Chris as the new head of investor relations. Chris has been with Microsoft for over 16 years and has been in diverse finance role which gives him a good background for this role. I also want to thank Bill for all he has accomplished over the past four years and congratulate him on his new role as the CFO of the Skype division.
This quarter we had record revenue of $22 billion and record earnings per share of $0.81. It has been an exciting quarter with the launch of Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8. In the enterprise, we continue to see solid demand for our business products and services with particularly strong growth in multiyear licensing. Multiyear licensing revenue benefited from healthy renewals of enterprise agreements as customers continue to make long-term commitments to the Microsoft platform.
Our robust portfolio of enterprise products and services enable CIOs to build efficient infrastructure, unlock business insight, improve productivity and support bring your own device. In the data center, recent releases of Windows Server 2012 and System Center 2012 are driving customer wins and strong renewals. Our cloud OS roadmap uniquely positions us to support the hybrid infrastructure needs of CIOs by providing one consistent platform that can span their own data center, our partners data center, or Windows Azure with ultimate flexibility, portability and scale.
On the data platform, we are growing our revenue share as enterprises continue to move mission-critical workloads to SQL Server and deploy it for their business intelligence solutions. In productivity, we are excited about the upcoming launch of the new Office, and how it redefines user experience with mobility, social and cloud features. The new Office features a fast fluid design that takes full advantage of the new Windows interface.
With Skype and Yammer integration it unlocks new experiences for communication and collaboration and brings social directly into productivity scenarios. With Windows 8, businesses will now be able to give their employees thin and light devices without compromising on security or manageability. Windows 7 momentum in the enterprise continues and today, over 60% of enterprise desktops worldwide are on Windows 7.
We've talked about Windows 8 as Windows re-imagined from the chipset to the user experience. As we undergo this transformation, it is important for us to bring the entire ecosystem along with us. With the launch in October, we collectively took the first of many steps changing the way people use technology at work and in play. Since then, the number of Windows 8 certified systems has nearly doubled. The number of apps in the Windows store has quadrupled and Windows users have downloaded over 100 million apps.
To-date, we have sold over 60 million licenses of Windows 8. Our partners, including OEM hardware manufacturers, app developers and retailers have worked hard to get us to where we are today. It’s early days and an ambitious endeavor like takes time. Together with our partners, we remain focused on fully delivering the promise of Windows 8.
As part of our work to advance the ecosystem, we launched Surface Windows RT last quarter. Surface is one part of the overall Windows 8 story. With tight integration across hardware and software, Surface highlights the unique innovation enabled by Windows 8, we launched it exclusively in our stores and in select geography and are expanding our retail and geographic footprint.
As we look forward, we strive to deliver seamless experiences across hardware, software and services. Windows 8, Windows Phone 8 and Xbox 360, provide a similar look and feel to users. This consistency complemented with our cloud services like Bing, SkyDrive, Xbox LIVE and SmartGlass unifies the consumer experience.
In the Enterprise, we continue to design and deliver world-class cloud solutions that allow our customers to move to the cloud on their own terms. The compelling experiences we deliver across our devices and services as well as our large partnering customer base uniquely positions us for sustained future growth.
In summary, this quarter strength of our product portfolio delivered record revenue and earnings per share. As we enter calendar year 2013, there is tremendous opportunity for our partners, developers and customers to leverage the capabilities and scenarios our significant product releases have enabled.
With that, I am going to hand it back to Chris to provide more details on our results.
Chris Suh
Thanks, Peter. First, I am going to review our overall results and then I'll move on to the detail by business segment.
Revenue for the quarter was up 5% to $22 billion. Operating income was $8.3 billion, up 4% and earnings per share was $0.81, also up 4%. Foreign exchange had a $200 million, or one percentage point negative impact to revenue this quarter and $154 million, or two percentage point negative impact to net income.
From a geographic perspective, we saw growth return in developed markets and saw mid-teens growth in emerging markets. Bookings were strong growing 11% as we're continuing to see customers making long-term commitments to our products. You see the results in the following metrics. Multi-year licensing revenue grew 15%. Unearned revenue grew 13% to $17.4 billion, and our contracted not billed balance was over $21 billion.
Moving to Windows. This quarter total revenue grew 11%. Within that OEM revenue outperformed underlying x86 PC market, reflecting increased demand in our distribution channel. While inventory levels ended the quarter at slightly higher levels than the prior year, we believe them to be in a healthy range given the recent launch.
Non-OEM revenue grew over 40% driven by Windows 8 upgrade, sales of Surface and double-digit growth in volume licensing. Within the x86 PC market, we saw similar trends to prior quarters with emerging market outperforming developed markets and business outperforming consumer. The Consumer segment was the most impacted by the ecosystem transition as demand exceed the limited assortment of touch devices available.
Next, I'll walk through our server and tools business, which posted another solid quarter with 9% revenue growth. Product revenue grew 9%, and within that multi-year licensing revenue grew 17%. On the strength of both, new and existing customer bookings grew a solid 15%.
For the modern data center, we continue to be on the forefront of the innovation with our Cloud OS roadmap, which provides a flexible platform for CIOs to manage their infrastructure, applications and data. With the launch of Windows Server 2012 in September, we delivered a cloud-optimized operating system and have continued to gain share in virtualization.
To further strengthen our cloud OS platform, we have introduced steady stream of innovation in Windows Azure, including virtual machines, media services, website services and mobile services. Our management product, System Center continued its momentum and delivered 18% revenue growth.
In our data platform business, SQL Server revenue grew 16% driven by strength in SQL Server premium. Revenue growth continues to outpace the market as customers increasingly use SQL Server for their mission-critical application and business intelligence needs, making it the most pervasive data platform. On the BI side, we are delivering on our strategy to enable analysis of all types of data while also accelerating time to insight. We are powering organizations to realize the power of big data as Hadoop is now compatible on Windows Server and Windows Azure. With SQL Server 2012, we took the next step forward in advancing in-memory capabilities and see tremendous opportunities ahead.
Now I will move on to the Microsoft Business Division, where revenue grew 3%. Consumer revenue declined 2% with x86 PC market dynamics being partially offset by gains in attach. Businesses are choosing Microsoft as their productivity platform for the future. This is evidenced by the healthy 18% bookings growth and near historical high renewal rates for Office. Business revenue grew 4%, and within that, multi-year licensing revenue grew 10%.
Our productivity server offerings continue to perform well, and again this quarter, Exchange, SharePoint, and Lync collectively grew double digits. Lync revenue grew at an impressive rate of 35%, as customers continue to be drawn to both the enhanced productivity that it enables, and also the economic benefits of our solution.
Next, I will move on to the Online Services Division, where revenue grew 11%. Online advertising revenue was up 15%, driven by significant search rate improvements, offset in part by a decline in display revenue. With revenue growth, and ongoing expense management, we delivered another quarter of operating performance improvement.
In the Entertainment & Devices Division, revenue declined 2%. In the important holiday season, Xbox continued its leadership position in the U.S. console market. Halo 4 launched in November, and has already become the best-selling title of the critically acclaimed gaming franchise. We did defer $380 million this quarter for games where the buyer has rights to receive content in the future. The video game deferral was included in the Q2 guidance, and we expect it to be recognized in Q3. We also continued to expand the content available in Xbox LIVE, further solidifying Xbox LIVE as the premier entertainment service in the family room.
Windows Phone saw strong growth in both phone and patent licensing revenue. In November, we launched Windows Phone 8, with our strongest lineup of both carriers and devices. Windows Phone sales were over four times higher than they were last year and at CES this year more partners were announced, as the Windows Phone ecosystem continues to grow. Skype had 138 billion minutes of calls on its network this quarter, which was up 59%.
Now I will cover the remainder of the income statement. Cost of goods sold increased 1%, due to the full quarter of Nokia platform payments, Surface and growth in cloud infrastructure, partially offset by declines in Xbox consoles. Operating expenses grew 10% to $8 billion, primarily related to marketing for product launches. This quarter, our tax rate was approximately 18%. Finally, we returned $3.5 billion to shareholders in buyback and dividends.
Now I will turn the call back over to Peter for our outlook.
Peter Klein
Thanks, Chris. Through the remainder of the call, I will discuss our expectations for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2013. Looking ahead with Windows, we know that our growth depends on our ability to give customers the exciting hardware they want, at the price-points they demand and a wider range of apps and services to meet their diverse needs.
We are hard at work with our partners to meet these goals. One of our biggest partners, Intel, not only delivered the Clover Trail chip this year, they have said they will deliver their next generation chip, Haswell, in 2013, which will enable even more advances in the device market. This is just one example of the innovation we are seeing from our chip partners.
We also need to continue to work with our hardware partners as they create thin and lightweight devices on both x86 and ARM chipsets that offer compelling touch experiences that bring Windows 8 to life. You have started to see the next wave of Windows devices at CES, and collectively we will work to ensure that we have the most compelling devices and the right mix of devices in the marketplace.
During the quarter, we launched the first device in our Surface family of products. We recently increased production and expanded distribution to third-party retail partners. Next month, we will make Surface Windows RT available in 14 additional countries.
At the same time, we will also launch Surface Windows 8 Pro, which provides the power and performance of a laptop in a tablet package. With the broadening of the Surface lineup, we will continue to highlight the power of Windows 8 tightly integrated with fantastic hardware.
On the app front, we are deepening our engagement with developers. While the number of apps in the Windows Store has quadrupled since launch, we clearly have more work to do. We need more rich, immersive apps that give users access to content that informs, entertains and inspires.
While there is a lot of work ahead of us, we are incredibly excited by the opportunities to both, broaden and enrich the Windows ecosystem. With the launch of Windows 8 and Windows RT, we are positioned for growth across a massive addressable market from tablets to laptops and Ultrabooks to all-in-ones. We will continue to work closely with our partners through this transformation as we collectively re-imagine Windows.
As you update your models remember that the Windows Upgrade Offer expires at the end of February. At that time, we will recognize $1.1 billion, which is all of the remaining deferred revenue related to the Upgrade Offer.
Within Server and Tools, product revenue, including transactional and multi-year licensing, is about 80% of the division's total revenue and enterprise services is the remaining 20%. We expect product revenue to grow low teens for the third quarter and low double digits for the full fiscal year. And we expect enterprise services to grow mid-teens for the third quarter and the full fiscal year.
In the Microsoft Business Division, multi-year licensing revenue, which is approximately 60% of the division's total, should grow low double-digits for both, the third quarter and full fiscal year. Excluding the Office deferral, transactional revenue, which is the remaining revenue in the division, should outperform the x86 PC market in the third quarter and for the full fiscal year.
As a reminder, when updating your Q3 models, we expect to recognize between $250 and $300 million of revenue related to pre-sales into the channel and the Office Offer. We expect most of the remainder of the deferral to be recognized at the expiration of the program in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013.
In the Online Services Division, we look to build upon improvements in share and search monetization. For the third quarter and full fiscal year, we expect revenue growth to be consistent with the dynamics seen in the second quarter with search revenue growth partially offset by lower display revenue.
Moving on to the Entertainment and Devices Division, in the third quarter we expect to recognize $380 million related to the video game deferral. Excluding recognition of deferrals, we expect revenue to grow high teens in the third quarter and low-single digits for the full fiscal year.
Switching to overall cost of goods sold for the company, COGS growth will continue to be impacted by the changing mix of revenue as we have seen in the past few quarters. As we look forward, excluding Surface, we expect COGS to grow high single-digits for the full fiscal year.
We are reaffirming our full fiscal year guidance for operating expenses of $30.3 billion to $30.9 billion.
Other income and expense includes dividend and interest income, offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging. In the current low interest rate environment, we expect these items to generally offset one another for the remainder of the year.
We expect our effective tax rate to be 17% to 20% for the full fiscal year, and we expect capital expenditures to be about $3.5 billion for the full fiscal year. For the third quarter, excluding the impact of deferrals, unearned revenue should roughly follow historical seasonal patterns.
In summary, we delivered solid financial results for the second quarter. We have good product momentum in the market and are excited about the opportunity to help our customers take advantage of the advancing trends in technology.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris and we’ll take some questions.
Chris Suh
Thanks, Peter. We want to get questions from as many of you as possible, so please just stick to one question and avoid long and multi-part question. Operator, please go ahead and repeat the instructions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Philip Winslow of Credit Suisse. Your line is open, sir.
Philip Winslow - Credit Suisse
Thank, guys and congrats on a good quarter in a pretty tough macro environment. Just wanted to spend a moment on Surface. You obviously talked about ramping up production and distribution of that. Just what are some of your goals as you look at Surface, RT and Pro for this year? Within that context, how should we think about the profitability of the Surface? Thanks.
Peter Klein
Thank, Phil. As we said, we think of Surface as one part of the overall Windows 8 story. Certainly this quarter it was a contributing factor to the revenue growth in Windows Business. What it does is it highlights some interesting innovation that can happen to demonstrate the power of Windows 8 when tightly integrated hardware and software and new categories of devices, and where, obviously we had some limited distribution this quarter in our stores.
As you know, we are excited about expanding that. So our goal is to continue to build that business to highlight the incredible power of Windows 8 in an interesting set of devices. We are going to expand geographically. We are going to expand the product line up. We are going to expand retail distribution and capacity. So we look forward to continuing the growth of that business.
Chris Suh
Thanks, next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citigroup. Sir, your line is open.
Walter Pritchard - Citigroup
Just wondering, Peter, if you could talk about, obviously, one of the big differences here between your devices and market and some of the competing devices I think is price point of touch machines, Windows devices, are much higher. I am wondering if you could just talk about what you learned here in the first three or four months of the Windows launch? How important price is to the customer base in terms of driving units? What do you think the outlook is in terms of getting price points down on the devices in aggregate in order to potentially drive some demand?
Peter Klein
Thanks, Walter. We have learned a lot this quarter. We learned a lot about the types of experiences and scenarios and to some extent the price points the customers are looking for from their devices. We saw some really great demand for some of the touch devices that we brought to market. In some cases, we didn’t have the supply that we needed to satisfy that demand.
From a price point, we learned what we have always suspected, which is this segmentation and differentiation. There is one of the powers in the Windows ecosystem, obviously, is the variety of devices and form factors and experiences at a variety of price points. We learned that that continues to be important.
As I said, we are working very closely with both our chip partners as well as the OEMs to bring the right mix of devices which means, to your point, the right set of touch devices at the right price point depending on the unique needs of the individual. We learned a lot about that and one of things you will see is a greater variety of devices at a bigger variety of price points that meet the differentiated needs of our consumers.
Chris Suh
Thanks, Walter. We will take the next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Rick Sherlund with Nomura. Your line is open.
Rick Sherlund - Nomura
Thank you, and Chris, welcome back to IR.
Chris Suh
Thanks, Rick.
Rick Sherlund - Nomura
MBD, I just want clarification because the revenue growth is a little slower than I would have thought but it looks like what we are seeing is a transition in the business. It looks like in business transactional, it is more multiyear licensing and the bookings growth would suggest that that business is changing to be more revenue over time versus upfront. Just want a clarification if I am thinking about that correctly.
Peter Klein
Thanks, Rick. You are thinking about that absolutely correctly. We have seen big increases in multiyear annuity business. Bookings growth was very strong. So you are seeing that transition to long-term commitment to the business.
Secondarily, this quarter obviously in a prelaunch quarter, cyclically you tend to see a slowdown in transactional business as well but that was secondary to this longer-term trend of transition to the multiyear commitment.
Chris Suh
Okay, thanks, Rick. Next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is open.
Adam Holt - Morgan Stanley
Great, thank you. Sorry to ask a model question. My question is about cash flow and I guess two factors around cash flow. Could you just drill in a little bit into the delta between bookings growth and billings growth in the quarter? Then could you also just touch on the inventory in the quarter? It looked like it was a little above what it normally is. Thank you.
Peter Klein
Well, as always there's sort of difference between bookings growth and billings growth is going to be function of the mix of long-term agreements, right? Because, our multi-year licensing agreements are three-year agreements and so bookings will include all of that revenue from the agreements and then typically those are billed a year a time, so the billings growth sort of that one-year of billings.
And, so to the extent we see this sort of growth in the multi-year licensing business, you are going to see a buildup of bookings growth is going to be fast. You are going to see a buildup of deferred revenue now move in sort of into billings and then recognition for the income statement over time. And, so to the extent we continue to see transition to long-term commitment, you will expect to see that trend continue.
Your second question was on inventory, when you say inventory, you mean on the balance sheet?
Adam Holt - Morgan Stanley
Yes.
Peter Klein
Yes. The inventory is a function of both, what's happening in the Xbox business and Surface. They are sort of offsetting impact this quarter. Some of it is from Surface and then some of it is from the Xbox business.
Adam Holt - Morgan Stanley
Terrific. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs
Great. I had a question about, Peter, you mentioned the renewal rates in MBD continue. I guess, they are at a record and continue to move higher. I am just wondering if you could share with us what's driving the increase in the renewal rates and how much runway do you have left there.
Then actually I had a follow-on Adam's question about inventory, because usually it goes down in the December quarter. Obviously, you have Surface now, so it jumped up, but did we see the traditional Xbox work down of inventory that we normally see? So, should we be looking at the fact that the delta between the drawdown that you normally see and the fact I think it went up or was roughly flat this quarter was the result of Surface?
Peter Klein
Okay. I'll start with your first question, which was MBD renewal rate, you know, I think it's a combination of things. Heather as you know over time, we've been broadening the notion of how we think about productivity and so I think it's a combination of a couple of things. One is, just the product set, Lync is a big driver, SharePoint, Exchange, so the connection between the collaboration and communications' technology and the enhancements to just the productivity applications themselves, I think Office 365 and the roadmap to the cloud is really exciting to customers and part of the reason they are making the long-term commitment to MBD and to the Office and related products, is because our roadmap to the cloud really resonates with them in how they get there over time and how that works.
I think also, our roadmap from a capability perspective and what's coming in the new Office, with social, again, advances in the cloud is really driving sort of a roadmap that's compelling to customers and so that's why they are making long-term commitments to the platform, so that's great to see. In inventory, yes, you are thinking about it right. I think we saw the normal sort of drawdown from the Xbox business in any offsetting increase there was related to Surface.
Operator
Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi. Thank you very much and happy New Year. It's already quite a bit into the year, but what I was wondering was in the holiday season post a launch for Microsoft typically we get a big effect to the PC industry. It's happened every cycle, and I guess we had some competition from tablets and we didn't quite see that kind of whiz-bang effect with a typical Windows launch.
I am curious to get your take on what is it that the media and the industry seems to have gotten it wrong? What are the misperceptions about Windows 8, and how do you think the year is going to play out as far as Windows 8 receptivity in the consumer market and business market.
Peter Klein
Yes. Thanks, Kash. Windows, as I talked about, Windows 8 is a sort of big, bold, re-imagining of Windows across the whole ecosystem, and I think this was the start of that process. I think, we all collectively learned a lot about from the user interface to the touch devices. And, as I tried to give context on the call, there's a lot of things we are working on with our partners that I think to continue to drive this process forward over the next several quarters whether it's the chipset, whether it's with developers or the kinds of applications that people want and certainly for the kinds of touch devices that they write price points that consumers want I think all of that continuously improving, we are continuously learning and happens over time, but this is a big ambitious re-imagining of Windows, and this quarter was the first step in that process.
Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. So, the traction, the ramp should get better over time and so we should not be judging the cycle for the December quarter necessarily.
Peter Klein
I highlighted the things that drive that exactly.
Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you.
Chris Suh
Thank you, Next question, please.
Operator
Brent Thill with UBS, your line is open.
Brent Thill - UBS
Peter, just on the gross margins, they have been under pressure the last several years. There is a lot of components that go in that you get to see but certainly we don’t get to see. Can you give us just the puts and takes of perhaps, is there any change later in the year, when you start to see some of the components of the COG, the expenses start to come off, or not?
Peter Klein
Well, COGS is always going to be a function of the mix of the types of revenue and so its really depend on what your underlying assumptions are about the differing components of the revenue, whether that’s hardware related revenue in Xbox and now in Surface, whether its multiyear licensing business in enterprises and what online services. So at any point in time, it's really going to depend on that mix of revenue, which is just going to cycle over time. So we try to give you some sense for the rest of the year how we see that playing out in total at Microsoft and again that’s going to be a function of the mix we see between the various components.
Chris Suh
And tend to reiterate in Peter's guidance, excluding Surface. I think Peter just high-single digits COGS for (inaudible) Surface.
Peter Klein
That’s right.
Chris Suh
Thank very much. Next question, please.
Operator
John DiFucci with JPMC, your line is open.
John DiFucci - JPMC
Thank you. Peter, you said that the Windows OEM revenue outperformed the x86 PC market and your comments imply some Windows inventory build into the channel which I believe you normally see during a quarter with a Windows launch as OEMs build inventory in preparation for the launch. Would it be accurate to assume that the Windows outperformance was primarily relative to the PC market? Was it primarily due to the inventory build or was there something else there happening? Was there anything else used to give us that bridge which you haven’t for a while now, but I just wondered if any of those other factors had a big influence?
Peter Klein
Yes, the three biggest components of the 11% total revenue growth, that 11% adjusted for the recognition of the deferrals, in the Windows business were the retail upgrades, the sales of the Surface and then multiyear licensing agreements within enterprises. To your point, there was some tailwind from inventory which was normally as you highlight what we see in the launch quarter and as Chris said, it's within the healthy range that we typically see. But that was some tailwind. But the three big impacts all up on the Windows revenue were the retail upgrades, sales of Surface and the enterprise annuity business which continues to grow double-digit.
John DiFucci - JPMC
Any detection of any piracy effects or changes?
Peter Klein
We are going to run the same long-term trend on piracy that we have always been. I wouldn't highlight anything specific to this quarter, but as always we are fighting piracy across all the dimensions and the long-term trend should be good, but that will cycle up and down in any given quarter.
Chris Suh
Thank you. Next question, please.
Operator
Colin Gillis with BGC Financials, your line is open.
Colin Gillis - BGC Financials
Hi, Peter, the trend in OSD in terms of the smaller losses. Is that a run rate that we can think about going into the March quarter? Also when you talked about the improvement in revenue per search, is there any more color or quantification you can put around that?
Peter Klein
On the first question, the guidance we gave on the revenue, we continue to work hard on the cost structure, but certainly as we highlighted the dynamics on revenue will be relatively consistent to what you see this quarter. In terms of the monetization, it's what we have been very focused on here.
Part of it is the work we have done with our partnership with Yahoo. Part of it's the quality of the searches that we have been doing. It's the realization of all the work we have been doing on both the search engine as well as the app platform to make sure it's finally tuned to deliver the best economic result and that's what we been talking about this for, gosh, a year and a half, two years. We have been really focused on that with our best talent and you start to see that paying off and that's what's driving the monetization.
Chris Suh
Thank you. Next question, please.

Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities, your line is open.
Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities
Thanks so much. Peter, you highlighted the market share gains you guys are seeing in SQL Server and specifically you talked about BI and mission-critical applications. I was just wondering if you could give us any more color on the use cases and applications where you guys are particularly seeing the biggest gains and any impact that pricing maybe having on that. Thanks.
Peter Klein
The biggest impact is the capabilities that we have delivered with SQL Server 2012. In terms of the use cases, there is couple of things that fall into those buckets of mission-critical and BI. In terms of mission-critical, we are seeing large enterprise customers re-platform on SQL for any number of things, underneath their ERP, underneath what are the major sort of LOB apps they have that sort of drive their business and that's really an emerging trend with 2012 and what that does.
That's really advance and I would add that that's been one of the drivers of our transition to multi-year licensing, because now we're seeing customers commit more and more to SQL as part of their multi-year enterprise agreements as well.
On BI side, the combination of SQL as well as SharePoint and Excel is really compelling to customers in terms of the business insights they can generate from their line of business application systems, and I think really the combination of the types what you see frontend on Excel, on top of the SQL database is really good of a driver for both businesses frankly and that's a lot of what's driving the multi-year licensing business up about MBD and FTB.
Operator
Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Company
Okay. Thank you. You had mentioned that over 60% of enterprise desktops now are running on Windows 7, looking forward how do you expect the cadence of migration activity to unfold from now until the termination of XP support in early to mid-2014. Does it continue at a similar pace for a while and at what point do we probably see this moderate?
Peter Klein
Well, the one thing I would say is not only over 60% of Windows 7, but about 90% have expressed, they have a plan to do that and so I expect to see sort of steady drumbeat between now and end-of-life for XP support in April 2014 for that to continue because the incentive is there and the express desire to do that has been expressed by our customers, so I would expect to see that continue over the next year, year-and-a-quarter.
Chris Suh
Operator, I think we have time for two more questions, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is open.
Raimo Lenschow - Barclays
Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Just to follow-on, on that one. You had one quarter Windows 8 now. What was the feedback that you had from the enterprise so far? I mean, obviously, they are still in the middle of the Windows 7 upgrade as well, but what's the point that they liked about Windows 8?
Peter Klein
Yes. There's a couple of things. They like the ability to get thin lightweight devices with the kind of security and manageability that they are used to manage their business and also there's early interest in new applications being developed with the Windows 8 interface which is a new way for their users to interact with their business applications, so I think you will see those two things are early information in driving the business interest in Windows 8.
Chris Suh
Final question, please.
Operator
Yes, sir. Last question comes from Ed Maguire with CLSA. Sir, your line is open.
Ed Maguire - CLSA
Thank you. Good evening. I wanted to follow-up on Rick's question about the transition from the transactional to a multi-year deal. How much --
Chris Suh
I think we lost the question.
Operator
I am sorry. Mr. Maguire, (Operator Instructions). Mr. Maguire, your line is open.
Ed Maguire - CLSA
Thank you. How much of your. Just going back to Rick's question, regarding the transition of transactional to multi-year revenues, what in your business reflects the transition in purchasing of on-premise to hosted or cloud offering like from Office to Office 365 or Server to Azure and other similar transitions?
Peter Klein
Well, a cloud purchase will sort of mirror multi-year annuity pressures. It's a very similar way to accomplish the same thing. You are making a long-term commitment, the revenue is going to be recognized in a similar fashion.
Today, we see a hybrid where customers are buying multi-year enterprise agreements. They'll also add-on some cloud services with that, but it will manifest itself in our financial results in a very similar way.
Chris Suh
Okay. So, that will wrap up our Q&A portion of today's earnings call. We look forward to seeing many of you at the numerous events and conferences, which we'll be participating in this quarter.
For those of you unable to attend in person, these events will generally webcast and you will be able to follow our comments at microsoft.com/investor. Please contact us if you have any additional questions or details. Thanks again for joining us. Take care.

Welcome to Microsoft’s Fiscal Year 2013 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time.
And I would now like to turn the call over to Bill Koefoed, General Manager of Investor Relations. Bill, you may begin.
Bill Koefoed
Thanks Gabrielle and thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon. As usual, with me today are Peter Klein, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel.
On our website, microsoft.com/investor is our financial summary slide deck which is intended to follow our prepared remarks and provides a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year. Unless specified otherwise, all impacted numbers for the current quarter have been adjusted for the $1.2 billion revenue deferral related to the Windows upgrade offer and Windows 8 presales to OEMs and the $189 million revenue deferral primarily related to the Office offer.
As a reminder, we will post today's prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript at the Microsoft Investor Relations website until October 18, 2013.
During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements that are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release and the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Qs and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
Okay. And with that I’ll turn the call over to Peter.
Peter Klein
Thanks Bill, and thanks everyone for joining us. Our first quarter revenue was flat year-over-year at $17.4 billion reflecting solid growth in multiyear licensing, but a slowdown in transactional revenue. Our transactional revenue which includes our OEM business was impacted by a challenging PC market, normal purchasing slowdowns in advance of upcoming product launches and tough economic conditions, particularly in Europe. This impact was offset by growth in multiyear licensing revenue which benefited from healthy renewals of enterprise agreements as customers continue to make long-term commitments to the Microsoft platform.
Our productivity and infrastructure offerings remain a top priority for CIOs. In productivity, our collaboration and communications solutions continue to perform well, with double-digit revenue growth this quarter. In the datacenter, our virtualization capabilities and hybrid cloud scenarios are enabling enterprises to move to the modern datacenter on their terms. And on the data platform, we are well positioned to take share, as customers increasingly turn to SQL Server 2012 for their mission critical workloads and business intelligence needs.
As part of our ongoing focus to increase the overall value we bring to our customers, we are enhancing our unique hybrid IT capabilities, with targeted acquisitions like StorSimple and PhoneFactor. Acquisitions of industry leading solutions like these accelerate our ability to help CIOs better manage their environment.
As I mentioned earlier, the PC market was challenged this quarter. In addition to a tough economic environment and competitive pressures, OEMs drew down their Windows 7 inventory as they began the transition to Windows 8. Our partners are building an incredible breadth of hardware. To-date, we have certified over 1,000 unique Windows 8 systems, including beautiful new tablets, convertibles, laptops and all-in-ones and there will be more to come.
As I look at where we are, we have kicked off the largest launch wave in our history and in a 12-month period, we will have refreshed nearly all of our major products. With these launches, you are seeing the investments we’ve made over a number of years converge. And more importantly, you’re seeing us execute on our commitment to deliver devices and services that people love and businesses need.
Whether we build our own devices as we have chosen to do with Xbox and Service or work with our partners to develop stunning new Windows devices. We will continue to offer consumers and businesses wide ranging choices, so that every user can get exactly what they want at the price that is right for them. 
With Windows 8 and our cloud services, we will delight users with an integrated experience across their devices. Right out of the box, Windows customers will be connected to unique communications, productivity and entertainment services from both Microsoft and our partners.
Services like SkyDrive, which allows users to store and manage their data online or the recently announced Xbox Music, which brings entertainment to the forefront. Users can access their content seamlessly from any device, at any time.
With the new Office which will be made available in the coming months, we will enable productivity scenarios to take the full advantage of the hardware coming to market. Including new mobile phone factors with touch and pen capabilities. And with Skype, Yammer and other services we put social directly into productivity and collaboration.
Within the enterprise, CIOs are using technology to drive their business strategy forward; whether it’s making employees more productive, unlocking key business insights or managing and growing number of devices, we are uniquely positioned to address their needs. Our products are scalable and flexible and provide the lowest total cost of ownership. As we enter this new era at Microsoft, there is incredible opportunity for our partners, developers and customers and we are well positioned for sustained profit growth in the future.
With those thoughts, I hand it back to Bill for more details on our results. And then I will come back to provide some thoughts on our outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2013.
Bill Koefoed
Thanks Peter. First I am going to review our overall results and then I will move on to the details by business segments. Revenue for the quarter was flat at $17.4 billion. Operating income was $6.7 billion, down 7%. Earnings per share was $0.65, a decline of 4%. Cash flow from operations was roughly flat at $8.5 billion. Foreign exchange had a $257 million or 2 percentage point negative impact to revenue this quarter, but the impact to net income was immaterial.
From a geographic perspective, this quarter we saw tough conditions in Europe where revenue declined mid-single digits. In emerging markets, PCs were roughly flat, a significant deceleration from the growth rates we had been seeing previously. Our Enterprise business in emerging markets continued double-digit revenue growth.
When looking at our revenue mix, consumer and business transactional revenue declined which is typical ahead of launches. Multiyear licensing revenue remained strong with 15% growth representing roughly 45% of our total revenue for the quarter. When adjusted for the $1.9 billion cumulative impact of the Windows and Office revenue deferrals, unearned revenue was $17.7 billion, up 13%. Our contracted-not-billed balance was roughly $20 billion.
Now let’s move onto the PC market. We saw the overall PC market decline this quarter in advance to the launch of Windows 8 and in part due to competitive pressures and the challenging macroeconomic climate, I noted earlier. Business outperformed consumer and emerging markets outpaced developed markets although at a reduced rate.
Moving to the results for the Windows division, revenue declined 9% and lagged the PC market due to OEM inventory drawdown prior to the Windows 8 launch and the ASP dynamics of emerging markets relative to develop markets.
We have discontinued the bridge to the PC market as Windows 8 will be a platform across a broad set a form factors. As we go forward we will provide updated information and metrics about our business performance in the new context.
The shape of Windows revenue this quarter was non-linear as revenue slowed down dramatically in the first two months driven by the weak PC market dynamics. Revenue accelerated in September as OEMs started to build out for Windows 8 launch demand.
Windows 8 OEM presales revenue was roughly $800 million approximately 40% higher than Windows 7 presales revenue in the comparable launch quarter. This quarter volume licensing revenue grew double-digits and our Windows 7 enterprise deployments continue to grow though at a slower rate than last quarter.
On Tuesday, we announced pricing, market availability and open to pre-orders for Surface. Next week on October 26th, we will launch Windows 8 and Surface. With a modern user interface ability to support multiple form factors and a rich platform to build apps, Windows 8 opens up significant opportunities for partners, developers and customers.
Now I will move on to the Microsoft Business divisions where revenue grew 1%. Business revenue grew 3% and within that multiyear licensing revenue grew 8%. Reflecting the PC market dynamics, consumer revenue declined 8%. Last week we released the manufacturing of the new office and announced that it will be generally available in the third quarter of fiscal year 2013. 
The new office has a fresh look and touch-friendly interface that lights up on Windows 8 devices. Since the customer preview in July millions of people have downloaded the preview or signed up for this service and we feel great about the feedback and positive response from users. The new office is also in the cloud and features social enterprise capabilities with SharePoint, [EMET] and Skype. It is our most comprehensive office release ever. 
Our productivity server offerings continue to perform well; Exchange, SharePoint and Lync collectively grew double-digit again this quarter. Lync revenue grew at an impressive rate of over 40% as enterprises chose our unified communications platform for their communication and collaboration needs. 
Dynamics revenue grew mid single-digit and within that Dynamics CRM revenue grew over 30%. This quarter we announced key milestones to our ERP portfolio, with updates to Dynamic GP and NAV. Both these releases delivered great value to customers and partners through faster and more efficient implementations and compelling application functionality. 
Now let's move to Server and Tools which posted another solid quarter with over 20% bookings growth and 8% revenue growth. Enterprises services grew 13% and multiyear licensing revenue grew 19%, driven by new customers who are investing in our product wave. Transactional revenue declined this quarter, driven in part by a slower server hardware market and customers switching to multiyear licensing.
In the datacenter, we're seeing strong adoption of our platform across Cloud, on premise and hybrid scenarios. System Center revenue grew more than 20% and we launched the Windows Server 2012 in September, with increased management and virtualization capabilities. Customers like Acer, AQUAPAX, and Volkswagen Financial Services are already using its robust set of technology and features including network virtualization, flight migration and continuous availability.
We continue to gain virtualization share as customers like [POVA] and the City of Barcelona switch from VMware to Hyper-V at System Center to build private clouds with increased efficiencies and higher savings. In the public cloud, we continued the pace innovation and announced the release preview of Windows Azure Mobile Services which connects Windows 8 apps to the cloud, backend hosted in Windows Azure.
As Peter mentioned, over the past few weeks, we announced the acquisition of StorSimple and PhoneFactor, which will enhance our position in data storage and device management. In our data platform business, SQL Server revenues continue to grow double-digit. SQL Server premium revenue grew more than 20%, as customers continue to deploy it for their mission-critical workloads and business intelligence needs.
By combining the power of SQL Server, SharePoint and Office, CIOs can create scalable, self-service BI platforms. Users can leverage these platforms to analyze and interact with data in bold new ways, make real time decisions and gain insights from big data. We’re seeing how SQL Server 2012 has raised the bar and positioned us to grow faster than the competition.
Next, I will move on to the Online Services division where revenue grew 9%. Online advertising revenue was up 15%, driven primarily by rate improvement in search offset in part by a decline in display revenue. Operating performance improved by [$150 million] or 29%. Increasingly, users are finding better search results at Bing. In (inaudible) test, nearly two and three users chose Bing’s web search results over Google’s results and over 10 million users had visited the Bing It On Challenge, where they can compare Bing and Google head-on.
In the Entertainment & Devices division, revenue declined 1%. While the console market was tough, Xbox maintained a strong share and had 49% at the US market for the quarter. This holiday season we have a great lineup of gains headlined by Forza Horizon and Halo 4, and complimented by a rich catalogue of connect games.
We continue to see strengthening Xbox LIVE, where our membership grew over 15%. This week we announced Xbox Music, which leverages the cloud to integrate the music experience across the tablet, PC, phone and TV, and has a worldwide catalogue of over 30 million songs. Xbox Music is the most comprehensive service available. It provides users unlimited streaming music on Windows devices, let’s them play music based on similar artists and styles and allows them to purchase songs and albums. 
There is no other music service out there today that matches the capabilities of Xbox Music. We are excited about the upcoming launch of Windows Phone8. We have a strong device line up and breadth of operators across key markets. We will share more about Windows Phone8 at our event on October 29.
Moving on to Skype. This quarter 120 billion minutes of calls were made on the Skype network, an increase of 58%. We continue to make progress with the integration of Skype into our portfolio of products, and have announced the upcoming federation between Lync and Skype which will allows users to access their contacts through a common interface. Skype is also central to communications in the new Office and Skype calling is included in the upcoming Office 365 subscription service.
I will now cover the remainder of the income statements and share some expectations going forward. Cost of goods sold increased 10%, primarily due to Nokia platform payments, inclusion of Skype costs, growth in cloud infrastructure and enterprise services. As we look forward, excluding Surface, we expect cogs to grow high single-digits for the full fiscal year.
Operating expenses grew 2% to $6.5 billion. For the full fiscal year, we are reaffirming our guidance for operating expenses as $30.3 billion to $30.9 billion. Other income in this quarter was $226 million driven by the gain from the MSNBC sale. Other income includes dividend and interest income offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging. In the current low interest rate environment, we expect these items to generally offset for the remainder of the year.
This quarter our tax rate was approximately 19%. For the full fiscal year, we expect our effective tax rate to be 19% to 21%. Adjusting for the impact of the Windows upgrade and Office offers, we expect other revenue will roughly follow historical sequential growth pattern for the second quarter.
We expect capital expenditures for the full fiscal year to be roughly $3.5 billion. This quarter we returned $2.9 billion to shareholders and buyback and dividend and raised the dividend 15% to $0.92 per share annually. Now I will turn it back to Peter for our revenue outlook.
Peter Klein
Thanks, Bill. For the remainder of the call, I will discuss our revenue expectations for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2013. Starting with Server & Tools, product revenue including transaction and multiyear licensing is about 80% of the division’s total revenue, and enterprise services is the remaining 20%.
As we noted the last quarter, our customers are moving from transactional purchasing to premium products and multiyear licensing agreements. We expect product revenue to grow high single-digits for the second quarter and low double-digits for the full fiscal year. And we expect enterprise services revenue to grow low double-digits for the second quarter and mid-teen for the full fiscal year.
In Microsoft business division multiyear licensing revenue which is approximately 60% of the divisions total should grow low double-digits for both the second quarter and full fiscal year. Excluding the Office deferral, transaction revenue which is the remaining revenue in the division, should grow low single-digits in the second quarter and mid single-digits for the full fiscal year. 
As a reminder, when updating your Q2 models, you should defer between $850 million and $950 million of revenue related to presales into the channel and the Office offer. Amounts deferred for presales will be recognized upon general availability, while amounts deferred to the Office offer will be recognized upon delivery, redemption or the exploration of the program in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013. 
Moving on to Entertainment and Devices division, while we have been maintaining our share and leadership position, the console market continues to be challenged. As a result, we expect revenue to decline low teens into second quarter, but to grow low single-digits with the full fiscal year. 
In the Online Services division, we look to build upon our improvements in share and search monetization. For the second quarter and full fiscal year, we expect revenue growth to be consistent with the dynamics seen in the first quarter. In the Windows division, as a reminder, second quarter growth will reflect the recognition of $800 million of revenue from first quarter presale, partially offset by roughly $100 million of additional deferred revenue related to the Windows upgrade offer. 
Remember that the upgrade offer expires at the end of February at which time we will recognize all remaining deferred revenue. Looking forward, we eagerly anticipate the launch of Windows 8. We are bringing a new range of capabilities and scenarios to Windows and with support system-on-chip architecture we are moving beyond the traditional PC to the widest range of Windows hardware we have ever seen. New hardware will debut next week and will broaden over the coming months.
With Windows 8, we are giving developers a modern platform on which they can build rich immersive apps unlike any of the Windows ecosystem have seen. The Windows Store offers developers attractive financial terms and broad reach. With its grand opening next week the Windows Store will have a strong line-up of apps. Just as with the hardware, the line-up of apps will become more robust overtime.
In addition to delivering Windows 8 next week, we will also launch Surface designed to be the ultimate stage for Windows; Surface allows users to seamlessly transition between consumption and creation and as an example of the substantial innovation that is enabled by Windows 8. We are hard at work manufacturing the devices and will ramp production overtime. October 26th only marks the beginning of the journey we will take together with our partners and developers. Our collective success will be evident overtime as we change the way people experience the power of technology.
With that, I will turn the call over to Bill and we’ll take some questions.
Bill Koefoed
Thanks Peter. And with that, Peter and I will take some questions. We want to get questions from as many of you as possible, so please stick to just one question and avoid long or multi-part questions. Gabrielle, can you please go ahead and repeat your instructions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Yes, of course. (Operator Instructions) Our first question does come from Rick Sherlund with Nomura. Your line is now open.
Rick Sherlund - Nomura
On the Windows and Windows Live division there was no real guidance for the year; you just said you would recognize all remaining deferred revenue. Can you just help us understand what the variables are that we should be thinking about other than what the PC market grows out; and by PC market, I think we need to find out as you know, all Windows 8 compatible devices including tablets. So are there mix shift issues, the price you realized on a tablet versus traditional notebook; what are kind of variables we should be thinking about in terms of how to model Windows and Windows Live revenues for the year?
Peter Klein
Yeah. That’s exactly right. One of the exciting things about Windows 8 is how it really redefines, so how people think about devices and the experiences they get across those devices and up until now, that’s sort of narrowly been defined as PCs or tablets and customers have been forced to choose and may trade-off, frankly of what they get. With Windows 8, you can kind of get whatever you want at whatever price point you want. So whether you want convertible with touch and pen and integration with your line of business apps, or do you want a tablet for great information and communications and entertainment, whether you want a touch ultrabook, all those things come into play and all those things are available with Windows 8. And I think overtime, we're going to see how that plays out and that’s the opportunity for us and it's really a factor of thinking about how all those are going to play against each other.
Bill Koefoed
Operator, next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs
Just to Rick’s question a little bit more specifically and I was on another call before this, maybe you said it. But, can you give us a sense of your expectations for Surface in the quarter, or if you can’t do that, can you give us a sense for what pre-orders were thus far, just to give us a sense of how that’s ramping out of the gate and what your expectations are there for that?
Peter Klein

Yeah, thanks Heather, right now we’re focused on our launch both of Surface and Windows 8 next week and so that’s really what we’re excited about and the opportunity to show people all the great devices, all the great capabilities and so we’re not talking about that now. As we mentioned on the call, we’re working hard on production, we’re ramping production, we’re excited about what we’ve heard so far, the feedbacks are great, the reviews have been really good. And I think that demonstrates what we’ve been talking about, the capabilities and experiences that Windows 8 delivers across various form factors. Operator, next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Adam Holt - Morgan Stanley
I am going to shift to the Server and Tools business; the billings were a little bit better than we thought, but the recognized revenue in the forward guide was a little bit lighter than we have been looking for. And I just want to drill in to some of the expectations for the forward guidance. Are you assuming the transactional environment remains weak? Do you still think you can outpace the transactional piece in terms of your business and what should we be thinking about in terms of the convergence of billings and recognize revenue? Thank you.
Peter Klein
Yeah, thanks Adam; what we are continuing to see is that a migration from transactional revenue to multiyear licensing agreements, which is great, because it’s one of the things that’s driving the business, which is the vision we have for the roadmap, the resonance that has with our customers and so they’re making long-term commitments to the platform. And so, it’s one of the reasons we gave you the bookings number and the multiyear licensing revenue number of 20% and 19%, because that’s what you’re seeing and so as that’s growing faster than the transactional you’ll see the bookings and the backlog grow and the recognize will follow overtime.
So that’s really the thing to watch for in Server and Tools and we continue to be very bullish on that opportunity across the board whether that’s to Window server, system center what we are doing in the private cloud and public cloud and certainly with SQL Server. So that trend that we are seeing in the migration to the multiyear licensing agreements is driving that business both now and for the long-term.
Bill Koefoed

And just to build on that, this is one of the strongest bookings quarters we’ve had in the last several years, so again for a $19 billion business to have over 20% bookings growth we feel obviously in addition to all the products that have come so far this year I think we feel pretty excited about the opportunity in that business. So thanks for asking that question. Gabrielle, next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now open.
Mark Moerdler - Sanford Bernstein
So question, given the slowdown in the PCs, how should we think about the change or what’s going on in the Windows adoption processes; are we seeing continuation at the current rate or is this some proportional slowdown in the roll out of Windows 7?
Peter Klein

We continue to see -- you are talking about enterprise adoption?
Mark Moerdler - Sanford Bernstein
Right.
Peter Klein
We continue to see that grow this quarter although at a slower rate than we had in past quarters, so that opportunity remains very large. We are over 50% deployed and remember the end-of-life for XP is about a year and half away, so that remains a great opportunity for us that we see continuing on.
Mark Moerdler - Sanford Bernstein
But it is slowing a bit?
Peter Klein

It did this quarter.
Bill Koefoed

It did yeah just this quarter and it’s a summer quarter, so I don’t know that I would read too much into just one period. Gabrielle, next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citi. Your line is now open.
Walter Pritchard - Citi
Just to follow on with some launch questions, so there are sort of two changes here to the business that we will see going forward, one is the hardware piece in Windows and the other is, what looks like a pretty big ramp-up on the retail side with some store presence; understanding that the latter is probably in your guidance. Can you just remind us on the store side, where are you allocating the expenses and is that presence potentially grows overtime; how you expect that to the impact your financials? And then on Surface, should it be anything we think about other than sort of a price time to unit and making margin assumption, are there any other new ones around, the way you account for Surface in your financials?
Peter Klein
First question was about the retail stores and were they showing up…
Walter Pritchard - Citi
Yeah, where the expenses are?
Peter Klein
Got it. The expenses are [incorp] and they show up a little bit in COGS and a little bit in operating expenses.
Bill Koefoed
And sorry, what was the second part of your question?
Walter Pritchard - Citi
To on Surface, I mean is there anything else, we should be thinking about in terms of how to model the impact of Surface; we know the price, we can make a unit assumption, we can make a margin assumption. Is there any deferrals, any OpEx impact and warranty you know…..?
Peter Klein
Yeah, you’re thinking about it right.
Bill Koefoed
Gabrielle, next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch
As you enter the world of the new form factors; since you’re coming little bit behind relative to Apple, what is the right way to think about your differentiation relative to the consumer market, opportunity for tablets and the enterprise market opportunity for tablets? Thank you.
Peter Klein
Well, I think one of our differentiations is we give everybody what they want for the purpose they want it. When I talk to CIOs for example and the enterprises, one of the things they really excited about is that Windows 8 devices give them a chance for their employees that uses that technology to have the devices they want and bring to work, they get the kind of manageability, security, integration to go on in business apps they want. So I think there is a big differentiation in the enterprise across all the form factors especially tablets that that are increasingly coming in for a place.
On the consumer side, I think there not only a range of price points and different kinds of form factors, but also unique and differentiated set of services and experiences that come with the device including Office, including SkyDrive, including Xbox Music. So I think across the board we see similar differentiation both in the enterprise and on the consumer.
Operator
Our next question comes from Brent Thill with UBS.
Brent Thill - UBS
Peter if Surface is successful, shouldn’t the cogs be well above the high single-digit growth for the fiscal year. I was just curious why you excluded, are you just waiting to see how the traction is before you give us more guidance or what is the explanation for that?
Peter Klein
Yeah, that's exactly right (inaudible).
Operator
Our next question comes from John DiFucci with JPM.
John DiFucci - JPM
I have a question on the deferred revenue specifically for the Windows business. Even if you exclude the adjustments, deferred revenue for this business increased in the quarter. And you normally or actually you always see a seasonal decline. I guess can you talk a little bit about that. What are we seeing there, is this tied to multi-year deals in this business now or is there something you do, or some of these adjustments maybe we are not accounting for correctly.
Peter Klein
It actually is that its multiyear licensing deals is continuing to grow double-digits so that’s what’s driving the deferred there. That's one sort of example of how enterprises are continuing to see value and adopting Windows.
Operator
Our next question comes from Colin Gillis with BGC Financials.

Looking at the Server and Tools line again, when the results first printed we were asked quite a bit if that was showing any weakness in the enterprise [spend] environment. It sounds like a lot of that was just driven by the rotation to multiple year contracts. But can you talk about the market place right now, and if the market place is weakening, do you find out to be an advantage given the cost preferences in that line?
Peter Klein
It definitely is the migration from transaction licensing. Irrespective of a weak market, strong market, we’ve got a great value, and it does play very well in tough macroeconomic times, because one of our great value proposition is the savings and efficiencies people get from using integrated technology across their stack at a really good price performance characteristic. 
So I would say, we feel great about our value proposition in any environment, does play very well in a tough macro environment. But what we're seeing now in the financials this is how we highlight bookings growth and multi-year licensing growth. It’s related more towards the migration from the transactional business.
Operator
Okay, our next question comes from Philip Winslow of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Philip Winslow - Credit Suisse
Alright, thanks guys. Just have a question on just the margins of Surface, kind of the high level doing in an exact margin percentage. But how did you get sort of price Surface relative to (inaudible). I mean, obviously you guys talked about this one including implied your revenue amount for Windows license. Did you also take in to account sort of a weighted average or [tax] rate of Office for the buyers and then you add on a gross margin for the hardware. Just kind of how you built up to that, and then just kind of a high level, what was the pricing thoughts behind service. Was it the drivers, just adoption of the platform, was it actually may be some business, and does it change at all, near-term versus longer term? Thanks.
Peter Klein
As a [ready] pricing decision, it’s really about the value proposition effort through your customers and the degree of capabilities and value you are delivering to them at a variety of price points for what they want. And that’s really fundamentally what drives all of our pricing decisions. Do we have a really compelling value to offer our customers with the capabilities that we’re delivering, and that’s what we do across all our business and that’s what drives our economic performance.
Operator
And our next question comes from Ed Maguire with CLSA. Your line is now open.
Ed Maguire - CLSA
Looking at how you’re beginning to combine products and services with Office 365 for home and then, the bundling of services with Windows RT. Looking forward, is this going to change the way that you allocate, what might have been transactional revenues in the past to accommodate those transactional and services revenues?
Peter Klein
Yeah, generally that is correct. As we move to more delivery at services that will show up as services revenue as oppose to transactional revenue, that’s correct. But I do think, it’s a long-term trend and you saw that in the commentary that we made around our server and tools business. But we are having people that are making longer term commitments to Microsoft, and that shows up in our annuity business and server, it shows up in things like Office 365 where people are having a subscription service, it shows up in things like Xbox LIVE which you’ve seen happening over the last couple of years. So, Ed, I think you’ve got it right that we’re seeing a lot more people that are committing to a longer term relationship with Microsoft which is clearly what we’re striving toward.
Operator
Okay. Our next question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is now open.
Brad Reback - Stifel Nicolaus
Peter, historically the transactional aspect of MBD has followed the PC market roughly. Is there any reason to think that that’s not the case here for the final three quarters?
Peter Klein
Yeah, in general there are two things that impact the transactional business at MBD, one is PC market and the other is product cycle. So one of the things we also see period right before a launch of a new product from a transactional side and businesses is a slowdown, and also it does track the PC market. So those are the two things to keep an eye on. 
Operator
Alright. Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Raimo Lenschow - Barclays
Historically when we had to launch a Windows product there was a big uptake especially on the consumer side. Now this time around it’s obviously different from the factors that are playing in and consumers need to get used to it. How do you think about the momentum we should see in terms of the first quarter or the second quarter etcetera? Thank you.
Peter Klein
Well without giving specific [items] we are certainly very excited about the capabilities that come with Windows 8 and the excitement that comes from that, and we are excited to talk about that at the launch next week. I think I am encouraged by what we saw from the Windows 8 selling that we’ve seen so far the 40% growth over the comparable period last time. So we will just keep an eye on that and watch as we get further into the launch.
Operator
Alright our final question comes from Greg Moskowitz with Cowen. Your line is now open.
Greg Moskowitz - Cowen
This is somewhat of a follow up t Raimo’s question. Over the past several months many of those reviewing Windows 8 for PCs while praising the significant innovation behind the OS have also continued to focus on the dual interfaces and the adjustment that users will have to make. Is that something that causes you concern just when it comes to initial adoption levels of Windows 8. Just wondering how you think about that?
Peter Klein
Not a lot, I hear the feedback and as a user we sort of have gotten used to it very quickly. At Microsoft when we do an innovation historically across our products often times there is new things that comes and I understand initially people do look at those things. And what we see overtime is that those innovations have delivered way more value, way more productivity and way more better usability. And so I am very confidence that is even more true with the great technology and capabilities and experiences that we have at Windows 8.
Bill Koefoed
And I think you have seen that the use of people who have used it over a longer period of time. And again for those who will be helpfully using it early. You will see that shopping your experience as well. Okay, so that’s going to wrap up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. We look forward to seeing many of you at the numerous events and conferences in which we will be participating in this quarter. For those of you unable to attend and personally, these events will generally be webcast and you will be able to follow along at microsoft.com/investor.

Welcome to Microsoft's Fiscal Year 2012 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Bill Koefoed, General Manager of Investor Relations. Bill, you may begin.
Bill Koefoed
Thanks, Sharon, and thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon. As usual, with me today are Peter Klein, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel. On our website, microsoft.com/investor, is our financial summary slide deck which is intended to follow our prepared remarks and provides a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year. Unless specified otherwise, all impacted numbers for the current quarter have been adjusted for the $540 million revenue deferral related to the Windows upgrade offer and the previously announced $6.2 billion goodwill impairment charge.
As a reminder, we will post today's prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript at the Microsoft Investor Relations website until July 19, 2013.
During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements that are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release and the comments made during this conference call and in the risk factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
And with that I’ll turn the call over to Peter.
Peter Klein
Thank, Bill, and thanks everyone for joining us. We started the fiscal year with good momentum and closed with a solid finish. Throughout the year we delivered top line growth and remained disciplined on cost management while continuing to execute on our product roadmap. Our enterprise products and services remain a top priority for CIOs as they navigate macroeconomic challenges. They are adopting our solutions for increased productivity, manageability, and security at an overall lower total cost of ownership.
Windows 7 and Office 2010 both reached new milestones as enterprises benefit from our business desktop offerings. Today over 50% of enterprise desktops worldwide are running Windows 7 and software assurance attach rates are at an all-time high. And even two years after launch, Office 2010 attach continues to grow as businesses make long-term commitments to the Office platform. Our productivity server offerings continue to perform very well with double-digit growth. Our newest server offering, Lync, grew over 45% this quarter, and we are excited about the unified communication scenarios that are enabled by new voice, video and social capabilities.
Office remains the number one productivity application and today is on more than 1 billion PCs worldwide. On Monday we released a customer preview of the new Office, which puts mobility, social and cloud at the forefront. Combined with the power of Windows 8, we are enabling a new platform of computing that gives the end-user unparalleled choice for consumption and productivity.
Our Server & Tools products deliver on the vision of the modern data center by enabling multi-tenancy, scalability and continuous services, all while using a single pane of glass for management. No other technology company can offer the hybrid cloud solutions that give customers the ability to manage and scale their applications, data and processes across both public and private clouds.
As I look back when I first became CFO of Server & Tools in 2003, it was a $7 billion business. Since then it has grown to nearly $19 billion in revenue and the opportunity for future growth has never been better.
Xbox continued its evolution as an entertainment platform and has solidified its place in the living room. With the help of Kinect and Bing, discovering and accessing content has never been easier. And with the recently announced Xbox SmartGlass, we look to make entertainment smarter, more interactive and more fun.
Moving to the Online Services Division, we continue to grow share, increase revenue per search and improve operating performance. Despite this progress, our expectations for future growth and profitability are now lower than we previously expected. As we announced earlier this month, we took a write-down on the goodwill that arose mainly from the aQuantive acquisition. We continue to believe that search is a strategic asset for Microsoft and are prioritizing our resources into the areas we believe drive the most business value.
With Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8, we see a great opportunity to benefit from the trend towards smart mobile devices. We feel that we are uniquely positioned to address the security and manageability challenges that CIOs are dealing with today as a result of this trend. And for users, we offer compelling experiences across devices with data and services that are connected seamlessly via the cloud.
In summary, we delivered solid financial results while embarking on the largest launch wave in our history. We are pleased with the long-term commitment that enterprise customers are making to our offerings as it demonstrates the high level of confidence in our product and service roadmap. Importantly, customer satisfaction is at an all time high. This past year we delivered significant product releases such as SQL Server 2012, System Center 2012, and updates from Azure, Bing, and Xbox LIVE, and enthusiasm is building for the coming year that includes important releases from Windows, Windows Phone, Office and Windows Server.
With those thoughts, I will hand it back to Bill to provide more details on our results, and then I will come back to provide some thoughts on our outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2013.
Bill Koefoed
Thanks, Peter. First, I'm going to review our overall results and then I'll move on to the details by business segment. Revenue for the quarter was $18.6 billion, up 7% or $1.2 billion. Operating income was $6.9 billion, up 12%. Earnings per share was $0.73, up 6%. Cash flow from operations was $7.7 billion, up 29%, and for the full year it was a record $31.6 billion. Foreign exchange did not materially impact our net income this quarter.
From a geographic perspective, developed markets grew mid-single digits and we saw continued double-digit growth in emerging markets. We delivered solid financial results despite a tough economic environment which demonstrates the strength and breadth of our businesses. Our compelling product portfolio across Windows Server and Tools in the Microsoft Business Division is driving strong demand from small businesses to the largest global enterprises. Multi-year licensing revenue grew 14% and made up over 40% of our total revenue for the quarter. Unearned revenue was a record $19.5 billion, up 14% and our contracted-not-billed balance was over $19.5 billion.
Turning to the PC market, we estimate that the worldwide PC market was roughly flat this quarter with approximately 85 million PCs sold. Business PCs were up 1% and consumer PCs were down 2%. Next, I'll move on to the results for the Windows & Windows Live Division, where revenue was generally in line with the PC market. As in past quarters, you will find the OEM revenue bridge in our earnings slide deck.
Adoption of Windows 7 remained strong especially among enterprises, which are benefiting from the security and management capabilities that come with the operating system. This quarter volume licensing revenue grew double-digits. During the quarter, we launched the release preview of Windows 8 to a positive reception, and we recently announced that Windows 8 will reach general availability on October 26. Windows 8 represents a significant opportunity for developers, OEMs and other partners to extend a new range of form factors, capabilities and scenarios to billions of people around the world.
Now, I'll move on to the Microsoft Business Division where revenue grew 7%. Business revenue grew 9% and within that, multi-year licensing revenue grew 12% and transactional revenue grew 2% driven by higher attach worldwide. Consumer revenue declined 4% reflecting consumer PC dynamics in developed markets which was partially offset by higher attach rates. We saw strong growth in our productivity server offerings with Exchange, SharePoint and Lync collectively growing double-digits this quarter.
CIOs continue to invest in our application roadmap and new productivity scenarios. As Peter mentioned, Lync revenue growth accelerated to over 45% as enterprises chose our unified communications platform. We believe unified communications is a huge market opportunity and we are pleased to see these results.
Just a year ago we introduced Office 365. It is now offered in 88 markets and 32 languages. In just one year some of the biggest global brands have embraced Office 365 to share information and connect with customers and partners. Global brands such as Lowe’s, Qantas, Japan Airlines and Hallmark Cards have adopted Office 365 to unify their communication and collaboration experience with a secure trusted platform.
Earlier this week we released the customer preview of the next version of Office. It features an intuitive design that works great on Windows 8 with touch, stylus, mouse or keyboard. It is available as a cloud-based subscription service and includes Skype credits and extra SkyDrive storage. With SkyDrive integration, content is always available across all types of devices.
It enables modern scenarios such as digital note taking, reading and markup. It is social and makes it easier to connect with people and information. With People Card, there is an integrated view of contacts from LinkedIn and Facebook. And speaking of social, this morning we announced that we have closed the Yammer acquisition. The Yammer adds best-in-class enterprise social networking to our portfolio of cloud-based productivity services.
Dynamics revenue grew 7% and within that Dynamic CRM revenue grew over 25% and added 360,000 users this quarter. We now have more than 2.7 million users and 36,000 customers that use Dynamic CRM to get a consistent and familiar experience inside Office.
Now let's move to Server & Tools which posted another solid quarter with 13% revenue growth; transactional revenue declined low-single digits while multi-year licensing revenue grew more than 20%, fueled by the wave of our new server products. Enterprise services grew 15%.
In the private cloud, Windows Server Premium revenue grew double-digits. With greater scalability, improved performance and cost efficiencies, Hyper-V continues to win share against VMware. In anticipation of what is coming in Windows Server 2012, we are already seeing customers like Unilever move from VMware to Hyper-V. System Center revenue grew roughly 20% and we continued building momentum and demand for our private cloud capabilities. With the release of System Center 2012 and our leadership in Windows Server Active Directory, we have a compelling device management and application delivery platform.
In the public cloud we launched a major release of Windows Azure, which enables infrastructure-as-a-service capabilities, adds 48 countries, offers media services, and brings new capabilities to developers. We are excited that Windows Azure Media Services is being used to deliver Olympics coverage in high-definition. This quarter Windows Azure had significant customer and partner wins and we added roughly 800 new enterprise customers.
In our data platform business, SQL Server revenue grew 20% outpacing industry growth. Every week, we see customers moving to SQL Server because of its superior business analytic, security, flexibility and cost-effectiveness. SQL Server Premium revenue grew more than 30% as enterprises continued to deploy it for their mission critical workloads and business intelligence needs.
High-performance and BI capabilities offered by SQL Server 2012 along with Hadoop integration will enable our customers to capture the full potential of Big Data. As I look back at the year, SQL Server revenue grew more than $0.5 billion, and with the technology advancements in SQL Server 2012, we are well positioned for future growth.
Next, I will move on to the Online Services Division where revenue grew 8% and operating performance improved by $266 million or 36%. Online advertising revenue was up 12% driven primarily by rate improvement in our search business. Bing’s U.S. organic market share ended the quarter at 15.6%, up 120 basis points year-over-year.
In the Entertainment & Devices Division, revenue grew 20%. Despite the soft console market, Xbox continues its leadership position and has 47% share of the U.S. market in June. Additionally, Xbox LIVE membership increased by more than 15%, driven in part by the new content partners we had brought to Xbox. We also announced Xbox SmartGlass which will connect phones, PCs and tablets with the Xbox 360 console to enable more interactive and engaging entertainment.
For Windows Phone, there are now approximately 100,000 apps in the marketplace and Windows Phone unit sales grew more than 50% sequentially. In June, we announced that Windows Phone 8 will arrive later this year. Windows Phone 8 is based on the same core technologies that power Windows 8 and it will unleash a new wave of features for consumers, developers and businesses.
Moving on to Skype. We continue to progress with the integration and you got a taste of that with our office announcement this week. This quarter 115 billion minutes of calls were made on the Skype network, an increase of over 50% from the prior year.
I will now cover the remainder of the income statement. Costs of goods sold increased 12% primarily due to Nokia platform payments, inclusion of Skype costs, and growth in enterprise services. Operating expenses were flat at $7.5 billion. Operating income increased 12% to $6.9 billion. This quarter, we returned $2.7 billion to shareholders in buybacks and dividends.
So to wrap up, we saw a strong demand from our business customers leading to solid financial results. Along with our revenue growth, we were able to maintain strong cost discipline and drive operating margin expansion.
And with that, I will hand it back to Peter, who is going to discuss our business outlook.
Peter Klein
Thanks, Bill. For the remainder of the call, I'll discuss our expectations for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2013. As we look forward, we expect many of the trends from 2012 to continue. Companies will prioritize the transition to the modern desktop. CIOs will continue to invest in cloud solutions to deliver productivity, scalability to their business. Consumers will increasingly leverage cloud services to ensure their content is always available across any of their devices. Rapid innovation will continue in hardware, services and the underlying infrastructure that is needed to support mobile computing. With our current portfolio and roadmap we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on these trends.
Now turning to our outlook by business. For Windows, in the first quarter we expect to defer $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion related to the Windows upgrade offer and presales of Windows 8 to OEMs prior to general availability. Just a reminder that amounts deferred for the Windows upgrade offer will get recognized upon the earlier of redemption or the expiration of the program on February 28, 2013.
We expect the current dynamics of the PC marketplace to continue in the first quarter. Excluding the impact of the deferrals associated with the Windows Upgrade Offer and pre-sales, we expect Windows revenue to slightly trail the PC market for the quarter. 
With new touch-enabled features in Windows 8 and new form factors hitting the market this fall, we expect Windows 8 to drive the PC ecosystem forward. Excluding the deferrals from fiscal year 2012, for the year we expect Windows revenue to be roughly in line with the PC market. Note that this does not include the impact of Surface PCs which we will update you on in the coming months. 
In the Microsoft Business Division, multi-year licensing revenue, which is approximately 60% of the division’s total, should grow low double-digits for both the first quarter and full-year. Transactional revenue, which is the remaining revenue in the division, should lag the overall PC market until the launch of Office due to the normal cyclical slowdown in advance of the next version, and then slightly outperform the PC market post-launch.
Within Server and Tools, our customers are moving from transactional licensing into multi-year licensing agreements. This impacts our mix of revenue, and for next year we expect multi-year licensing to be approximately 60% of the division’s revenue, transactional licensing to be 20%, and Enterprise Services to remain at 20%.
With the shift to multi-year agreements, we expect transactional revenue to slightly lag the overall server hardware market for the first quarter and full-year. For both the first quarter and the year, we expect multi-year licensing revenue and Enterprise Services revenue to both grow low-teens.
In the Online Services Division, we look to build upon improvements in share and search monetization, with focused investment in the highest value areas.
For our Entertainment and Devices Division, while we have been maintaining our share leadership position, the console market has been showing year-over-year declines. For games, Halo 4 will launch in Q2, while Gears of War was a Q1 title last year. With these considerations in mind, we expect revenue to decline high-teens in the first quarter, and to be roughly flat for the full-year. 
We expect COGS to grow high-single digits in the first quarter, due primarily to the Nokia payments, addition of Skype and growth in Enterprise Services, partially offset by lower console volumes.
We are reaffirming our guidance for operating expenses of 30.3 to $30.9 billion for fiscal 2013, and as you create your models, you should expect higher expense growth rates around the timing of launches.
As a reminder, Other Income includes dividend and interest income, offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging. In the current low interest rate environment, we expect these items to generally offset, absent one-time events.
For the full fiscal year, we expect our effective tax rate to be 19% to 21%, and capital expenditures to be slightly over $3 billion. 
Adjusting for the impact of the Windows Upgrade Offer and pre-sales, we expect unearned revenue will roughly follow historical sequential growth patterns for the first quarter.
In summary, we delivered solid financial results in both the fourth quarter and for the full fiscal year. We enter fiscal 2013 with great momentum and are excited about our upcoming launches.
And with that I’ll turn the call over to Bill, and we will take some questions.
Bill Koefoed
Thanks Peter. We want to get the questions from as many of you as possible, so please stick to just one question and avoid long or multi part questions. Sharon, can you please go ahead and repeat your instructions.
Question-and-Answer Session 

Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. 
Adam Holt - Morgan Stanley

In past Windows cycles, commercial and retail licensing and inventory rebuild have enabled you to outpace the PC market, how should we think about those factors around Windows 8, and are you including OEM related tablet sales in your PC market forecast for next year or should we be excluding those like Surface. Thank you.
Peter Klein
Well the first question I will go back to the guidance we gave for how we expect Windows to really ignite the PC market and how we (inaudible) to do relative to the PC market. Obviously, we said it was going to lag a little bit in the first quarter prelaunch and for the full-year, would be roughly in line, so obviously that means for the remainder of the year slightly ahead. And also think about some of our emerging markets versus developed markets and what that means for the overall growth of Windows relative to the hardware market. On the second question on the PC market, I’d say when we talk about the PC market we are largely consistent with how the third parties would report on the PC market traditionally.
Operator
Next we have Rick Sherlund with Nomura. Your line is open.
Rick Sherlund - Nomura
On Office 365, I’m kind of curious how we should be thinking about how that revenue ramps up. You haven’t really talked much yet about the availability of Office 365. I know it's included with the WinRT, should we expect then that it's broadly available in the market with October 26th launch date of Windows 8?
Bill Koefoed
I think generally you're characterizing it correctly. We were really excited about the new Office and what that means for Office 365 being broadly available for both consumers and enterprises, and we do think this is a real accelerant for the business. Today, it's been a really compelling part of the overall Office story. We talk with every customer about the cloud roadmap, and that’s one of the drivers of what we're seeing broadly across MBD, not just in Office, but in SharePoint, Lync and Exchange. And I think you’re thinking about this right that when we get to the new Office in conjunction with Windows 8 we really accelerate what we are doing for both consumers as well as businesses of all sizes.
Operator
Next we have Mark Moerdler from Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.
Mark Moerdler - Sanford Bernstein
Yahoo! in their earnings call on Tuesday reported that the revenue per search they are getting from Microsoft is below the Microsoft guarantee threshold and that the guarantee expires Q1 2013 I guess, Q1 2013. CFO alluded to a clause in the search agreement because Yahoo! went out that there is no parity, first, is this correct? And second, what if any impact would this have on the search strategy if they decided to break this agreement?
Peter Klein
What I’ll tell you Mark we are sort of laser-beam focused on the partnership that we have with Yahoo! We’ve be very encouraged with the year-over-year improvements we have seen over the last several quarters. And to be honest 100% of our focus right now is on making sure we continue to drive those gains which will benefit both parties of the partnership and make sure that’s successful for both companies because it’s obviously very strategic for both of us.
Operator
Next question is from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs
Peter, you mentioned on the call the increase in Server and Tools multi-year licensing revenue as a percentage of the total segment. I was wondering if you could walk us through kind of what the biggest drivers are behind that and should we expect kind of the trajectory you are seeing here to continue?
Peter Klein
The biggest piece of that we are seeing is SQL and we are getting so much great traction with big enterprises really starting to make progress in tier 1 applications and what we are seeing now is many more long-term multi-year agreements for SQL, which used to be more of a transactional business, but now as bigger companies are making their commitment to our data platform, putting their mission-critical applications on it, they are signing more of a new kind of licensing that we had just for SQL for multi-year licensing agreements. So by far the biggest impact is in SQL, and yes with the new version of SQL Server 2012 we expect that to continue.
Bill Koefoed
Just to add on I mentioned in my script that year-over-year revenue for SQL was up over $0.5 billion. So, just awesome momentum in SQL in the database business and our competitive strategy in the marketplace has just really been playing out.
Operator
Next we have Walter Pritchard of Citigroup. Your line is open.
Walter Pritchard - Citigroup
I wanted to just ask a follow-up or ask a question on the contracted backlog. I know we are accustomed to looking at that with the unearned number. But it looks like that number, if I look at the sequential trend there it was a little wide of what we have seen on similar Q4s where you have seen a more robust quarter-over-quarter growth. I’m just wondering, was there something about the shape of the enterprise annuity business or what you saw in the quarter that caused that?
Peter Klein
No, as you pointed out, we tend to look at it all up on our annuity business, both contracted as well as the unearned and taken as a whole. We’re obviously very pleased with what we are doing. We’re pleased with the performance we’ve had with our customers, we’re pleased with the renewal rates, we’re pleased with the trend that we just talked about with SQL. I wouldn’t highlight anything unusual there.
Bill Koefoed
I’d just add on that our enterprise agreement renewal rate was certainly within if not at the higher end of our historical range. So, we feel really good about the execution of the sales force this quarter and I think that that definitely played out towards the end of the fiscal year.
Operator
Next we have Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse
Just want to focus go back on the EDD division, you talked about relatively flattish revenue. You gave a lot of color on your mix in terms of the revenue contributions there. But when you think about the operating expenses and the profitability of that business, what would you expect this coming fiscal year and this point in the cycle?
Peter Klein
When I think about E&D, I feel really good about the evolution of the business model for the entertainment business, you have seen us really add the content partners that we have and grow the Xbox LIVE business. And so historically the profitability has been largely sensitive to the console market and that’s still a big piece of it, but as we broadened our business, we now are at different revenue streams. And obviously the other thing I’d say is with Halo 4 coming later this year, having a really high first-party title is always a great thing from a profit perspective. So, when you think about the business model going forward, I feel great about some of the content is coming. I feel great about the subscription with Xbox LIVE and some of the access and discoverability we have with Kinect and Bing as well.
Operator
Next we have Brent Thill with UBS. Your line is open.
Brent Thill - UBS
Peter you had really strong multi-year operating margin improvement in the Server business and I was just curious if you could give us a sense of what you are seeing that’s causing that and how should we think about that going forward in terms of that trajectory?
Peter Klein
As that business has really accelerated and shown great revenue growth. We are obviously getting the benefits of the scale that you get right, because a lot of the expenses are R&D expense and so, we’ve really been able to improve those margins at the same that we have been building out, both the public and private cloud assets as well. And you heard me talk about before, we’re really encouraged by the trajectory of that business and we think there is continued headroom from that perspective.
Bill Koefoed
I’d just add on, I think as when (inaudible) spoke at one of the conferences this past year, I think he just talked about the fact that our roadmap there is something that enterprises are really buying into because, I mean use this term hybrid cloud and he talked about, this as a strategy of working with enterprises to focus on their on-premise capability, as well as their public cloud capability and being able to offer the opportunity for people to kind of manage that interchangeably. And we really feel like we’ve got just a unique set of capabilities there, and as Peter said, we’ve been making a lot of investment there and you are really seeing that show up in our revenue growth.

Next we have Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. 
Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch
Is the PC market, if you were to include the Windows OEM tablet, as well, Windows tablet really grow faster than conventional PCs. Would you be able to stick to your comment that Windows revenue would grow in line with the PC market?
Bill Koefoed
Let me take that. So, I mean I think Peter talked about this just a second ago, but there is just a whole bunch of kind of moving pieces in there. He talked about there is emerging markets that are growing faster than developed markets. Obviously, there is a different pricing, we have different prices in emerging markets than we do in developed markets. Obviously, there is also some upgrade revenue that we’d be recognizing during this year. I think Kash to your point, there could be some tablet growth. I mean to be honest, it could grow faster but at the same time these best estimates that we have is that we’re going to grow in line with all the information that we have available.
Operator
Next we have John DiFucci with JPMorgan. Your line is open. 
John DiFucci - JPMorgan
My question has to do with the Server and Tools business. I guess when I back into what the transactional business is, I guess the question is did it decline this quarter, and when I look at the guidance you are giving. Peter, why would the transactional business slightly lag the hardware market? I think that sort of implies that you are losing share now? I think that that's what’s happening out there. Can you help me a little bit with this?
Peter Klein
You are right. It's not losing share, but it's transitioning to the multi-year licensing business for both Windows Server and SQL Server. So that's really what we are seeing, and Bill gave you some of the numbers when he was talking about some of the growth in SQL Server revenue and just all-out multi-year licensing business for the Server & Tools business. It's really just a mix to the multi-year agreements which we love, because it’s people making longer-term commitments to the platform.
John DiFucci - JPMorgan
So these are people that had been buying transactional that are moving to multi-year, because it sounded a little bit like they were large enterprises that might have been shifting and buying more Windows than they would have brought other stuff in the past?
Peter Klein
In general, in total when people are buying new Server & Tools products, they are more often going to multiyear licensing agreements than transaction where that wasn’t as much the case in the past.
Operator
Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest. Your line is open. 
Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest
You mentioned that in SQL Server 2012, you’re going to have Hadoop support. I was wondering if you could give us anymore details on what you are planning there and what we might look for in terms of functionality that's going to be enhanced with the Hadoop support edition?
Bill Koefoed
Brendan, neither Peter and I are probably technically savvy enough to be able to offer a great answer on that one, but we are happy to get somebody from the Server & Tools business who can go deep on the technology and we’d love to talk about what we are doing around that and certainly arrange a follow-up call with you in the future if so. Thanks for the question and we’ll follow-up with you.
Operator
Raimo Lenschow with Barclays Capital. Your line is open. 
Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital
Going back to Adam’s question at the beginning, if you think about the timing of the Windows 8 launch and the impact it has on the financials, is there anything that we should think differently this time given that you have like new form factors, the tablets are coming in, your OEM partners still need to come up. So, if you try to model this financial impact, do we need to be aware of a slight delay there compared to previous cycles?
Peter Klein
Well, I’d refer you to the guidance that I gave when we look forward and the general answer would be like in previous launches we are incredibly excited about their capabilities, probably more excited about what we are doing with Windows 8 and reimagining what you can do with Windows. And in particular what we are doing and what our OEM partners are doing to deliver really cool devices and really exciting form factors. So, the general answer is, no we are probably more excited about this launch than any launch in a long time.
Operator
Colin Gillis with BGC Financials. Your line is open. 
Colin Gillis - BGC Financials
I just want to follow-up on the transition from transactional to long-term agreements and also the success with the renewals, can you just give a few factors for this? Is it the product roadmap? Is it cost savings?
Peter Klein
It's actually all of those things. Certainly the product roadmap and the new capabilities that we have across the board whether that's System Center 2012 and SQL Server 2012 which is now and what’s coming in Windows Server later this year as well as the public-private cloud story which really, really resonates. So what people are investing in is that roadmap, because they see where they are going long-term and they are partnering with us to get where they need to get long-term through their increased capabilities and our technology. And I’d add that total cost of ownership does play a big piece of that particularly on the SQL side.
Operator
Ed Maguire with CLSA. Your line is open. 
Ed Maguire - CLSA
I’d like to come back to Server & Tools. You mentioned Lync was growing 45%. What's behind that? Is it competitive wins or new implementations or attach in multi-component deals and also if you could address the impact of some of the licensing changes on the growth in SQL Server?
Peter Klein
So, let me start with Lync. And I will try and tame myself because I just love Lync. The reason it's growing so fast is because of the capabilities that it provides as well as the cost savings it provides for a company. It's really compelling and it really resonates well with customers. It’s a lot of new implementation, some of its competitive, some of its just new application that people think of really reimagining how communications happens. We are really excited at one place where Skype acquisition plays in and kind of what we showed a little bit this week with how we are really reimagining communications broadly for all of our customers. And that story really resonates very well. It's very easy to sell. It's very easy to see. The capabilities are very easy to show. So, that's just a great product, a great set of capability, a great value proposition for CIOs and end-users alike. And as Bill said, we think unified communication is a really big market opportunity for us, and we felt that for a longtime, and we are really starting to see it with this version of Lync, and what we are doing going forward.
Operator
Next we have Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen. Your line is open. 
Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company
The premium mix went down 6 points sequentially and was lower than we have seen in a while. Just wondering if you think a fair amount of this was perhaps driven by the Windows 8 program, where users can pay one price upgrade regardless of what Win 7 SKU that they buy or was it due to emerging markets and other factors?
Peter Klein
Mostly emerging markets. You are right about that.
Operator
Brad Reback with Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open. 
Brad Reback - Stifel Nicolaus
Peter, you talked about CapEx being about 3 billion. It's been running at about 2, 2.3 the last couple of years so about a 30% increase. What's that predominantly related to?
Peter Klein
Mostly related to the increase in our cloud businesses across the boards, and some we’re getting good adoption and acceleration. So, it's a little bit of an increased related across the board as Office 365 capacity.
Bill Koefoed

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
Okay. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Peter.
Peter S. Klein
Thanks, Bill, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. I'm pleased with our performance as we delivered another quarter of solid financial results. Our robust portfolio of enterprise products and services drove revenue growth of 6% to a third quarter record $17.4 billion. Combined with our ongoing operating expense discipline, even as we prepare for one of our biggest launch years, we delivered operating income growth of 12%. 
Let me provide more color on the business. Our Business Desktop offerings remain a top priority for CIOs. This quarter, businesses continued to refresh their hardware. And as a result, we saw healthy growth in business PCs around the world. As they purchase new PCs, businesses are also deploying Windows 7 and Office 2010 to increase productivity and manageability while reducing their total cost of ownership. Today, approximately 40% of enterprise desktops worldwide are on Windows 7, and we see continued momentum as the remaining desktops upgrade from Windows XP over the next 2 years. 
As CIOs look to address the needs of a more social and mobile workforce. Our productivity services such as Office 365 have become an important solution. Our communication and collaboration offerings such as Exchange, SharePoint and Lync all grew revenue double digits and are well positioned in this growing market. 
On the infrastructure side, the Server & Tools Business delivered double-digit revenue growth, with SQL Server leading the way. We've now launched System Center 2012 and SQL Server 2012, and the new versions of Windows Server and Visual Studio are on the horizon. Our product roadmap and vision are driving new customer wins and strong Enterprise Agreement renewals. We are confident that we are uniquely positioned to address the needs of CIOs as they strive to efficiently manage private and public clouds. 
Establishing a vibrant Windows Phone ecosystem is a priority for us, and we are working with our partners, including Nokia, to enable more features, markets and devices. We are pleased with our Nokia partnership and the pace of innovation across devices, including the Lumia 900, which recently launched on AT&T's 4G LTE network. 
In gaming and entertainment, while industry console sales were softer than our expectations, we continue to maintain our shared leadership position. With Xbox LIVE, we are adding more content and partners as we expand the entertainment experience and build on our leading position in the living room. 
And in Search, we are focused on addressing RPS and operating performance. We are seeing our hard work pay off with year-over-year improvements in both areas. 
In summary, solid revenue growth, and our ongoing commitment to fiscal discipline delivered strong financial results. We are enthusiastic about the market reception to our products and services as we continue to execute well, heading into our launch wave. With that, I'm going to hand it back to Bill to provide more details on this quarter's results, then I'll come back and provide some thoughts on our outlook for our fourth quarter and the next fiscal year.
Bill Koefoed
Thanks, Peter. First, I'm going to review our overall results and then I'll move on to the details by business segment. 
Revenue for the quarter was $17.4 billion, up 16% or roughly $1 billion. Operating income was up 12% to $6.4 billion, cash flow from operations was a record $9.6 billion and earnings per share was $0.60. Remember, in Q3 last year, we had a $461 million or $0.05 per share benefit related to a partial tax settlement with the IRS. And if you exclude that, EPS grew 7% for the quarter. 
Foreign exchange did not materially impact our net income this quarter. From a geographic perspective, developed markets remained healthy, and we saw strong double-digit growth in emerging markets. Businesses continue to make long-term investments in the Microsoft platform, and as a result, multi-year licensing, as a percentage of our total revenue, grew to approximately 40%. 
This quarter, we saw strong Enterprise Agreement growth in both new business and renewals. At the end of the quarter, unearned revenue was $15.2 billion, up 17%, and our contracted not billed balance was over $19 billion. 
Moving on to the PC market. We estimate the worldwide PC market grew 2% to 4% this quarter. Business PCs grew 8% as businesses continued to upgrade their hardware and software to Windows 7. When excluding netbooks, consumer PCs grew 6%. We are pleased with the early demand for Ultrabooks as they reinvigorate personal computing with innovative design, high performance and enhanced battery life. 
Now I'll move on to the results for the Windows and Windows Live Division, where revenue was up 4%. As in past quarters, you'll find the OEM revenue bridge in our earnings slide deck. Overall, Windows revenues slightly outgrew the underlying PC market due to the strength of the business refresh and attach gains in several geographic regions. 
In late February, we made the Windows 8 Consumer Preview available. It is important to note that the development of Windows 8 on both Intel and ARM is proceeding on our schedule. 
Now I'll move on to the Microsoft Business Division where revenue grew 9%. Consumer revenue increased 2%, while business transactional revenue grew 5%, again, outperforming our historical trends. Multi-year licensing revenue grew 13% as customers continued their commitment to our productivity services. As businesses embrace social enterprise scenarios, they are turning to the combined power of Exchange, SharePoint and Lync to enable their presence, collaboration and communication needs. This quarter, Exchange and SharePoint both grew double digits, while Lync revenue growth accelerated to over 35%. 
During the quarter, we launched the technical preview of the next version of Office, codenamed Office 15, with public beta coming later this summer. Our Dynamics business continued its momentum and revenue grew double-digits. Dynamics CRM revenue grew over 30% with more than 2.25 million users and 33,000 customers who leverage Dynamics CRM every day. 
Now let's move to Server & Tools, which posted another solid quarter with 14% revenue growth and over 20% bookings growth. Transactional revenue grew low single-digits, roughly in line with the underlying server hardware market growth. Multi-year licensing revenue was up high teens, and Enterprise Services once again grew more than 20%. 
Our growth and market success this quarter demonstrates that our customers really value our unique ability to deliver a solution which spans the private and public cloud. In the private cloud, Windows Server premium revenue grew high teens, and System Center grew more than 20%. We launched the beta version of Windows Server 2012 and announced the general availability of System Center 2012, which will help customers progress beyond virtualization to build efficient and secure hybrid cloud. 
In the public cloud, we recently announced strategic partnerships with leading service providers, Accenture and Hitachi, to offer enterprise-ready cloud solutions on our Windows Azure platform to accelerate application deployment and migration. We are the only company which can deliver a common identity, virtualization, management and development platform to our customers across both private and public clouds. 
In our data platform business, SQL Server revenue grew high teens while SQL premium revenue grew more than 30% as customers increasingly selected the premium edition to power their business intelligence and mission-critical workload needs. In early April, we announced general availability of SQL Server 2012, which now enables businesses to scale on-demand and create flexible hybrid deployment. Hundreds of global industry-leading customers such as Mitsui, Volvo, Revlon and LG Chemical have already deployed SQL Server 2012 for production use to leverage its enhanced performance, reliability and high-availability features. 
We also recently announced the second preview of Hadoop-based services with customers such as Webtrends using it to glean simple, actionable insights from complex data sets hosted in the cloud. Hadoop integration, along with the powerful analytic capabilities in SQL Server 2012, position us well to capture the full potential of big data growth. 
With major releases in each of our server product offerings, we continue to strengthen our enterprise portfolio and empower businesses to be both more agile and efficient. 
Moving on to the Online Services Division, revenue grew 6% and operating performance improved by $300 million. This quarter, online advertising revenue was up 9%, driven by volume and rate improvements in our Search business. 
In the Entertainment & Devices Division, revenue declined 16%, reflecting the soft gaming console market. Xbox maintained its share leadership in the U.S. this quarter, and we continue to expand the content available in Xbox LIVE with the release of 3 new major entertainment applications: Comcast XFINITY TV, HBO GO and MLB.TV, all with Kinect integration. 
We are working to bring Windows Phone to more people. Our progress can be seen with the April launch of 4G LTE phone through AT&T, our launch in China with multiple OEMs and the enabling of sub-$200 phones with more silicon support. With this work and with the building enthusiasm around Windows Phones, we have seen the number of apps published in the marketplace increase by 50% over the past 3 months. 
Turning to Skype, we continue to be pleased with both the pace of the integration and the rapid growth of the business. This quarter, Skype users made over 100 billion minutes of calls over the Skype network, an increase of 40% from the prior year. 
I will now cover the remainder of the income statement. Cost of goods sold increased 1%, reflecting changes in the mix of products and services sold. Operating expenses were $7.1 billion, an increase of 4%, mainly due to higher people costs. Operating income increased 12% to $6.4 billion.  And this quarter, we returned $2.7 billion to shareholders in buybacks and dividends. 
To summarize, we saw strong enterprise uptake for our server and Office products and continued business demand for PCs, leading to healthy top line growth. Along with our revenue growth, we were able to drive margin expansion with our strong focus on cost management. And with that, I will hand it back to Peter who's going to discuss our business outlook.
Peter S. Klein
Thanks, Bill. For the remainder of the call, I'll discuss our expectations for the fourth quarter and some high-level themes as we begin to think about fiscal 2013. 
Let me start with the fourth quarter. Within the PC market, we expect growth in business PCs to outpace consumer PCs and growth in emerging markets to outpace developed markets. In the Microsoft Business Division, multi-year licensing revenue, which is approximately 60% of the division's total, should grow low double-digits. Transactional revenue, which is the remaining revenue in the division, should lag the overall PC market, reflecting a higher mix of PC shipments to emerging markets. 
Within Server & Tools, approximately 30% of the division's revenue comes from transactional licensing, 50% from multi-year licensing and 20% from Enterprise Services. We expect transactional revenue to generally track with the server hardware market, and multi-year licensing and Enterprise Services revenue to both grow high teens. 
In the Online Services Division, we will continue to focus on RPS improvements, as well as operating efficiencies. For our Entertainment & Devices Division, we expect revenue to grow low double-digits. We expect COGS to grow 8% to 12% for the fourth quarter. As has been the case in the prior quarters, the mix of revenues will continue to impact this number. 
We are revising our operating expense guidance downward to $28.3 billion to $28.7 billion for fiscal 2012. We expect our effective tax rate to be 19% to 21% for the fourth quarter, and we continue to expect capital expenditures for the full fiscal year to be about $2.5 billion. Unearned revenue will roughly follow historical sequential growth pattern. 
Now I'd like to spend a few minutes looking ahead to fiscal 2013, which will include an unprecedented refresh of our major products. With Windows 8 and its availability on both x86 and ARM, we believe the ecosystem will capitalize on the new range of capabilities and scenarios Windows 8 enable. 
In the enterprise, the addition of Windows Server 2012, combined with the momentum of SQL Server and System Center, position us to take share as businesses increasingly look to cloud-optimize their IT infrastructure. And in productivity, we believe Office 15 will help people work, collaborate and communicate smarter and faster than before, driving growth in the Office business. Consumers will see ongoing innovation in Xbox, Skype, Windows Phone and Bing. So as you can see, there is a lot to look forward to next year. 
We expect fiscal 2013 operating expenses to be $30.3 billion to $30.9 billion, which represents growth of 6% to 8% from the midpoint of our updated fiscal 2012 guidance, as we continue to prioritize our spending and manage our expenses against the backdrop of a big product release year. 
In closing, our product portfolio is stronger than it has ever been, and customer satisfaction with our products and services is high. And with our latest wave of innovation, paired with the ongoing operating expense discipline, we are well positioned to continue delivering value to shareholders. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill, and we'll take some questions.
Bill Koefoed
Thanks, Peter. We want to get to questions from as many of you as possible, so please stick to just one question and avoid long or multi-part question. Operator, can you please go ahead and repeat your instruction?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adam Holt of Morgan Stanley.
Adam H. Holt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
My question is about the enterprise upgrade cycle. The clock is ticking on XP obviously, but you're only at 40% of the enterprises upgraded. Where do you think that number goes? Do you think it's front-end loaded towards calendar '12 versus calendar '13? And how do you think about how that impacts the model given some recovery with ELAs?
Peter S. Klein
Well, the only thing I could say, Adam, is obviously, it's high on the priority list for CIOs to upgrade their business desktop. And we've seen that. We've seen that in deployments as we talked about, and it remains a high priority. Exactly how that will play out over the next couple of years is hard to say. The momentum's been great so far. It remains a top priority, so we see that momentum continuing really over the next couple years.
Operator
Our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
I was just wondering, Peter, a few years ago, and you might not have been CFO at the time, you guys had talked about online and what your goals were 5 years out, and talking about 20% organic market share and that could get you to breakeven. I mean, given what we're seeing in terms of RPS, although you're doing a very good job on the OpEx side, how would you say you're thinking about that today?
Peter S. Klein
Well, thanks, Heather. The same basic dynamics continue, right? We need to do 2 things: we need to grow our share, we need to grow our RPS. So really improve our monetization. At the same time, it's managing the operating performance, which we've been doing. So the same characteristics apply. We are making progress on both counts, as Bill indicated. We saw gains in both volume and rate, and we need to continue to do that sort of monotonically sort of quarter after quarter and year after year.
Bill Koefoed
Yes, I would just add on to that, and I've been reminding some investors to go back and watch the FAM presentation that Qi Lu gave back in September. We do view our Search asset as a pretty strategic asset for the company. The capabilities that it offers are leveraged across our -- we think can be leveraged across our whole product set. So I do think our strategy has evolved from whatever conversation you had a couple, 3 years ago because we see the opportunity to leverage the asset being even more powerful than maybe we did at that point. But a good reminder if people haven't looked at that video, you can go back and look at it on the site.
Operator
The next question comes from Rick Sherlund of Nomura.
Richard G. Sherlund - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
On EDD, just sort of curious whether there's anticipation. We're not really looking for much at E3 this year. I think new console, people are thinking is maybe next year. There is Halo 4 coming. Just how are you thinking about, with more and more gaming going to mobile, what do you think the outlook is beyond next quarter for EDD? Or do we need a new console cycle to create growth in that segment?
Peter S. Klein
Thanks, Rick. We feel really good about both our sort of market position and our strategy. If you think about what we've done over the last couple of years, we've really staked out a unique value proposition and a unique strategy when it comes to not just the gaming console but also the UI technology with Kinect, and importantly, our Xbox LIVE and all the entertainment content that comes with that, which we view as a persistent long-term revenue stream, both from a subscriber perspective as well as a transactional perspective. And so we feel great about our leadership position. We've been the #1 console for the last 15 months or so. We feel great about our unique value proposition and the growing business we have with both Kinect and LIVE, and we think that's really persistent. If you look at the engagement that our subscribers have, the amount of time they spend doing entertainment as opposed to gaming is increasing all the time. And so I think the strategy and the value proposition there plays out very well over the next several years.
Richard G. Sherlund - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
And will Skype be a big benefit to that division going forward?
Peter S. Klein
Skype will be a big benefit across the company as we've talked about how it plays across all of our businesses.
Operator
Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard of Citi.
Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
Peter, you guys had a much better enterprise performance than I think most of the peers that we've seen report that are enterprise-exposed, IBM, et cetera. And I'm wondering if you could help us out with understanding where you saw strength across your business there. Was it more small business, medium business enterprise? Was there any trends there that might help us understand why you're outperforming some of your peers?
Peter S. Klein
Thanks, Walter. Yes, it was all segments, but I would highlight the enterprise, and it's really broad-based. I mean, businesses are investing in data centers. They're investing in their desktops because they see technology as a way to really both cut costs and improve their strategic positioning. For a while, CIOs have been saying Microsoft is a top priority, and we're really, really starting to see that both on the infrastructure side and the desktop side. We feel great about our product lineup, particularly in Server & Tools. If you think of what we've done with System Center and SQL Server and the upcoming release of Windows Server 2012, we kind of have a unique value proposition for enterprises, which is all about the hybrid private and public cloud which nobody else really has. And we've seen growth across both of those things. Similarly on the Business division side, we've broadened the Office business in several important ways over the last several years. One is in the experiences and workloads that people are getting in communications and collaboration, and that's been a huge growth driver. And secondly, again, it's cloud services and how that expands from helping people understand our roadmap from where they are today to how to get to the public cloud. I think those things taken together across-the-board have allowed us to take share and allowed us to grow both of those business, and you're really starting to see that take hold. And we're really excited about the product lineup that's coming in the next 6 to 9 months.
Bill Koefoed
Yes, I'd just add on to that, that I think that -- I think investors sometimes put companies in a box and say, ""You're either in private cloud or you're in public cloud. "" And as Peter mentioned, we're in both. I mean, we have high growth rates in both and we are, as Peter said, really the only company that's got that breadth of offerings and the growth rate on both the private, the public and then importantly, we've kind of coined this term, of hybrid IT where you can have a roadmap as you kind of want to use both to manage your IT infrastructure. So yes, we feel really good about where we are and the share that we're taking in the marketplace for sure.
Operator
Our next question comes from Brent Thill of UBS.
Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
You commented that you saw strong multiyear licensing, and I was just curious if you could just talk about how the upcoming cycle is helping influence that. And if I caught this right, Bill, I think you mentioned new enterprise agreements. You also saw strength there. So if could you talk through the dynamics of what you're seeing on these multiyear deals.
Peter S. Klein
Yes, the way that the product pipeline impacts our multiyear licensing business is enterprises are, when they invest in a multiyear licensing agreement, they're invest -- they're making a long-term investment in their platforms, in their infrastructure and they're making a long-term investment in their vendors. And so it's important to really understand the roadmap. And that's where the pipeline really helps, and that's really been, I think, a big driver so far. And that applies not only to the workloads and the capabilities and the products themselves, but as Bill just mentioned, the private and public cloud roadmap because people really are starting to think about long term, how do they make that transition from where they are today in their data centers to a public cloud world. So having that roadmap and having that pipeline really impacts our current period Enterprise business, and I think that's what you saw, not only in Server & Tools but also in the Business division as well.
Operator
Our next question comes from Mark Moerdler of Sanford Bernstein.
Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
So you've seen -- we saw strong numbers in System Center growing well as well as SQL Server, and yet we're just about to enter a product cycle. Normally, I guess they would slow down a bit. What do you think is the driver of why this has continued to accelerate into the cycle?
Peter S. Klein
I'll just go back to our continued vision, our continued roadmap, the capabilities that we're offering. I mean, it's a combination of the features and capabilities particularly in System Center 2012 and SQL Server 2012. And SQL Server 2012 is an amazing value proposition when you think about its scalability, when you think about business intelligence and analytics and when you think about the roadmap to the public cloud. People are understanding not only current features in the product, but they are looking towards the future roadmap. And I think that's what's really, really driving that.

The next question comes from Philip Winslow of Credit Suisse.
Philip Winslow - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
I just got another question on the Server & Tools division. Obviously, Intel is coming out with a new chip, Romley here, probably shipping to OEMs now, probably see it actually being delivered in servers late Q2, Q3 in the calendar. How do you think that these chip cycles actually are going to impact your business?
Peter S. Klein
Super excited about it, but I think about the business more broadly obviously, customers making long-term investments in their roadmap. We love what they're doing. We think that's an interesting thing. And to the extent the ecosystem technology evolves, that's always a good thing for how businesses are investing in their infrastructure. But I wouldn't want to overstate it as a much broader issue in terms of the long-term roadmap. But certainly having advances in technology, whether it's in hardware or in the data center, is a great thing, I'll allow.

Our next question comes from John DiFucci of JPMorgan.
John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Peter and then Bill, I think the Windows numbers were a little stale out there as far as consensus numbers. But even when you adjust for the more recent PC unit shipment data and something in line with what you guys said, I think PC, I think Gartner and IDC were at least in the neighborhood there. Maybe when you make those adjustments, the Windows business was even stronger than what we would have expected anyway. And I guess I'm just trying to try to get a little more color on that or figure that out. I guess a question maybe on the OEM revenue bridge, you got plus 2% from attach and inventory. Bill, I think you said that business refresh in attach was strong in some regions. But I think -- I would think anyway that given that PC shipments are much stronger in emerging markets, even if some emerging markets were a little bit better than normal, you'd still wouldn't necessarily get an aggregate attach that would be stronger. So I guess the question is, was there a meaningful move in inventory, OEM inventory that helped a bit this quarter? Because those numbers are stronger than they I would've thought.
Peter S. Klein
Thanks. I know -- it's actually a couple things. One, yes, on emerging markets. The business PC is what really drove the Windows business. And so if you think about the Windows revenue growth being really on the high end of our estimated PC shipment range, it's really a function of: one, business PC is really doing well relative to consumers. And again, that's consistent with the theme we've seen on businesses investing in their technology. And in addition to that, we had -- we did see some attach gains. I mean, and that's just reductions in piracy kind of broadly, not in any one place. That was a tailwind this quarter. As you know, sometimes that's not always a tailwind. In general, in the long term, that tends to be on the uptick. But this quarter, that attach and inventory gain is really partially attach.

Our next question comes from Kash Rangan of Merrill Lynch.

Our next question comes from Colin Gillis of BGC Financial.
Colin Gillis - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division
Can you just update us on the changes and the refresh in the marketing group? Where the priorities are for the spend? And any major upcoming campaigns?
Peter S. Klein
Yes, the marketing organization continues on. We are always making sort of tweaks and changes and making sure we're being as efficient and effective as possible and getting all the resources where we want them. If you think more broadly about our marketing focus as a company, clearly heading into this launch wave of our major core products like Windows, like Office, like Windows Server, you can imagine we're going to be focusing most of our marketing talent and most of our attention on those areas.
Operator
Our next question comes from Brendan Barnicle of Pacific Crest Securities.
Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division
Peter, should we assume that we're going to see the same Windows upgrade rights around Windows 8 that we've seen around prior releases? And therefore, should we be expecting to see some big swings in Windows revenue at some point in the middle of next year because -- or at some point during next year because of the deferrals like we've seen in the past?
Peter S. Klein
Thanks, Brendan. Obviously, we're super excited about the launch of Windows 8, and we're heads down trying to get that released. We haven't said anything and will not today, but we'll have more to talk about in terms of programs and promotions as we get closer to the launch date.
Operator
Our next question comes from Ed Maguire of CLSA.
Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division
When you look through the pretty extensive product refreshes you have across the portfolio, are you thinking that there may be the possibility that customers may pause in any of your products? And as you look at seasonality, is there a likelihood that we might see a bit more pronounced seasonality leading up into some of the big launches?
Peter S. Klein
I think generally, particularly in the enterprise, you don't really see a seasonality impact. If you think about how large enterprises plan their information technology spend, they sort of have a long-term roadmap. They're on it. They execute against it when they do. Obviously, our long-term roadmap, as I've said, impacts that. And so it's more about their long-term planning cycles than it is about sort of any product cycle, particularly in the enterprise, which is where a lot of the growth is coming from and a lot of the products are coming for.
Operator
Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow of Barclays.
Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Research Division
I was having a forward-looking question on the gross margin. Remember in the last few quarters where you had a slight negative mix effect there. As I look into the new product launches into the next year, is there anything -- they're all kind of high gross margin areas. Is there anything that stops that feeding through in the P&L? Or should it be a straightforward one?
Peter S. Klein
You're correct, mix is what drives the gross margin percentage and obviously we saw that this quarter. And so you're right in the math of that. If there's good growth, better growth in higher-margin products, that will have a positive impact on gross margin.
Operator
Our next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz of Cowen.
Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division
This past quarter, both Gartner and IDC saw a better-than-expected PC uptick in the European corporate market. And your reported Windows revenues certainly support that. I know broadly speaking the business refresh was healthy. Just was wondering if there's anything you would add that might have contributed to an uptick in Europe PC growth.
Peter S. Klein
Nothing specific to add to that. We did -- as we talked about, we saw broad-based growth geographically in business in particular, and so there's nothing sort of unusual or specific in Europe about that.
Operator
Our last question comes from Jason Maynard of Wells Fargo.
Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
I had a question on this fiscal '13 OpEx guidance, which is a couple points, looks like if you use the midpoint, ahead of the fiscal '12 growth rate. And I'm just curious, the delta, obviously, I would assume would come to some of the product launches. But the question broader is do you think you have enough spend baked into that model to account for the big push you're going to need to make around perhaps on the smartphone side, given that, that's an area where you're coming from behind, given all the other products that you're going to be releasing and obviously consumer push in some of the new enterprise products?
Peter S. Klein
Thanks, Jason. Obviously, over the last several years and even longer, we've really been focused on making sure we're prioritizing our spend to the highest value areas, so you asked a good question. And our approach is exactly the same. Like we've done the last couple of years, we're really looking at next year and saying, ""How can we most effectively and most efficiently allocate the resources to the areas that drive the best long-term results?"" And we think we've got a good balance there as we've had in the past. We've tried to be transparent and consistent in that, really predictably execute against that. And I think what we've got next year is a good balance between the exciting launches that we have that really drive both short- and long-term growth, as well as hopefully a good financial result. Okay, so that will wrap up our Q&A portion of today's earnings call. We look forward to seeing many of you at the numerous conferences in which we'll be participating this quarter.

Welcome to Microsoft's Fiscal Year 2012 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Bill Koefoed, General Manager, Investor Relations. Bill, you may begin.
Bill Koefoed
Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. As usual, with me today are Peter Klein, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel.
On our website is our financial summary slide deck, which is intended to follow our prepared remarks and provides the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. This information is available at microsoft.com/investor.
As a reminder, we will post today's prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and any future use of the recording.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
Okay, and with that, I'll turn the call over to Peter.
Peter S. Klein
Thanks, Bill, and thanks everyone for joining us. I'm pleased with our performance this quarter. Despite a challenging PC market, we delivered solid financial results. We saw a strong demand for our business products and services and had a record holiday season, driven by the unique entertainment experience we have built with Xbox 360.
This quarter, the strength of our product portfolio enabled us to grow revenue 5% to $20.9 billion. Combined with our ongoing operating expense discipline, even as we prepare for a big launch year, we delivered record earnings per share of $0.78. 
Similar to prior periods, we saw a broad-based growth across geographies, with particular strength in emerging markets. Within our segments, the Microsoft Business Division had another good quarter as businesses and consumers around the world look to Microsoft to meet their productivity needs. Six quarters post-launch, Office 2010 continues to exceed our expectation, with increased consumer and business PC Attach worldwide. 
We saw double-digit revenue growth across our key business application workloads, including Exchange, SharePoint, Lync and Dynamics CRM and ERP. As businesses large and small look to the cloud to lower costs and enable new ways of supporting a distributed workforce, they are turning to Microsoft. With Office 365, we give customers powerful productivity and collaboration tools at great value. Today, more than 100,000 businesses have made the commitment to our Online Services. Whether on-premise or in the cloud, Microsoft remains the top choice for productivity. 
The Server & Tools Business delivered another strong quarter, as we continue to execute on our strategy of cloud optimizing every business. CIOs are increasingly turning to our business infrastructure offerings, including Windows Server, Hyper-V and System Center as they look to Microsoft for the security, flexibility and manageability they need to build world-class private clouds. This quarter marked the ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for Windows Server Premium revenue and the 11th quarter of double-digit revenue growth for System Center. 
On the data platform, we remain the worldwide unit share leader with SQL Server. Consistent with our strategy, we are growing our revenue share with marquee customer wins on mission-critical workloads and business intelligence capabilities.
This year, we will bring to market the next generation of our server offerings, including Windows Server 8, SQL Server 2012 and System Center 2012, which deepen and broaden our platform for the private cloud. Combined with the power of Windows Azure for the public cloud, our offerings give enterprises the identity, virtualization, application development and management tools they need to efficiently progress into the new era of hybrid IT.
The PC market was challenged this quarter, with particular softness in the consumer segment. However, Windows 7 momentum in the enterprise continued and today, over 1/3 of enterprise desktops worldwide are on Windows 7. And with the future release of Windows 8, we believe the ecosystem will benefit from the new range of capabilities and scenarios that it enables.
In Search, we saw improvements in RPS this quarter as we partnered closely with Yahoo! to address the monetization challenges of the combined ad platform. We are pleased with the progress and are working hard to continue that trajectory.
In the years since Windows Phone launch, we have worked diligently alongside our partners, including Nokia, to bring a differentiated experience to the mobile platform. Earlier this month at the Consumer Electronics Show, we showcased the latest innovation in Windows Phone to very positive reviews. With these new devices, we are increasing the choices for consumers around the world to find a Windows Phone that is exactly right for them.
As I mentioned, Xbox 360 had a record holiday season as we continue to differentiate home entertainment. Whether it's using Bing Voice Search on Xbox to quickly find the movies and shows you want to watch or enabling more interactive TV as we demonstrated at CES with Sesame Street and Elmo, Xbox and Kinect are bringing together our technologies to redefine the living room experience. Beyond gaming and entertainment, with the Kinect for Windows program which launches February 1, our technology will further innovation and creativity across industries.
During the quarter, we started the integration of Skype's world-class communication products and global network platform into our portfolio of products and services. While it is still early, we are excited by the momentum we have seen thus far and by the opportunities to redefine social and real-time communications for consumers and businesses around the world.
As I have consistently mentioned, operating expense management is a priority for Microsoft. Reflecting our ongoing discipline and prioritization of investments, operating expenses grew just 4% this quarter.
In summary, we delivered solid financial results despite a challenging PC market. The strength of our product portfolio drove solid top line growth, we delivered record earnings per share and we are well positioned for future growth. 
With that, I'm going to hand it back to Bill to provide more details on our results.
Bill Koefoed
Thanks, Peter. First, I'm going to review our overall results, and then I'll move on to the details by business segment. Revenue for the quarter was a record $20.9 billion, up 5% or $900 million year-over-year. Operating income was $8 billion, cash flow from operations was $5.9 billion and earnings per share was $0.78. Foreign exchange did not materially impact our net income this quarter.
Enterprise demand remains strong as our customers continue to add both product and seats to their Enterprise Agreement, and our renewal rates remain solid. At the end of the quarter, unearned revenue was $15.3 billion, and our contracted not billed balance was approximately $19 billion.
Turning to the PC market, as I mentioned last week, it was a challenging quarter for the industry. Factors such as the flooding in Thailand, macroeconomic uncertainty and competing form factors resulted in an overall market that we estimate declined 2% to 4%.
In the PC market, it appears that the impact of the hard drive supply chain constraints were not limited to a specific region or OEM type. While absolute volumes were impacted, we did see the following trends continue: PC sales to emerging markets outpaced developed markets; the business PC refresh cycle continued with business PC growth of 2%; the decline of netbooks negatively impacted consumer PCs which were down 6%. Netbooks, which a year ago represented about 8% of the PC market, now represents only 2%. Excluding netbooks, consumer PCs grew 2%. 
Now I'll move on to the results for the Windows and Windows Live Division, where revenue was down 6%. As usual, you'll find the OEM revenue bridge in our earnings slide deck. The primary differences between the PC market and Windows revenue were the continuing growth of emerging markets faster than developed markets and inventory drawdown from the prior quarter. 
We have now sold 525 million Windows 7 licenses since launch. And as Peter mentioned, we are seeing sustained momentum on enterprise deployments. In December, we announced that Windows 8 beta would be available in late February, and we also previewed the Windows Store, which will be the hub where users can discover and download applications. For developers, the Windows Store represents a significant opportunity given its broad reach, flexibility and favorable economic terms.
Now I'll move on to the Microsoft Business Division, where revenue grew 3%. Recall in Q2 last year that we recognized $224 million of revenue for the Office 2010 Technology Guarantee Program. And if you exclude that, revenue grew 7% for the quarter. 
Consumer revenue declined 17% year-over-year and declined 2% when factoring in the impact of the Technology Guarantee Program that I just mentioned. The outperformance relative to the overall PC market was driven by Attach games, which continued despite being 18 months since the launch of Office 2010.
Business revenue grew 9%. And within Business, multiyear licensing revenue grew 12% and transactional revenue grew 3%, driven by strong Attach worldwide.
We continue to see strong growth in our productivity solution offerings. Lync, SharePoint and Exchange each grew double digits. We've previously shared with you the opportunity that we see for unified communications, and we are beginning to realize that potential. Lync revenue grew over 30% as customers such as Volkswagen and LA Fitness chose Microsoft to be their voice and video solution.
This quarter, Office 365 became this first major cloud provider to comply with leading EU and U.S. standards for data protection. Meeting these high standards enables businesses to more fully realize the potential of the cloud. We also had our first major service enhancement to Office 365, which extends the company's next-generation cloud productivity service to reach businesses in 22 additional markets. 
During the quarter, companies such as JetBlue, Campbell Soup, Patagonia and Wunderman chose Office 365 to enable their employees and customers to work together in the cloud. We are also pleased with the momentum and cloud services for education, where we now have more than 22 million users, a 100% increase over the prior year.
Our Dynamics business continued its momentum, where revenue grew double digits both in CRM and ERP. Dynamics CRM revenue grew over 30%. Dynamics CRM had important competitive wins this quarter against Salesforce.com and Oracle, such as Safety-Kleen Systems and the American Heart Association. The common theme among switchers was that Dynamics CRM has a familiar user interface, which improves productivity while delivering lower operating costs than the competition. 
Now let's move on to Server & Tools where revenue grew 11%, driven by multiyear license revenue that was up mid-teens in Enterprise Services. We saw broad-based strength across our products. In our data platform business, SQL Server grew low double-digits, outpacing industry growth due to the strength of our premium edition. This quarter, we saw competitive database wins against Oracle such as U.K.-based retailer, The Co-operative Group, which switched to SQL Server because of its advantages in business intelligence, security, flexibility and cost. We also saw a strong market anticipation for SQL Server 2012 with over 100,000 downloads in the 2 months since the release candidate was made available.
In the private cloud, Windows Server premium revenue grew high teens, and System Center grew over 20%. On Tuesday, we announced System Center 2012 which brings many of our Azure cloud capabilities to an integrated private cloud management solution for the first time. We also announced great competitive wins against VMware with accounts such as T. Rowe Price, Unilever and Lufthansa Systems. 
System Center 2012 integrates each separate component products into one unified solution, streamlining installation and reducing the time it takes to deploy from days down to hours. Additionally, we've provided a clear path to Windows Azure for customers who are looking for a public or hybrid cloud solution.
In the public cloud, our December release of Azure enhanced ease-of-use and simplified deployment, as well as delivered new open source capabilities with Hadoop support. We are seeing strong growth in the number of large customers signing up to use Azure. One such example is Sony Pixar's Crackle online content service, which has moved to Azure due to the cost savings, agility and performance it provides. 
Now I'll move on to the Online Services Division, where revenue grew 10% and operating performance improved for the second consecutive quarter. Online advertising revenue was up 13%, driven primarily by Search. The increase in Search revenue was driven by both rate and volume improvement. Bing's U.S. organic market share ended the quarter at 15.1%, up 40 basis points this quarter and over 300 basis points year-over-year.
Now let me move to the Entertainment & Devices Division, where revenue grew 15%. According to a third-party research, Xbox was the #1 console in the U.S. during calendar year 2011 and had 46% of U.S. console sales in December. During the quarter, we sold 8.2 million consoles, which was up over 25% despite a soft gaming console market. Kinect continues to impress customers with 18 million Kinects having been sold since launch just over 1 year ago. Xbox LIVE members grew 33%, with 40 million users now enjoying Xbox LIVE.
In December, Xbox released the new Metro style dashboard and added dozens of new entertainment applications and content partners to the platform. While it is early, engagement has been quite impressive as the number of people using entertainment apps from November to December increased by almost 50%.
We continue to make progress with Windows Phone. During the quarter, Nokia began to bring some of their great new devices to market, which adds to the growing list of compelling phones available from our OEM partners. At CES, the talk of the show was the new LTE Windows Phones from Nokia and HTC that will be available on AT&T in the coming months, joining the Lumia 710, which is now available on T-Mobile. 
In October, Skype officially joined Microsoft. This quarter, over 200 million people used Skype to communicate with family, friends and businesses. For calendar year 2011, over 300 billion minutes of calls were made over the Skype network, an increase of 50%. The teams are working closely on the integration across Microsoft, and we will share more as we get further along the road map.
Now let me cover the remainder of the income statement. Cost of goods sold increased 17%, driven by the following: first, we saw an increase in costs resulting from the strong Xbox console sales and increased Xbox royalties; second, Enterprise Services continue to grow rapidly; and third, Online Services and traffic acquisition costs increased. 
Operating expenses were $7.3 billion, an increase of 4%, driven primarily due to compensation, legal expenses and Puerto Rican excise taxes. This quarter, we've returned $2.7 billion to shareholders in buybacks and dividends.
So in summary, we saw a strong demand from our business customers, and our Xbox platform delivered a record holiday season. We were able to navigate a challenging PC market to deliver solid top line and earnings per share growth. 
With that, I will hand it back to Peter who's going to discuss our business outlook.
Peter S. Klein
Thanks, Bill. For the remainder of the call, I'll discuss our expectations for the third quarter and full fiscal year.
Beginning with the Windows and Windows Live Division. We expect revenue to continue to be impacted by market dynamics similar to the past several quarters. PC growth in emerging markets will outpace developed markets, and business PC growth will outpace consumer PC growth. We also expect the hard disk drive shortage to continue to challenge the PC market to at least the next quarter.
Turning to the Microsoft Business Division. For the third quarter and full fiscal year, transactional revenue, approximately 40% of the division's total, should lag the overall PC market, reflecting a higher mix of PC shipments to emerging markets. And multiyear licensing revenue, approximately 60% of the division's total, should grow low double-digits. 
Moving to Server & Tools. Approximately 30% of the division's revenues comes from transactional licensing, 50% from multiyear licensing and 20% from Enterprise Services. For the third quarter and full fiscal year, we expect transactional revenue to generally track with the hardware market, multiyear licensing revenue should grow low double-digits, and Enterprise Services revenue should grow high teens.
Turning to the Online Services Division. We are focused on improving the financial performance of our Search business and are looking for ways to increase RPS and streamline costs. For the third quarter and full fiscal year, we expect revenue to show year-over-year improvements in RPS. 
Moving on to the Entertainment & Devices Division. We continue to be very pleased with our share of the worldwide console market. However, the console market is softer than we previously expected, and as a result, we now expect revenue to grow high single-digits for the third quarter and mid-teens for the full fiscal year.
Switching to overall cost of goods sold for the company. COGS growth will continue to be impacted by the changing mix of revenue as we have seen the past few quarters. We expect COGS to grow about 8% to 10% for the third quarter and mid-teens for the full fiscal year. 
As a result of our focus on operating expense management, we are lowering our fiscal year guidance. We now expect operating expenses to be $28.5 billion to $28.9 billion for the full fiscal year, including the impact of Skype. This represents year-over-year growth of 5% to 6%. We expect our effective tax rate to be 19% to 21% for the third quarter and full fiscal year, and we still expect capital expenditures to be about $2.5 billion for the full fiscal year.
For the third quarter, unearned revenue should roughly follow historical seasonal patterns. We continue to expect unearned revenue at the end of the fiscal year to grow low double-digits compared to the prior fiscal year.
As we look forward, we have the strongest product pipeline we have ever had. We're pleased with the early enthusiasm around our upcoming wave of products that enable CIOs to cloud optimize their business. And we are excited by the opportunity to unify the consumer experience across our phones, PCs, tablets and TVs with our new Metro style design.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Bill and we'll take some questions.
Bill Koefoed
Thanks, Peter. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please go ahead and repeat your instructions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adam Holt.
Adam H. Holt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
My question is about the material improvement in OSD margins quarter-on-quarter. It looks like you held firm on expenses year-on-year. Does that reflect the new philosophy around that business in terms of driving profitability? And can you update us on where you think you are on the RPS improvement?
Peter S. Klein
Yes. As we've been saying, the key to profitability in that business is to grow our top line because it scales really well. The marginal impact of that is very high because it's a high fixed cost business. We have been, as we've been growing share and improving our RPS especially this quarter, holding the line on operating expenses and really streamlining. The most important thing long term, as we’ve said, is to continue to grow that share and grow the revenue per search, so we're pleased with that trajectory and want to keep on that. And we are watching the cost very carefully so that, that revenue marginally goes to the bottom line. And that's what you saw happen this quarter, and that's the trajectory we hope to stay on.
Operator
Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard of Citigroup.
Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
We're just wondering on the EDD side. It looks like you called out the Nokia payments as part of COGS as a driver. And I'm wondering, you've been pointing us to mix of revenue types as mainly the driver there of COGS. Could you help us out with how meaningful those payments were? And how should we expect those to continue to track as we move into future quarters?
Peter S. Klein
Yes, it's part of it. There were several things impacting the gross margins in the E&D business. Obviously, one is just the volume of consoles and the mix of consoles, high end versus low end, the mix of software whether it's first party or third party that has a different margin characteristic. And so that's the biggest piece in E&D. Then the Nokia piece is also another piece that plays into that. But the biggest piece is the mix of business in the E&D business and then Nokia is also another driver of that.
Operator
Our next question comes from Rick Sherlund of Nomura.
Richard G. Sherlund - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
On the hard drive shortage issue, I spoke with Gartner on Monday, and they were looking for PCs of down 1%. You guys have said down 2% to 4%, and they helped reconcile that, suggesting that there were some issues in terms of the pipeline of products. And if the inventories were reduced in the pipeline, that might reconcile why the 2 of you are viewing the industry somewhat differently. I'm just curious if you think that's going to continue into the next quarter. I know we're going to see an impact in this next quarter. I'm just curious whether you and Gartner might be more in line with each other going forward? Or if there's more inventory reduction in that pipeline that might be an ongoing impact above and beyond perhaps what we're seeing from the numbers that Gartner and IDC are giving us?
Peter S. Klein
Yes, that's impossible to say, Rick. I'd say obviously, for this quarter, we obviously are very confident and comfortable with the estimate as we said during the remarks. We expect the impact to continue on at least to the next quarter. And I think the best thing to do is at the end of that, we'll probably all have a better view and we kind of assess where we are and what it looks like going forward. I'd say just generally on the inventory as well, obviously, as I've said in my remarks, there was an inventory drawdown to end the quarter. I think there was an overall -- I think both IDC and Gartner have also talked about the fact that the overall supply chain for PCs is obviously leaner than it was 3 months ago. So we'll have to see how fast kind of people ramp back up, how fast the PC ecosystem rebounds, and that will obviously impact, as Peter mentioned, inventory at the end of the quarter as well. So good question.
Operator
Our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
I was wondering, Peter, if you could talk a little bit about which businesses are the furthest along regarding their COGS transition as you move more and more of your revenues to the cloud, if you could kind of rank order them for us?
Peter S. Klein
Yes, I'd say Office 365 is really far along. We've had a lot of good momentum and obviously, one of the things that drive -- you up the sort of margin scale -- is getting the economy to scale with volume, and we talked about some of the numbers, the 100,000 businesses the great sort of demand we've had for sort of the Office business all up including Office 365. So I'd say that's probably farthest along, followed closely by Windows Azure as we sort of add new enterprise customers, new ISVs, new developers to that. But certainly, Office 365 is accelerating at the ramp.
Bill Koefoed
And the other thing that I would add is obviously OSD is, we'll call it, kind of our largest cloud property. And as Peter mentioned earlier, I think in one of the questions, it obviously has achieved scale. And as a result, kind of every incremental kind of search ends up becoming 100% margin. So we are -- we're at different stages, I think, within some of the different business products. But certainly around running a cloud infrastructure, we feel like we've got quite good handle on that from -- primarily from our Search business.

Our next question comes from John DiFucci of JPMC.
John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
My question essentially follows to Rick. It has to do with the Windows OEM revenue bridge. Just curious on some of these items, how they fit today. For instance, and I believe, Bill and Peter, you take account for that inventory changes in the Windows Attach and inventory line. And last quarter, it added about 5% to the quarter. This quarter, it was a 2% hit. And Bill, you noted the inventory drawdown had an effect there. Can you give us a sense on where you think channel inventories are today relative to what you might call normal levels? And then also just quickly on that last line in that bridge, the OEM revenue adjustment, when is this stop -- going to stop being negative? It's been slightly negative for quite some time now. And shouldn't it have stopped like 3 years after the Vista launch because it -- wasn't it related to XP and having Internet Explorer as part of that as a meaningful part of that versus for Vista?
Peter S. Klein
Yes, we'll take the second one first. Next year, that should go away. So to answer your question, yes, that's what you would expect and that's what will happen. On your first question on inventory, at any given quarter, inventory is going to be -- sort of go up and down depending on what's going on in the channel. As you noted, sometimes, it's a tailwind, sometimes it's a headwind like it was this quarter. It's hard to say precisely what sort of -- where it stands and what it's going to be like next quarter. We'll sort of look at it when we get there.
Operator
Our next question comes from Mark Moerdler from San Bernstein.
Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
Question for you. How much of the year-over-year decrease in the consumer revenue on the Offices product is due to licensing, licenses specifically included in OEM sales of PCs as compared to stand-alone Office sales to the consumer market?
Peter S. Klein
It's mostly associated with OEM. I mean, the driver that we use for that part of the MBD business is specifically tied with the PC unit growth of consumers. And so as I mentioned in my remarks, we actually outperformed that but that's the best driver that -- it's not complete but that's the best driver of trying to be able to predict or interpret that result.
Operator
Our next question comes from Philip Winslow of Crédit Suisse.
Philip Winslow - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Just got a question on just the Windows division. When you think about the impact of Windows 8 coming out theoretically, obviously, the second half of this year, how do you think that's going to impact build plans amongst the OEMs but also inventory levels when we get to the summer?
Peter S. Klein
Probably pretty premature to talk about that. I think we need to get closer to it. So the thing I would say is just from an ecosystem perspective, there's an incredible amount of excitement and innovation going on across vendors like the chip vendors and all the OEMs. You actually see that starting today with the Ultrabooks that you're seeing with Windows 7. And so the fact of the matter is there's a ton of innovation happening today for Windows 7. There's a ton of excitement for enterprises for both Windows 7 and looking forward to Windows 8, and what that gives them in terms of an end user experience and IT manageability. So I don't think about it so much as looking forward. There's a ton of innovation going on today. You see it in Ultrabooks. You see it in what both the ARM and x86 chip vendors are doing, and so that sort of continues sort of on a regular pace.
Operator
Our next question comes from Kash Rangan of Merrill Lynch.
Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
If you look at the last few quarters, I know we've been through tough comps, sluggish slower revenue growth rate and also the mix issues that have caused the margins, the gross margins to go down. As you come out of this tough cycle and start to get into this, the next sort of launches, should we think about the gross margins as starting to go in the other direction just based on the -- what looks to be better mix between your Windows -- just typical software businesses as you get into launch year? Part of me it says maybe the margins are bottoming here. Of course, I completely respect the fact that you've got sort of another mix issues that are more longer term as you have Entertainment & Devices business, the cost there, et cetera. But shouldn't margins start to go back up as you head into launch year?
Peter S. Klein
Yes. Certainly, margins are a function of mix. And to the extent there’s a higher mix and higher margin products, that will have a positive impact on margins. And it's not unrealistic to think that in a launch year, you can see a higher growth in higher-margin products. So it will depend on what the mix is, but I think it's a very plausible scenario.
Operator
Our next question comes from Brendan Barnicle of Pacific Crest Securities.
Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division
I was wondering if you could give us any color on what you saw geographically in terms of growth trends in particular or any -- in particular in Europe or Asia, it was weak or strong?
Peter S. Klein
Yes. We saw a particular strength in emerging markets, particularly what we call the BRIC markets, Brazil, Russia, India and China. That was really a driver of growth for us. And that's exciting for us because we've had got strong and growing positions there, and that's where kind of disproportionate economic growth is happening sort of worldwide. But as Bill mentioned and as I mentioned, we saw a broad-based strength in demand across geographies but with particular strength in emerging markets.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ed Maguire of CLSA.
Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division
You called out 100,000 businesses that are engaged in Online Services. Could you comment on the impact that this transition is having on recognized revenues versus unearned and contracted not billed?
Peter S. Klein
Yes, it's interesting. Subscription businesses aren't that much different from our existing multiyear licensing business in the sense that it sort of bills upfront and then recognized over time, just like our multiyear licensing agreements. And so it really doesn't have a significant impact on the sort of flavor or character of our revenue recognition or unearned revenue.
Operator
Our next question comes from Brad Reback of Oppenheimer.
Brad Reback - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division
Great. Peter, the business PC growth rate was down about 300 basis points sequentially. Was that all economic or hard disk drive?
Peter S. Klein
Yes. I'd say -- the one thing I'd say is the overall business environment sort of remains very strong for us. And so sort of all of our sort of macro indicators for business spending on IT remain good, unearned revenue, our renewals for enterprise licensing agreements and sort of enterprise deployments of Windows 7. In terms of PCs, as we said, there's still growth and we're still in the refresh cycle. I do suspect that some of that, well, is due to supply chain and maybe a small amount due to macro but it's small.
Operator
Our next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz of Cowen.
Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division
Peter, you mentioned Ultrabooks earlier, and on the heels of CES, we're going to be seeing a lot more of them hit the market. Can you talk about what this means for Microsoft? And more importantly, when might Ultrabooks be ready for the mass market from a cost perspective?
Peter S. Klein
What it means -- for me, what it represents is sort of the excitement and the opportunity long term in building compelling devices for consumers and businesses around the world. There's so much innovation still to get done. There's so many new form factors, so many new use cases. And I think it's great to see what the ecosystem does when it works together, as I mentioned before. In terms of the sort of price points in mass market, we'll just sort of wait and see how that evolves before commenting on that.
Operator
Our next question comes from Tim Klasell of Stifel, Nicolaus.
Tim Klasell - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
Just a question on the EDD. You have mentioned about a softening in the console sales. Do you think that, that's due to mix shifting towards lower-priced units, or is that business just getting more seasonal? If we model that going forward, should we make that a more seasonal holiday type of an event than we currently do?
Peter S. Klein
In terms of the over -- first of all, yes, we feel -- for our console business, we feel really good about our sort of relative position in the market and our ability to take share and have a really strong competitive position. In terms of the seasonality, I don't think there's anything that indicates it's sort of more or less seasonal than we've seen in the past. Like many consumer businesses like this, it will always be relatively stronger at the holiday season. And in terms of some of the mixes, some of it's a function of product cycle. If you think about that Kinect centers and how we sold those into our installed base, and now we're selling more bundles, those kinds of things. Its seasonality hasn't marginally -- hasn't materially shifted.
Bill Koefoed
Obviously, when big-title games come out, that tends to also drive kind of a big cycle so that’s also something to pay attention to around this business.
Operator
Okay, our next question comes from Robert Breza of RBC Capital Markets.
Robert P. Breza - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
Bill, maybe could you just comment a little bit back on, I think it was a Crédit Suisse analysts talking about the Windows 8 release the end of February. Given the complexity you're adding into Windows 8 with mobile, et cetera, making that kind of a cross-platform experience, do you expect that to kind of delay the traditional milestones? Or how should we think about Windows 8 going forward?
Bill Koefoed
Yes, I wouldn't think about kind of traditional milestones. I would say one of the things that Tammy [ph] talked about at CES last week was just how important it is for us to work on and with developers to create a really vibrant developer ecosystem. And so one of the things we also talked about with the beta release was the Windows Store, really making sure we're going to have quite a few apps that are going to be up on the Windows Store at beta. Obviously, one of the things she and Steve both talked about last week is that any Windows 7 PC could run Windows 8. But obviously, there’ll be kind of some new and interesting form factors that are going to come out here as we get further on down the road. So I don't know that I would think about it except, as we said earlier, we're on track. We feel really good about where we are on the product, and this next super important milestone is the beta release and having a really great developer ecosystem that kind of surround that. So great question.
Okay, so that will wrap up the Q&A portion of today's call. We look forward to seeing many of you at the numerous conferences in which we're going to be participating at this quarter. For those of you unable to attend those events in person, you will be able to follow our comments at microsoft.com/investor. Please contact me or anyone on my team if you need the additional details.

Welcome to Microsoft's Fiscal Year 2012 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Bill Koefoed, General Manager of Investor Relations. Bill, you may begin.
Bill Koefoed
Thank you, Carol, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. As usual, with me today are Peter Klein, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel.

Okay, and with that, I'll turn the call over to Peter.
Peter S. Klein
Thanks, Bill, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. Today, I’m pleased to share with you our first quarter financial results. We’ve started fiscal year 2012 with good momentum. We have great products in market, customer satisfaction is high, and we have important strategic investments and alliances to position us well for long-term growth. 
This quarter, we saw revenue growth across all of our segments. Similar to prior periods, we continued to see broad-based demand across geographies, including Europe. Within our segments, the Microsoft Business Division continued its momentum with revenue of $5.6 billion, growth of 8%. Despite the best efforts of competitors, Office remains the overwhelming choice for productivity, evolving with our customers and posting impressive revenues.  
We are extremely pleased by the market reception to Office 2010 this far into the launch cycle. We’re 15 months post-launch, but we still saw an increase in the consumer PC attach rate for Office this quarter. And, for businesses, Office 2010 remains a top priority. Just as important, businesses are also adopting our productivity server applications including Lync, SharePoint and Exchange, either on-premise or in the cloud with Office 365. The early success of Office 365 has surpassed our expectations. Businesses around the world, and of all sizes, are making the commitment to Microsoft’s cloud services. 
Our business infrastructure offerings, including Windows Server, Hyper-V and System Center, are a top priority for enterprises. The flexibility, performance, scalability, and price advantage of our private cloud products uniquely meet the needs of the market. And with Windows Azure, we enable our customers to build new applications and extend their existing private cloud assets to the public cloud.
As we discussed at our Financial Analyst Meeting, we are increasingly delivering integrated experiences across multiple devices, from the phone to the Xbox and TV and to the PC. Earlier this month, we launched an updated version of our Windows Phone operating system with a broad array of new features and services, including enhanced integration with Bing, Xbox LIVE and Office 365. With Nokia, Samsung and other devices coming to market, we are well positioned to become the third mobile ecosystem. 
In the living room, we continue to differentiate the entertainment experience for Xbox users around the world, and we recently announced partnerships with nearly 40 leading TV and entertainment providers. Powered by Kinect and voice search through Bing, users will be able to easily search and enjoy content from a large collection of content providers through their Xbox 360 consoles. And on the PC, Windows 7 is the operating system of choice for almost half a billion people around the world. Combined with the innovative hardware being brought to market by our OEM partners this holiday season, Windows will continue to deliver the great experiences that people want.  
During the quarter, we unveiled the developer preview of the next version of our PC operating system. Windows 8 creates a modern platform designed for a new generation of hardware experiences enabled by touch and a diversity of chip architectures. In Search, monetization of our ad platform remains below our expectations, and we continue to partner closely with Yahoo! to address the platform gaps and inefficiencies. We recently agreed to extend the RPS guarantee payments to Yahoo! reflecting the strength of our partnership and our continued commitment and optimism about the financial opportunity ahead of us.
Last week, we reached a significant milestone with the closing of our acquisition of Skype. We welcome Skype employees into the Microsoft family. And we welcome the over 170 million people who rely on Skype for their voice and video calls on a monthly basis. Now that the deal is closed, we are starting the integration of Skype’s world-class services and global-networked platform across our portfolio of products and services including Lync, Windows Live Messenger, Windows Phone and the Xbox platform.  Together, we will redefine social and real-time communications for consumers and businesses around the world.
In summary, we are off to a good start to the year. Customer demand across the breadth of our product portfolio was healthy, and we remain focused on our strategic investments and partnerships that will help drive future growth. 
With that, I’m going to hand it back to Bill to provide more details on our results.
Bill Koefoed
Thanks, Peter. First, I'm going to review our overall results and then move on to the details by business segment. Revenue for the quarter was $17.4 billion, up $1.2 billion or 7% year-over-year. Operating income was $7.2 billion, cash flow from operations was $8.5 billion and earnings per share was $0.68, an increase of 10%. 
Foreign exchange did not materially impact our net income during the quarter. Coming off a record Q4, enterprise demand for our products remained strong, and our customers continued to add both products and seats to their enterprise agreements. At the end of the quarter, unearned revenue was $15.7 billion, and our contracted not billed remained over $18.5 billion. 
Turning to the PC market, we estimate that the overall market grew 1% to 3%. Within that, PC sales to emerging markets continued to outpace developed markets. Business PCs grew 5% to a quarterly record of almost 35 million PCs. And consumer PCs were flat, primarily impacted by weakness in netbook sales. 
Now I'll move on to the results for the Windows and Windows Live Division, where revenue was up 2% and grew in line with the PC market. As usual, you'll find the OEM revenue bridge in our earnings slide deck. Overall, the Windows business continued to show momentum. During the quarter, we surpassed 450 million copies of Windows 7 sold since launch, and enterprise deployments of Windows 7 progressed. This quarter, OEM licenses grew 4%, and within that, business licenses grew 6%. 
While we have seen the cannibalization of netbooks, sales of Windows licenses on traditional consumer PCs showed healthy growth of 14%. 
As we look towards the holiday season, we are particularly excited about the lineup of impressive Ultrabooks that will be in market from our OEM partners. 
Now I'll move on to the Microsoft Business Division where revenue grew 8%. Consumer revenue increased 7%, despite difficult comps from the year ago launch of Office 2010. The business transactional portion grew 3%, driven by strong attach in developed markets, partially offset by the impact of PC geographical market mix. The multiyear licensing portion of the business grew 9%. 
Collaboration and communication continued to be a pillar of strength to our Office business. Lync, SharePoint and Exchange collectively grew double digits. Lync revenue grew over 25% as customers increasingly chose Microsoft for their voice and video rollouts. We are focused on the opportunities in this large and growing market. 
With Skype's highly engaged users spending an average of 125 minutes per month, we're particularly excited about the role Skype can play in connecting individuals and businesses together with voice and video. 
Last quarter, we announced the launch of Office 365, the latest version of our cloud-based productivity platform. We are thrilled with the early results. In the first 10 weeks of Office 365 availability, the number of new customers exceeded what took us over 2 years to build with the first version of our business productivity online service. 
Also, we've seen Office 365 customers buy more products and drive new revenue streams. For example, when we've won a competitive bid in the enterprise for messaging and email, 80% of the new customers have bought SharePoint and Lync, in addition to Exchange. 
And historically, small businesses have only bought Office. But today with Office 365, 80% of the time, we've seen them buy the bundle of SharePoint, Lync and Exchange. 
Now let's move on to Server & Tools, which posted 10% revenue growth and grew faster than the server market. Our multiyear license revenue continued to perform well and grew double digits this quarter. Enterprise Services revenue was up 17%. 
Windows Server premium and System Center revenues grew mid-teens as the buildout of private cloud environments and the virtualization of data centers has increased server density and has shifted buying behaviors toward our premium enterprise offering. 
Our data platform business also continued to perform well. SQL Server premium revenue grew nearly 20% this quarter as customers increasingly look to SQL Server to power their business intelligence and mission-critical workloads. 
We continue to build on our strong Server & Tools portfolio. At our BUILD Developer Conference in September, we took the wraps off Windows Server 8, the next major release of the world's most used server operating system, which will be cloud-optimized to work in both private and hybrid cloud scenarios. 
In addition, we highlighted our data platform with the upcoming release of SQL Server 2012. We also announced our plans to support Apache Hadoop, both on Windows Azure and Windows Server to embrace big data. 
Next, I'll move to the Online Services Division, where revenue grew 19%. Online advertising revenue was up nearly 21%, driven primarily by search. Bing's U.S. organic market share ended the quarter at 14.7%, up 30 basis points this quarter and 350 basis points year-over-year. This quarter, we made progress in differentiating our offering by deepening Bing's social integration with Facebook and Twitter and made enhancements that simplify decision-making and task-completion.
While Online Services improved its year-over-year operating performance, we continued to face monetization challenges which we are partnering closely with Yahoo! to resolve. 
Now let me move to the Entertainment & Devices Division where revenue grew 9%, and we continued our leadership of the U.S. console market. Gears of War 3, which is only available on Xbox, effectively kicked off the holiday season and sold 3 million units in its first week of release. Gaming is an important component of living room entertainment, and in addition to blockbusters such as Forza 4, Dance Central 2, Halo Anniversary and Kinect Sports Season 2, there will be over 70 Kinect titles available for the holidays. 
Beyond gaming, next quarter is also when nearly 35 million Xbox LIVE users will begin to enjoy the new television content and experiences from our announced partnerships. 
During the quarter, we released the updated version of Windows Phone to market, and it has received favorable reviews from both industry press and our customers. We also signed a broad agreement with Samsung that includes increased collaboration on the development and marketing of Windows Phones. 
Now let me cover the remainder of the income statement. Cost of goods sold was driven by the following: First, we saw an increase in royalty costs resulting from strong transactional sales on Xbox LIVE and the increased sales of royalty-bearing Xbox 360 games, notably Gears of War 3. Second, Enterprise Services continued to grow rapidly. And third, online service costs increased, which included Yahoo! traffic acquisition costs. 
Operating expenses were $6.4 billion, an increase of 8%, primarily due to compensation changes, legal expenses and Puerto Rican excise taxes. 
In the first quarter, we increased our dividend to $0.20, an increase of 25%, and we returned $2.7 billion to shareholders in buybacks and dividends. 
So in summary, we saw broad-based strength in our businesses and got off to a good start to the year, both in revenue and EPS. And with that, I will hand it back to Peter, who's going to discuss our business outlook.
Peter S. Klein
Thanks, Bill. For the remainder of the call, I'll discuss our expectations for the second quarter and full year, beginning with the Windows and Windows Live Divisions. We expect revenue to continue to be impacted by market dynamics similar to what we experienced in the past several quarters, with PC growth in emerging markets significantly outpacing growth in developed markets. 
Turning to the Microsoft Business Division. Transactional revenue, approximately 40% of the division's total, will likely lag the overall PC market for both the second quarter and full fiscal year, reflecting a higher mix of PC shipments to emerging markets and the prior-year launch impact. 
In addition, when updating your models, remember that last year, we recognized $224 million of revenue related to the Office 2010 Tech Guarantee. 
Multiyear licensing revenue, approximately 60% of the division's total, should grow mid- to high-single digits for the second quarter and low double digits for the full fiscal year. 
Moving to Server & Tools. Approximately 30% of the division's revenue comes from transactional licensing, 50% from multiyear licensing and 20% from Enterprise Services. For the second quarter and full fiscal year, we expect transactional revenue to generally track with the hardware market. Multiyear licensing revenue should grow low double digits, and Enterprise Services revenue should grow about 20%. 
Turning to the Online Services Division. We are focused on improving the financial performance of our Search business. Our #1 priority is to resolve the monetization challenges of the combined ad platform. We are working very closely with Yahoo! on bridging the RPS gap. As we improve RPS, revenue should track the online advertising market more closely. 
Moving onto the Entertainment & Devices Division. Including Skype, we now expect revenue to grow low double digits for the second quarter and high teens for the full fiscal year. 
Switching to overall cost of goods sold for the company. We expect COGS growth to have similar dynamics to what we experienced the past 3 quarters. Growth will be driven by increased Xbox console sales, Xbox LIVE royalty costs, the inclusion of Skype, Enterprise Services and online costs, including Yahoo! traffic acquisition costs. We have adjusted our fiscal year operating expense guidance to include Skype and the associated integration costs. As a result, we now expect operating expenses to be $28.6 billion to $29.2 billion for the full fiscal year. 
We expect our effective tax rate to be 19% to 21% for the second quarter and full fiscal year, and we still expect capital expenditures to be about $2.5 billion for the full fiscal year. 
For the second quarter, we expect unearned revenue to roughly follow historical seasonal patterns. We continue to expect unearned revenue at the end of the fiscal year to grow low double digits compared to the prior fiscal year. 
As I discussed at our Financial Analyst Meeting last month, we have a balanced approach to capital allocation: investing in growth, returning cash to shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. We are investing in the significant growth opportunities we see for our businesses by building integrated products that deliver a differentiated value proposition and accelerating our growth in compelling scenarios like real-time communications with the acquisition of Skype. 
We will also continue to return cash to shareholders. This quarter, we increased our dividend 25%, and we are continuing our $40 billion share repurchase program approved by the board of directors in 2008, of which $11.2 billion remain. 
In summary, our financial results this quarter build upon an already strong financial foundation, one that provides stability while at the same time giving us the flexibility to take advantage of growth opportunities. And with that, I'll turn it back to Bill, and we'll take some questions.
Bill Koefoed
Thanks, Peter. [Operator Instructions] Carol, can you please go ahead and repeat your instructions?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Adam Holt, Morgan Stanley.
Adam H. Holt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
My question is about Skype. Is 100% of the Skype revenue going to be in the E&D segment? And if it is, it looks like the revenue and earnings contribution or OpEx contribution is a little bit lower than I would have expected. Are there any write-downs or any shifts or any kind of transitional issues that we should be thinking about in terms of the run rate for Skype, relative to what it was historically?
Peter S. Klein
Well, there's going to be integration associated costs, some amortization of IP, things like that, that you may or may not be considering. But yes, it'll all appear in E&D.
Operator
The next question is from Rick Sherlund, Nomura.
Richard G. Sherlund - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
On Skype, Peter, can you just talk a little bit about the model for Skype? What are you going to do different to get the revenues up? How do you monetize Skype? And then also just on Ultrabooks, you had that issue in Thailand with the floods that Western Digital said is going to take out a lot of production. Are you anticipating any problem in PCs? And maybe that shifts the market over to solid-state, and these Ultrabooks look kind of interesting. Any reasonable leads that we could see some actual acceleration in the market from adoption of Ultrabooks? Or are you thinking we might see some slowdown because of what we've seen in Thailand?
Peter S. Klein
Let me -- I'll start with the Skype question, and then we'll get to the other question. Obviously, we -- the first thing I'll say is we closed the deal last week, so we're real-time doing a lot of the great work on the product integration planning. We've got folks here sort of in the building as we speak really working hard on what the plans are going to be, and so I think, over time, it will become more clear. I think as we've been talking about since we announced the acquisition, the opportunities are incredibly exciting across the portfolio of our products, whether it's Lync or Windows Live Messenger or Xbox or on the phone. And so I think not only are there great opportunities to integrate across our product portfolio but, as they were working on even before we announced the acquisition, new revenue opportunities related to advertising and premium services, so all of that's coming together as we speak. And mostly, we're incredibly excited to get to work together more fully now that the deal has closed. In terms of your question about Thailand, first thing I want to say, obviously, is our thoughts go out to all the individuals that are affected there, and we're thinking about them. In terms of the impact of that, you're correct, it doesn't impact solid-state, which is good. And I would say this about, overall, the impact. I think, historically, the global supply chain has been pretty resilient to occurrences like this. And so over time, we'll have to watch this very carefully to see kind of what the overall impact is.
Operator
The next question is from Heather Bellini, Goldman Sachs.

Peter, I was just wondering, the Windows attach and inventory boost was a nice tick up this quarter. And I'm just wondering, is it -- if you could kind of give us a sense of how you're doing from a piracy standpoint in terms of the -- in terms of that's what helped the quarter, did you actually see more inventory build?
Peter S. Klein
We saw both. So with some inventory and some attach, we're definitely seeing improvements in attach sort of across-the-board, so definitely making some improvements on piracy, and then some of that improvement was a little bit of inventory build as we head into the holiday. But to your point, we are definitely seeing improvements in attach this quarter, which was a big driver.

Bill, I'm wondering, as you look at the OSD loss this year, you actually lost less money than we thought on a revenue number that was lower. Just first wondering if you could comment going forward if we should expect that this level of losses is what we should sustain. And then as you look at the model overall, we saw lower losses, but that didn't flow through as much to the bottom line as we might have expected. How are you thinking about any upside that comes through the lower losses in OSD and impacting the bottom line and the company overall?
Peter S. Klein
As we've been saying, the key to this profitability of this business is to continue to grow our revenue, and to do that, we have to continue to grow share and grow our revenue for Search, and that's certainly what we're focused on. Obviously, it's a high fixed-cost business. Within that, we have been managing the expenses, and so we are taking every opportunity to manage the profitability of that business, but by far, the most important thing to continue to increase the profitability is to make sure we can continue to grow the revenue, and to do that, we need to make sure we get the revenue for Search up. So that's what we're laser focused on. That's what we've got people working closely with Yahoo! on every day, and we'll continue to focus on that, and that's the most leveraged thing we can do for OSD profitability and, ultimately, the company's bottom line.

Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Just wanted to drill into the Skype contribution a little bit more. Just wondering if there are some products you're going to be discontinuing, certain services or new things, conversely, that you're going to be adding. And also this onetime transition-type expenses, Peter, if you could quantify how much of that will impact the P&L that you've already guided to in the quarter just to get an understanding of how much will go away as you settle into a steady state on the Skype business.
Peter S. Klein
Clearly, it's a little premature to talk about sort of changes and what we're going to do with the products. As I said, mostly, we've seen this week is an incredibly excitement with their engineering people and our engineering people getting together to talk about all the opportunities. As we flesh those plans out, obviously, we'll have a lot more to say about that. And in terms of the expense side, what I would say is everything that's included there is included in our guidance framework that we gave you, so that's probably the best guidance I can give you on those expenses.

Just wanted to focus back on MBD. You guys have been trending at or above, frankly, the PC shipments for several quarters now. Where do you think we stand in just sort of the adoption cycle, particularly in a large enterprise of Office 2010, and especially when we think about rolling sort of the ecosystem out? Where are we in that? And also, Bill, just one quick follow-up. I think you gave the transactional revenue growth for MBD, but I'm not sure if you gave that for Server & Tools.
Peter S. Klein
Yes, on the last question, the transactional revenue for Server & Tools should track the hardware market.
Philip Winslow - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Sorry, I meant this quarter.
Peter S. Klein
This quarter, sorry. I'll answer the question. On MBD, it's really interesting. There's a couple of things going on, particularly in the enterprise that really provide sustenance for the ongoing business. One is the great sort of traction we get from the integration of SharePoint and Exchange and Lync with Office 2010. So not only is there really good resonance for the Office application, but increasingly, as Bill talked about, customers are deploying communications and collaboration technology with that. And there is a lot of legs to go on the productivity server applications piece of the business. Second thing I would add is the cloud. Increasingly, every time we go in and talk to enterprises about productivity, they want to have a conversation about public cloud services, not necessarily because they want to deploy public cloud tomorrow, but they really want to understand the roadmap and understand where that's leading, and we found that creates an incredibly good conversation that then leads to a broader conversation of a long-term commitment to our platform and applications. And I think, obviously, that's a long-term phenomenon with a lot of room still to go. So the way I think about it, yes, for the Office application, particularly on the transactional side, coming off of launch here, there's some difficult comparables. But on the enterprise side, with the additional products and the cloud, that's really been the driver of our growth, and it is really a long-term catalyst.
Bill Koefoed
And Phil, transactional for STB was low-single digits, which we believe was roughly in line with the server hardware market, as Peter mentioned.

Brendon Barnicle, Pacific Crest Securities.
Brendon Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division
I had 2 quick ones on the guidance. Peter, first on the Windows and Windows Live. In the previous quarters, you've talked about business PCs no longer outpacing consumer. That language isn't in. Is that no longer as big a factor? And then second, on the Server & Tools, you've pretty substantially increased your guidance around the Enterprise Services revenue. Wondering what's accounting for that uptick, and we saw good strength in that in the quarter as well.
Peter S. Klein
Yes, we are still seeing business outpacing consumer, so thank you for that. And on the Enterprise Services, it's interesting, we're really seeing healthy demand for our consulting services to help people architect and deploy sort of the next generation of the products that we're bringing to market, both in Server & Tools and MBD. You can see the connection there, right, Server & Tools continuing to grow double digits. People are really investing in their data centers and in the private cloud, and we're helping people do that and also think about and contemplate what that's going to mean to migrate to the public cloud ultimately. Same thing is true with the productivity server applications. How do you start deploying Lync and SharePoint? How do you think about transitioning to Office 365 over time? So we're really seeing -- we've got a strong pipeline of business there, and that's why you're seeing the growth, both in the cost, frankly, to service demand because, obviously, it's a variable cost business.

Brent Thill, UBS.
Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Peter, just on the enterprise business, any changes in customer behavior as the quarter progressed? Or as you look at your pipeline, I think there's obviously been some concern over some more scrutiny around some larger deal sizes. Was just curious in terms of what you're seeing.
Peter S. Klein
No, we didn't see any changes in that flavor throughout the quarter.
Bill Koefoed
And I would just add, I mean, unearned came in kind of right in line with our expectations, so we continue to execute well on the annuity side for sure.
Operator
Mark Moerdler, Bernstein.
Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
Want to drill in a little bit on the hosting costs, which on MBD was a big chunk of the increase in cost of revenue. How much do you think this is pointing to a lower margin? Has Office 365 and Dynamics Online gained traction? If so, what do you think we should be modeling against?
Peter S. Klein
Yes, no, a great question. Obviously, specifically in the short run, delivering a service has a different margin profile than delivering software. It's going to have a lower gross margin percentage but, ultimately, should have a higher gross profit dollar. So what you should be thinking about is as we scale, you see accelerated revenue growth at a lower gross margin percentage and a higher gross profit dollars.
Bill Koefoed
But I would add, we're such in early days there that I don't think it's had a big impact on our business performance to date.
Peter S. Klein
That is correct. That was a long-term business model perspective, but it's not material today.

John DiFucci, JPMC.
John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Peter, I think bookings were flat this quarter from a year ago, and I assume you got some benefits from foreign exchange, so on a constant currency basis, they were probably down a little bit. This is after some 4 quarters of some really nice growth here. I think the last time it was flat or down was during the recession. Is this simply a sign of some difficult macro -- of a difficult macro environment? Or was it just a difficult comp year-over-year or even a strong quarter last quarter that might have pulled some business forward?
Peter S. Klein
Exactly. It's definitely more of the latter. Across-the-board, all of our metrics for revenue, transactional, unearned, CMBs, all what we expected, and it's really just a function of sort of the year-over-year comps and the strong Q4 that we had, and we're excited about the pipeline as we head into Q2. And as you know, Q1 is probably our lowest sort of selling quarter anyway during the year seasonally. So we feel good as we head into Q2.
Bill Koefoed
Well, and we reflected that in our unearned guidance that we gave you last quarter, which was we expected sequential kind of Q4 to Q1 but sequential -- sequentially, it would decline a little bit more than normal. So I'd say, it kind of came in line with what we had expected it to be, as I said earlier.

Peter S. Klein
Yes, of our cash, about $51 billion is offshore.
Colin Gillis - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division
Okay. And what percentage of cash do you need to keep onshore just to keep the lights on and the dividends getting paid?
Peter S. Klein
Yes, that's not how we think about it. We've got plenty of cash. It's not an issue.

Brad Reback, Oppenheimer.
Brad Reback - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division
Peter, as we think about the Xbox LIVE business, you've greatly expanded the content available there. Are there opportunities here for additional premium service contracts with people? Or is it going to be mainly transactional to get that content?
Peter S. Klein
Well, without being specific about this particular case, I think from a business model perspective, you're thinking about it right. There's lots of opportunities to think about how you might monetize delivering unique and compelling entertainment experiences, and that's clearly kind of how we think about it. That's sort of been the strategy with Xbox business all along, right? Once you get that incredible installed base of engaged users, how can you deliver a set of interactive entertainment experiences sort of across-the-board and what that means, and sort of from a business model perspective, there's lots of interesting ways to monetize that.
Bill Koefoed
Yes, I mean, I would just add, as you've seen in our results, the Xbox LIVE has been phenomenal, both in terms of growth of users, growth in revenues. The content that we have coming out this holiday season is going to be super exciting, and obviously, as I mentioned in my remarks, that we're going to have over 70 games out this holiday season. So we believe that we have the most compelling entertainment experience in the living room. And hopefully, for those of you who don't have it, you should go out and check it out this holiday season because it's going to be pretty exciting.

I just had a follow-up to Adam's question. You raised your guidance, Peter, for the EDD business this year to high teens growth although, of course, it now includes Skype. So a couple of questions around that. First, do you still expect to see mid-teens growth for the EDD business organically? And second, I don't know that there are that many long-term Skype subscribers, but is there going to be a deferred revenue write-down for Skype? And if so, how much?
Peter S. Klein
I think it's -- why don't we -- the second question, we'll talk to you about when we actually report Skype results after the next quarter because we disclosed that last week. And I -- on the E&D business, I would say generally, yes, our guidance is in line with guidance we've given before.

A follow-on question to Brendon's comment about business PCs growing faster than, I think, consumer PCs. Where do you think we are in the enterprise Windows 7 upgrade cycle? Are we middle innings, we getting towards the end? How do you feel about that?
Peter S. Klein
Yes, no, I think we're middle innings. I think we expect that dynamic of business PCs growing faster to last throughout this fiscal year at least, so I would say middle innings.

Since fixing the Yahoo! RPS challenges, obviously an issue for improving OSD, how do you guys go about sort of ensuring that there won't be any disruption to your efforts, given all of the, call it, market talk about what's happening with Yahoo!? Because clearly if it's a quieter [ph] split-up, there's also sorts of potential outcomes that could cause maybe more disruption to what you're trying to accomplish. So how do you kind of preserve the process, if you will?
Peter S. Klein
We've got a really good relationship with Yahoo!. This is a long-term alliance. Everybody is working really well together. We're super focused on what we need to do, and no matter what, that's the goal at hand. And the teams are working really well together to do that. So that's kind of how we're approaching it and focused on it.

Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2011 Microsoft Corp. Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Bill Koefoed, General Manager of Investor Relations. Bill, you may begin.
Bill Koefoed
Thank you, Carol, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. As usual, with me today are Peter Klein, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel.
On our website is our financial summary slide deck which is intended to follow the flow of our prepared remarks and provide the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. This information is available at microsoft.com/investor. 
As a reminder, we will post today's prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript at the Microsoft Investor Relations website until July 21, 2012.
During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Qs and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
Okay. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Peter.
Peter Klein
Thanks, Bill, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I'm pleased to share with you our financial results for the fourth quarter, which rounded out a solid fiscal year. We closed the year with terrific sales execution, as enterprises furthered their commitment to our Windows, Office and Server products. Customers continued to invest in our Business Desktop offerings, including Windows 7, where enterprise deployments have increased almost 50% since March. Our overall multiyear licensing business was especially strong, driven by attach of additional seats and additional products. As a result, fourth quarter bookings were up 17%. 
As I look back on fiscal year '11, we delivered strong financial results and products while making strategic investments and alliances that will allow us to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities. We grew fiscal year '11 revenues double digits and we delivered another year of operating margin expansion. We also grew earnings per share by more than 20% for the second year in a row. 
Our financial results reflect Office 2010's outstanding market reception. Deployment remains 5x faster than the previous version. Customers are also adding our business productivity applications, including Exchange, SharePoint, Lync and Dynamics to their multiyear agreements. These 4 products collectively drove approximately 30% of the business division's growth this year. 
We made great progress on our cloud initiative this year. We continue to lead the industry through this transformation by enabling our customers to transition to the cloud in a flexible, customized way. Last month, we launched Office 365, the latest generation of our cloud productivity service. With Office 365, we've created new profit growth opportunities for us and our partners while enabling scenarios that weren't viable in the past. 
In the enterprise, Office 365 enables us to increase revenue and profit per seat while strengthening customer commitment through increased product satisfaction and high return on investment. It gives us new opportunities to address the workforce that doesn't regularly use a PC in the workplace. For small and mid-sized businesses, we now offer a productivity solution with simple deployment and low upfront cost. And with 80% of small businesses having never purchased a business productivity application aside from Office, the opportunity for Microsoft and our partners is significant. 
During the year, we made important platform enhancements to Windows Azure, driving increased developer interest and momentum and enabling new scenarios. Companies such as Pixar, Toyota and Boeing have leveraged Azure to develop innovative solutions and enhanced experiences for their customers. At the same time, building private cloud infrastructure remains a top priority for many of our customers, and Windows Server, System Center and SQL Server are scaling with the increased workloads in data centers. 
In search, Bing continues to gain market share. In this quarter, we further differentiated our platform by deepening our relationship with Facebook. During the quarter, we partnered closely with Yahoo! to uncover and address several platform gaps and inefficiencies. We still face monetization challenges and will continue to work closely with Yahoo!. We remain confident in the long-term potential of the combined search marketplace. 
During the year, we reinvigorated our Xbox franchise with a refreshed console and with Kinect, which revolutionized home entertainment and natural user interface technology. We also had great momentum with Xbox Live, which now has approximately 35 million members. Together, these products and services drove record fiscal year revenue and operating income in the Entertainment and Devices division. 
In May, we announced our agreement to acquire Skype, which will extend Skype's world-class brand and global reach of its networked platform, while at the same time enhancing Microsoft's existing portfolio of products and services. With Skype, we will increase the accessibility of real-time video and voice communications to both consumers and enterprises, thereby generating new business and revenue opportunities for Microsoft. 
In summary, we are pleased with the terrific market response to our products and our great sales execution, both of which helped drive our solid financial results for the quarter and full fiscal year. We also continue to be excited by our strategic investments and alliances which will allow us to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities. 
With that, I'm going to hand it back to Bill to provide more details on our results, and then I'll come back to provide some thoughts on our outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2012.
Bill Koefoed
Thanks, Peter. First, I'm going to review our overall results and then move on to the details by business segment. Revenue for the quarter was $17.4 billion, up 8% year-over-year, while bookings were up 17%. For the year, revenue was $69.9 billion, growth of 12%. 
Operating income was $6.2 billion for the quarter, and for the year, a record $27.2 billion, up over $3 billion from the prior year. For the quarter, earnings per share was $0.69. For the year, earnings per share was $2.69, up 28%, the second consecutive year of EPS growth over 20%. 
This quarter, enterprise demand for our products remained strong, and multiyear commitments drove our unearned revenue balance to $17.1 billion. Our contracted not-billed balance is now over $18.5 billion. 
The PC market dynamics were similar to the third quarter. First, the business PC refresh cycle continued and drove estimated business PC growth of 8%. Second, PC sales to emerging markets continued to grow at a rapid pace as a record number of people around the world are using Windows PCs. We estimate that this quarter, over 40 million PCs, representing half of all global PC shipments, were shipped to emerging markets. We estimate the worldwide consumer PC market declined 2%, primarily driven by weakness in developed markets. In total, we estimate the PC market increased 1% to 3% in the fourth quarter. 
Now I'll move on to the results for the Windows and Windows Live division, where revenue was down 1%, reflecting the PC market dynamics I just described. As usual, you'll find the OEM revenue bridge at our earnings slide deck. 
Last week at our Worldwide Partner Conference, we announced that we had sold over 400 million units of Windows 7. 25% of enterprise desktops have already deployed Windows 7, and as we have stated before, over 90% of enterprises have committed to a deployment plan. 
During the quarter, we also provided an update of Windows 8. We demonstrated how we have reimagined Windows for a new generation of touch-centric hardware. You'll hear more at our BUILD developer conference this September. 
Now I'll move on to the Microsoft Business Division, which grew 7%. Consumer revenue declined 8%. The weak consumer PC dynamics in developed markets were partially offset by strong attach rates. The business transactional portion grew 27%, driven primarily by business PC growth and continued launch cycle momentum. The multiyear licensing portion of the business grew 6%. 
We launched Office 2010 one year ago, and for the year, the business division's revenue increased to over $22 billion, an increase of 16%. Lync, SharePoint and Dynamics all continued to grow double digits this quarter. Within our Dynamics business, which grew 19%, we saw strong growth and share gains across products. We added 300,000 new seats on Dynamics CRM, and now, 2 million users leverage Dynamics CRM every day. 
Now let's move on to the Server & Tools business, which posted 12% revenue growth. Transactional revenue grew faster than the underlying server hardware market, which we estimate grew mid-single digits. Multiyear license revenue grew 12%, and Enterprise Services revenue grew 14%. Our premium Windows Server and System Center revenues were both up over 20%. Customers are using Microsoft technology to virtualize their data center and build out private cloud environments. System Center revenue has also grown double digits 10 consecutive quarters. 
We are seeing customers continue to adopt SQL Server as they deploy mission-critical applications and implement cost-effective business intelligence capabilities. As a result, SQL Server Premium revenue grew almost 20%. 
Last week, we previewed Windows Server 8 and the next version of System Center. These products will further enhance customer's private cloud deployments while bridging their investments to the public cloud. We'll also share more details on these at BUILD in September. 
Our cloud computing platform, Windows Azure, continues to have strong customer momentum while revenue growth accelerates. During the quarter, we showcased innovative Azure implementations with Boeing and General Mills, demonstrating the power and flexibility of the platform. 
Next, I'll move to the Online Services division, where revenue grew 17%. Online advertising revenue grew 20%, driven primarily by search. Bing's U.S. organic market share ended the quarter at 14.4%, up 340 basis points from last year. During the quarter, we launched new features based on Facebook's social graph to help people make better, smarter decisions. As Peter mentioned, we continue to experience challenges with RPS, and we are partnering closely with Yahoo! to resolve these as quickly as possible. 
Now let me move to the Entertainment and Devices division, where revenue grew 30%. During the quarter, we sold over 1.7 million consoles, an increase of 18%. Xbox 360 was the #1 selling console in the U.S. for the year. At E3 in June, we announced the upcoming releases of Gears of War 3, Forza 4 [sic] [Forza Motorsport 4], Kinect Star Wars, Kinect Disney Land Adventures, Dance Central 2, Kinect Sports Season 2 and many more games. 
Xbox Live also continues to grow rapidly, and consumer online engagement with the service remains a core part of our Xbox value proposition. Xbox Live has entertainment content from partners such as ESPN, Hulu, Netflix and BSkyB. And this fall, we will make it even easier to find and access content via integration between Kinect and Bing. We believe the combination of these core features will help drive even broader engagement within the Xbox Live ecosystem. 
In May, we previewed Mango, which is our fall release of Windows Phone. Mango will deliver deeper social experiences, multitasking, Office 365 integration and will feature Internet Explorer 9 to optimize the browsing experience. During the quarter, we also signed the Nokia alliance, added several new OEM partners, launched on Verizon and Sprint and saw the number of applications in the marketplace increase 60% sequentially. 
Now let me cover the remainder of the income statement. In the quarter, cost of goods sold increased 17% and had similar drivers as last quarter. Hardware costs are up due to the success of Xbox 360 consoles and Kinect Sensors. Third-party content royalties are also up, reflecting strong sales on Xbox Live. Enterprise Services and our Server & Tools business continues to grow rapidly, and Online Services costs are also up, reflecting increased traffic acquisition costs, including costs related to the Yahoo! alliance. Operating expenses were $7.5 billion, an increase of 8%, primarily due to recently legislated Puerto Rican excise taxes and an increase in selling-related costs. 
During the quarter, we made the following adjustments to our full year tax rate, which impacted our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter. First, we made adjustments to reflect our actual mix of foreign and U.S. taxable income for the year; and second, we completed our tax filings, which resulted in adjustments reducing our tax provision. To think about the full year tax rate, our effective rate was 19.2% after adjusting for the onetime benefit in the third quarter related to the IRS settlement. 
Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $5.9 billion, growth of 6%, while operating cash flow for the full year was a record $27 billion, an increase of 12%. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $1.6 billion of stock and declared $1.3 billion of dividends. For the full year, we returned $16.9 billion of cash, an increase of 10% year-over-year, continuing our long-term commitment to return cash to shareholders. 
In the past 5 years, we have returned over $90 billion and reduced our outstanding share count by 1.7 billion shares or 17%. 
In summary, we had a very solid quarter and year, both from a product perspective and also with regard to delivering strong financial results and returning cash to shareholders. And with that, I'll hand it back to Peter, who's going to discuss our business outlook.
Peter Klein
Thanks, Bill. For the remainder of the call, I'll discuss our expectations for the upcoming quarter and full year. As we enter fiscal year 2012, we are excited by the advancing trends in technology and the resulting opportunities for us to evolve our businesses. We expect increased diversity of hardware and services designed to satisfy users' growing demand for a unified, consistent experience across multiple devices. We also expect businesses and developers to continue their transition to the cloud, given the compelling economics and flexibility. We believe that with our current portfolio and investments, we are well positioned to capitalize on these trends. 
Now turning to our outlook by business. For the Windows and Windows Live division, we expect revenue to continue to be impacted by market dynamics, similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter, with emerging market growth significantly outpacing developed market growth. While emerging markets are an important opportunity for us to increase Windows penetration, they impact revenue growth percentages as they generate lower average selling prices and have higher piracy rates. We also expect business PC growth to outpace consumer PC growth, with the business PC refresh cycle continuing throughout the fiscal year. 
Turning to the Microsoft Business division. Transactional revenue, approximately 40% of the division's total, will likely lag the overall PC market for both the first quarter and full fiscal year, reflecting a higher mix of PC shipments to emerging markets and the launch of Office 2010 a year ago. Multiyear licensing revenue, approximately 60% of the division's total, should grow mid to high single digits for the first quarter and low double digits for the full fiscal year. 
Moving to Server & Tools. Approximately 30% of the division's revenue comes from transactional licensing, 50% from multiyear licensing and 20% from Enterprise Services. We expect transactional revenue to generally track with the hardware market for the first quarter and full fiscal year. We expect multiyear licensing revenue and Enterprise Services revenue to grow low double-digits for the first quarter and full fiscal year. 
Turning to the Online Services division. We expect online advertising revenue to perform roughly in line with the overall online advertising market for the first quarter and full fiscal year. 
Within the Entertainment and Devices division, we expect revenue to grow high single digits for the first quarter and mid-teens for the full fiscal year. Keep in mind that first quarter revenue will include a higher mix of hardware, reflecting last September's Halo Reach launch, and will result in gross margins similar to full fiscal year '11 margin. 
Switching to overall cost of goods sold for the company. The biggest factor impacting COGS going forward will be the shift of revenue mix across hardware, software, Enterprise Services and Online Services. In fiscal year '12, we will continue to prioritize our spending and manage our costs. We are reconfirming our guidance of 3% to 5% growth and expect operating expenses to be $28.0 billion to $28.6 billion for the full fiscal year. We expect our effective tax rate to be 19% to 21% for the first quarter and full fiscal year, and we still expect capital expenditures for the full fiscal year to be about $2.5 billion. 
Moving to unearned revenue. Given our strong sales execution and our record unearned balance at the end of the fiscal year, unearned revenue in the first quarter will likely lag historical sequential growth patterns by a few points. We expect unearned revenue at the end of fiscal year '12 to grow low double-digits over this fiscal year. 
In summary, we delivered solid financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year. As we look towards fiscal year '12, we have good product momentum in the market and are excited by the opportunity to help our customers take advantage of the advancing trends in technology. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill and we'll take some questions.
Bill Koefoed
Thanks, Peter. We want to get to questions from as many of you as possible, so please stick to just one question and avoid long or multi-part questions. Carol, can you please go ahead and repeat your instructions?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question today will be from Walter Pritchard, Citi.
Walter Pritchard - Citigroup Inc
You mentioned in the slide deck there that 20% of the FORTUNE 500 has started to adopt the Office 365 Online Services. And I'm assuming it's pretty early there, but I'm wondering if you could help us understand how quickly you expect that to progress throughout fiscal '12, and sort of what impact we should see on the financial statements as that starts to happen in fiscal '12 or maybe beyond.
Peter Klein
Yes. You see it hit the financial statements in 2 ways actually, Walter. One is will be in the actual Office 365 revenue, but also as we continue to have the conversations about the migration to the cloud, you see that show up in our multiyear licensing revenue, and you saw some of that this quarter with our really strong multiyear licensing revenue across the board. The market response so far has been great. We're really excited about it. We expect that to accelerate over time. But again, I think you'll see it in both ways. You'll see it in our multiyear licensing revenue and in our Office 365 revenue.

The next question will be from Adam Holt, Morgan Stanley.
Adam Holt - Morgan Stanley
My question's about the E&D commentary for next year, which was, I think, a surprise, relative to, certainly, the consensus expectations in that it's a lot higher than where consensus was for next year. Can you talk a little bit about some of the detail behind the assumptions there? Specifically, what are you expecting or what is embedded around the Nokia relationship, and what are you expecting and what's in the numbers around any kind of share gains following Mango?
Peter Klein
Well, the single biggest driver in the E&D division is going to be Xbox, right? And so we've got great momentum in the marketplace with the console, which we've refreshed a year ago, with Kinect which just came to market last holiday, with a bunch of new content and titles that Bill talked about in terms of games as well as broader entertainment content. So as we look to continue the momentum that we have with our share position in the marketplace, you see the strategy really coming together in that business, selling the installed base of the consoles and then having the social connectivity with Xbox Live and the broader entertainment portfolio. And so a lot of that strength relates to the Xbox business. Additionally -- I mean, I think it's fair to say that our division thinks that we've just scratched the surface of the possibilities with both the Xbox console and Kinect. And obviously, as I talked about with the games that we had coming out at Christmas, people are super excited about the possibilities there.
Operator
The next question is from Heather Bellini, Goldman Sachs.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
I just had a quick question. There's been a lot of talk about patents and money that you guys could be receiving for patent violations. How do we think about modeling those, if there's any tips you could give us? And how do we think about those -- where they would show up and kind of what segment they get embedded in?
Peter Klein
I think the most important thing to think about, stepping back, is of our overall approach, right? We have a firm culture and belief in innovation, intellectual property and protecting our right to intellectual property. And we've done that consistently with the industry-wide licensing program related to Android. Specifically, broadly too, but Android, which infringes on some of our patents. I think we haven't talked a lot about what to expect from a modeling perspective on there, so you should just look to what we do on our licensing program going forward.
Operator
The next question is from Philip Winslow, Credit Suisse.
Philip Winslow - Crédit Suisse AG
Just going back to deferred revenue. Obviously, that was well ahead of consensus, and I think it's the strongest year-over-year growth you've had in MBD since '06 and Server & Tools since '08. What really changed this quarter, the second half of the fiscal year that drove that up so much from what we've been seeing over the past couple of years? And just anything specific to those 2 divisions as well.
Peter Klein
Yes. No, there are several things. One, the business refresh has continued as companies have come out of the economic downturn of a few years ago. They really are investing in technology. They're seeing the opportunities for technology to really enhance their value proposition. And they are seeing the benefit of our technology. They're really making a long-term commitment to our product set. In MBD, it's really about intentional strategy we've had really over the last 3 to 5 years to sort of broaden the view of what productivity means and how we integrate, not only the great new Office applications, but also with e-mail, with Exchange, collaboration with SharePoint and more recently, communications with Lync. And customers are really seeing the benefit of that. We're really just starting to scratch the surface on that. As I said on the call, a lot of our revenue was driven by growth in those businesses. And if you add to that what we're doing with Dynamics, in taking share in both ERP and CRM, it really is driving a lot of growth, and that really is sustainable. At the same time, in Server & Tools, we've really scaled our products across the board, whether that's with the premium versions of Windows Server and System Center and also SQL Server. And so as we've done that and customers are investing in their data centers, in their private cloud implementations on the way to the public cloud, we're really taking advantage of that and getting good double-digit growth there. So the combination of a really strong environment for businesses investing in the value of IT and our product set sort of across the board, from infrastructure to applications, has been great.
Operator
The next question is from Brent Thill, UBS.
Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank
Peter, just on enterprise demand. Is there any change in terms of what you're seeing in the U.S. versus European demand profile?
Peter Klein
No. This quarter, we actually saw broad-based demand across all the geographies. Obviously, emerging markets remain very strong. But this quarter, we saw demand and great sales execution really across Europe and the U.S.
Operator
The next question will be from John DiFucci, JPMC.
John DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co
Bill, when you said that 25% of enterprise desktops are already deployed with Windows 7 and 90% of enterprises have committed to a deployment plan, I was just curious. Is it fair to say that about -- that 25%, should we be thinking of those as largely on the lower end, in the SMB that sort of act more like consumers? And does the committed, your word there, ""committed"", does that mean that they're already contracted for, or they've started to contract at the lower level and you expect that to continue going forward?
Peter Klein
Yes, that's a great question. On the enterprise side, clearly, companies like JPMorgan have started looking at Windows 7 and working on the deployment plan. When we think about the term ""committed"", it means that either a Microsoft sales rep or a partner actually have plans in place where they're looking at a rollout schedule. So it's a very deliberate plan. They're engaged in testing. In many cases, I think we talked about that last quarter, but not so much this quarter, they're also rolling out Office 2010 at the same time that they're rolling out the Windows 7 Desktop. So we're excited obviously about the speed of the deployment process that's been underway, but we also think there's a lot of opportunity for the future. And I think to your point probably, enterprises are a little bit further along just due to the -- probably the macroeconomic environment. And we've seen more deliberate execution there than maybe in some of the other areas. That's a great question.
Operator
The next question is from Robert Breza, RBC Capital Markets.
Robert Breza - RBC Capital Markets, LLC
Peter, I was wondering if you could talk to, I think, your comment, you said that you believed unearned revenue could grow low double digits. I'm assuming most of that's going to be coming on the enterprise side. And you specifically called out in your commentary some of the drivers to that growth. Could you maybe just help us clarify that in terms of the unearned revenue?
Peter Klein
Yes, you're correct. Most of that growth will come from the enterprise, and it goes back to that strength we're seeing in selling multiyear licensing agreements and the demand we're seeing for the product set across the portfolio of the Business Division and the Server & Tools business. So the dynamics that we saw this past quarter, we see playing out again next year, and that will drive the unearned growth for the full year. I would add, and I talked about this a little earlier but I'll go back to it again, the conversations increasingly that we're having with the cloud, whether that's Office 365 or Windows Azure or Windows Intune or Dynamics CRM Online, really play into that as well because we find increasingly, customers wanting to make long-term commitments when they see that migration path to the cloud as well. And that, you'll see coming to, I think, even more play this year.
Bill Koefoed
Yes. I think communicating our roadmap to our customers has been a big advantage. And they like our roadmap, they're committed to our roadmap, and that's been a really good thing.
Operator
Brad Reback, Oppenheimer.
Brad Reback - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.
Peter, on the revenue per search aspect towards Yahoo!, can you give us any sense how far along the road you are there? Do you think you're 30% of the way to getting the problem solved?
Peter Klein
That's a good question. What we think and what we say and what we believe is we're on a path and we're totally aligned with Yahoo! on this, and the collaboration has been fantastic and the right people are focused on it, is we'll have this turned around by the end of this calendar year and move forward from there. And we're still on a path to do that, and I think both sides are signed up for that plan.
Operator
The next question is from Colin Gillis from BGC.
Colin Gillis - BGC Partners, Inc.
Peter, just on that same theme in Online Services, can you give us a sense what percent of the expense is ongoing costs and then what percent might be transition costs that could possibly roll off?
Peter Klein
The bulk of it's ongoing cost. There's a little bit of transition cost, but you should think of the bulk of it is ongoing cost. And really, the dynamics of that business, as you know, are -- it's a high fixed-cost business, it's a scaled business, and as we grow our revenue per search, that's a highly leveraged revenue dollar that we get. It goes against that fixed cost base.
Bill Koefoed
So clearly, improving our RPS is our goal that we're laser-focused on as we've talked about.
Peter Klein
Completely.
Operator
Brendan Barnicle, Pacific Crest Securities.
Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc.
Peter, how should we think about repatriation of cash as you guys generate so much in some of these foreign jurisdictions?
Peter Klein
Well, the broader issue of just income tax policy, we'll leave to the experts. Obviously, we're supportive of long-term enhancements to our income tax policy. In terms of repatriation specifically, I don't think it's a big issue one way or the other for either our operations or our strategies or what we're able to do. We've obviously had a very good year both in terms of our financial results and our ability to deliver cash back to shareholders.
Operator
Ed Maguire, CLSA.
Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.
Could you discuss the monetization trends you may be seeing from Xbox Live? Seems like you've got some decent subscriber growth.
Peter Klein
Yes. No, it's really been fantastic. As we've grown the subscriber base, there's actually a couple of revenue streams. There's the subscription revenue stream and then there's the transactional revenue stream for people who actively engage with the service that they can buy purchases while they're engaged in that. And that really helps to accelerate the monetization of that business. And that's a really, really amazing long-term opportunity for us, particularly as we continue to take share of just the whole console platform.
Operator
The next question will be from Gregg Moskowitz from Cowen and Company.
Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC
Peter, I just had a question on guidance. In the past, you've talked about Windows revenue growth roughly tracking PC unit growth. We all know about the mix shift to emerging markets, but is there anything you can say to help frame how we should think about the gap between Windows revenue growth and overall PC growth in fiscal '12?
Peter Klein
Yes. I think I would stick with the framework that we gave, and it's -- there's hopefully a lot of texture to that. And depending on one -- what assumption one makes about the growth in emerging markets versus developed markets and businesses versus consumers really impacts what that growth will be. Obviously, the more faster growth there is in emerging markets relative to developed, is more headwind for the Windows growth relative to the overall PC market. But I think understanding what your belief is about those dynamics should help a lot with that.
Operator
The final question will be from Tim Klasell, Stifel, Nicolaus.
Tim Klasell - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Office 365 has now been out in the market for a little while. Can you -- but you have multiple bundles at very wide price points. Can you sort of point to a bundle or the bundles that appear to be the most popular right now?
Peter Klein
Well, it's been out for about a month, so it's really too early to tell. But I would say that the philosophy behind that pricing is to provide the right set of choices for every customer in every segment, depending on what their needs are. And so ultimately, I think we'll see a broad cross-section of customers choosing different pricing plans, whether you're a small and medium business who's never had Exchange or SharePoint or Lync before, there's a really affordable option for you to jump in. For enterprises who need much more scalability, who need premium versions, they can pay a little bit more. And so as always, we really believe in understanding what the different needs are, different customer segments, in structuring our SKUs and our pricing to reflect the best options for every customer segment depending on their need.

Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2011 Microsoft Corporation's Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Now I would like to turn the call over to Bill Koefoed, General Manager of Investor Relations. Bill, please proceed.
Bill Koefoed
Thank you, Bobbi. And thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. As usual, with me today are Peter Klein, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel. 
Today, we filed our Form 10-Q. In addition, we posted our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck to our Investor Relations
Website at microsoft.com/investor. The slide deck is intended to follow the flow of our prepared remarks and provides a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. As a reminder, we will post today's prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available.
Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript at the Microsoft Investor Relations website until April 28, 2012. 
During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
Okay. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Peter.
Peter Klein
Thanks, Bill. Good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, we again delivered solid financial results, reflecting strong business and consumer demand for our products and services. Despite a mixed PC environment, the breadth and depth of our portfolio drove another quarter of double-digit revenue and earnings per share growth. 
On the commercial side, we saw strong multiyear licensing commitments by enterprises and robust transactional sales, particularly to small and medium businesses. Let me give more color on these. 
On the business desktop, customers continued to embrace our offering. Not only is Office 2010 the fastest-selling version of Office in our company's history, but businesses are purchasing our entire productivity platform, including SharePoint, Exchange, Dynamics and Lync. And with the recently released public beta of Office 365, the next generation of our cloud productivity service, we are enabling new scenarios that weren't viable in the past, especially for small and mid-sized businesses. Office 365 eases deployment for our customers while lowering their upfront costs and provides significantly better returns on investment. 
Enterprises are investing in our business infrastructure offerings, with a growing preference for our premium products. Windows Server, SQL Server and our management tools are enabling our customers to transform their data centers to be more efficient. 
Companies are reaping the benefits that Windows 7 brings, including enhanced productivity, efficiency, security and manageability. Enterprise deployments of Windows 7 have more than doubled over the past 6 months. While business PC shipments showed strength this quarter, consumer PCs declined. Within both segments, emerging markets continued to be an area of strong growth. 
As demonstrated by Bing's continued market share gains since its launch, we have made great strides in relevancy and design and continue to transform search beyond just queries to task completion and decision making. While we are pleased with the progress we have made with Bing, there is significant work ahead to improve the monetization of the combined Yahoo! and Bing marketplace. Advertisers are seeing strong ROI, but revenue per search is below our expectations. We have our best search technical leadership on this issue, and we are partnering closely with Yahoo! to improve monetization as quickly and efficiently as possible. 
Turning to our Entertainment and Devices division, in November, we took the first step in creating a new mobile ecosystem by launching Windows Phone 7. In this quarter, we took the next step by entering into a broad strategic alliance with Nokia. Together, Nokia and Microsoft will innovate with greater speed and provide enhanced opportunities for users and partners to share in the success of the new ecosystem. 
Consumers are delighted with Kinect, as well as our entire Xbox 360 platform for the revolutionary experience it brings to their living room. Kinect continues to lead the way forward in gaming and is opening the door for new scenarios to take advantage of natural user interface. 
So in summary, the breadth and depth of our product portfolio, combined with prioritization of investments and our continued focus on operating expense management, allowed us to deliver another quarter of strong financial results. 
With that, I'm going to hand it back to Bill to provide more details on this quarter's results. And then I'll come back and provide some thoughts on our outlook for our fourth quarter and the next fiscal year.
Bill Koefoed
Thanks, Peter. Revenue for the quarter was $16.4 billion, 13% growth year-over-year, and earnings per share was $0.61, up 36%. Adjusting for Tech Guaranteed programs, this was our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth and our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth. 
Operating cash flow for the third quarter was a record $8.7 billion or growth of 17%. Operating cash flow year-to-date has surpassed $21 billion, an increase of $2.6 billion. Many of the demand trends in the third quarter were similar to the first half of the year. Specifically, Office 2010, Xbox and Xbox Live and Kinect continue to enjoy exceptional consumer momentum. 
On the commercial side, enterprise demand for our products remains strong. Businesses are deploying Microsoft platforms and applications, including Windows, Windows Server, Office, Dynamics and Management Tools. The business demand is translating into healthy increases in transactional licensing and strong enterprise agreement renewals. Our unearned revenue balance grew 6% to $13 billion, reflecting continued strength in our customers' multiyear commitment. Our contracted not billed balance is now over $17 billion, growing approximately 20%. Bookings for the company were up 8%. 
Now let me turn to the PC market. There are 3 trends we are observing. First, business PC growth was 9% this quarter. The business PC refresh cycle continues and is still in the early stages. Second, emerging markets continues to play a larger role in total PC shipment volume and now represent nearly half of all worldwide PC shipments. 
Finally, the consumer PC market declined 8% as there are several dynamics at work, including a 40% decline in netbooks, broader consumer macroeconomics, increased competition for consumer spending and the strength of Windows 7 consumer PCs in the prior year. In total, we estimate the PC market declined 1% to 3% in the third quarter. 
With that PC backdrop, I'll move on to the results for the Windows and Windows Live division. Last quarter, we noted there would be a $100 million headwind to Windows comparables for the third quarter due to the prior year Windows 7 launch. Adjusting for this dynamic, Windows revenue was in line with the PC market as we guided. As usual, you'll find an OEM revenue bridge in our earnings slide deck. 
To summarize, the PC industry dynamics of continuing strength from emerging markets offset the benefits of a higher business mix and improved attach. 
Since the launch of Windows 7, customer satisfaction and market reception have been terrific, and we have more opportunities ahead. While Windows 7 has now sold over 350 million units since launch, an estimated 75% of the PC installed base is still running older operating systems. The number of PCs running Windows 7 in the enterprise has more than doubled over the past 6 months, and volume licensing has strengthened. As I mentioned earlier, we expect the business PC refresh cycle to continue. 
Looking ahead, we are excited about the partner innovation underway in the PC market with Windows 7. There is innovation occurring in new ultra-portables, all-in-ones and other form factors, including slates and convertibles, which are starting to hit the market now. 
This quarter, we also released Windows Intune, a cloud-based subscription service that will help businesses manage and secure Windows PCs. Windows Intune provides significant new opportunities for Microsoft and our partners to further expand our reach, grow our revenue and delight customers. With Windows Intune, we have an opportunity to bring even more customers to the cloud. 
During the quarter, we launched the latest version of Internet Explorer. Internet Explorer 9 utilizes the power and performance of the whole PC to provide users with a faster, more immersive web experience. With new features, such as hardware-accelerated graphics, support for HTML 5 and integrated Windows 7 navigation, websites act more like applications on IE9. And just a few weeks after releasing IE9, we released the platform preview of IE 10, which will deliver innovation for the next generation of web experiences powered by Windows. 
Now I'll move to the Microsoft Business division, which excluding the prior year Office Tech Guarantee deferral, grew 13%. We continue to see terrific response to the release from both consumers and businesses. Adjusted for the prior year deferral, consumer revenue grew 26%, with increased Office attach to PCs. The business transactional portion grew 28%, also driven by improved attach rates, postlaunch and higher business PC shipments. The multiyear licensing portion of the business grew 5%. 
Businesses are deploying Office 2010, along with Windows 7 on the corporate desktop. Office 2010 deployment rate is 5x faster than the deployment of Office 2007. Importantly, businesses are also attaching the Office Server applications: SharePoint, Exchange and Lync, which all grew double digits this quarter. 
Lync grew 30%, and we are seeing tremendous reception to the product. As we have discussed previously, Unified Communications is a huge growth opportunity, and Lync offers an immediate return on investment to CIOs.
Last Monday, we released the public beta of Office 365, and we continue to see momentum in business Online Services. The number of customers using our services has quadrupled since last year. Over 50% of our customers are small businesses, but we're also seeing large enterprises, governmental and educational institutions moving to the cloud. This quarter, we announced large customer wins, including Shell Oil, Tampa General Hospital, Advocate Healthcare and Manpower, among others. 
Our Dynamics business grew 10%, with both Dynamics ERP and Dynamics CRM increasing account penetration. In the third quarter, we launched Dynamics CRM 2011, and we are seeing great traction with 40,000 businesses already in product trial, a significant pipeline to our current 27,000 customer base. 
We also recently announced that the next release of Dynamics ERP will be cloud enabled. We are delivering world-class business applications on premise and in the cloud that are simple, agile and deliver more values than competitive offering. 
Now let's turn to Server and Tools, which posted 11% revenue growth. Server and Tools had strong performance across the entire product portfolio. Transactional revenue grew faster than the underlying server hardware market, which we estimate grew mid-single digits. 
Multiyear license revenue grew 11%, and Enterprise Services revenue grew 12%. In the data center, we continue to increase the penetration and monetization of Windows Server and System Center. We saw strong Enterprise Agreement renewals of Windows Server this quarter and premium revenue was up double digits. 
System Center, our management offering, grew double digits for the 10th consecutive quarter. Hyper-V continues to win new business and establish new performance benchmarks on key workloads. This quarter, we showcased a large customer win, with Target Corporation. Target is running business-critical workloads for all 1,700 retail stores using Microsoft virtualization and management technologies. 
In the database, SQL Server unit volumes and ASPs were up, with a shift toward our premium editions. SQL's premium revenue has now grown double digits for 4 consecutive quarters as customers adopt higher level capabilities, such as business intelligence.
Our cloud computing platform, Windows Azure, continues to have strong momentum and developer interest. This quarter, we announced a strategic partnership with Toyota, who will be using Windows Azure for its enterprise-grade, scalable platform to provide advanced telematics services. 
Next, I'll move to the Online Services division, which grew 14%. Online advertising revenue, including both search and display, grew 17%. 
Bing's U.S. market share continue to grow, ending the quarter at 13.9%, up 190 basis points from the second quarter and almost 600 basis points since launch. We feel great about the pace of our innovation and customer satisfaction with our differentiated approach to search. However, the expected monetization of the combined Yahoo! and Bing search marketplace in the U.S. and Canada is taking longer than planned, and revenue per share remains below our expectations. We have delayed our international integration efforts to focus on improvements in the U.S. and Canada.
Now let me move to the Entertainment and Devices division, where revenue grew an impressive 60%. Xbox has been setting the pace in the gaming industry this fiscal year. With Kinect recognized as the fastest selling consumer electronics product ever, we sold an additional 2.4 million sensors this postholiday quarter. We also shipped 2.7 million Xbox 360 consoles, a new third quarter record that surpasses the previous high by 1 million units.
Xbox Live also continues to increase its contribution to our customer experience and E&D's financial performance. We again saw healthy increases in transactional revenue, which continues to exceed subscription revenue.
Turning to Windows Phone. Product reviews are good. Customer satisfaction is high, well above 90%. And we have shown a clear strategy for enabling a vibrant ecosystem around Windows Phone. This quarter, we took the next step and entered into a broad strategic alliance with Nokia. While we have enjoyed strong developer support to date with more than 13,000 applications, we've noted even greater developer interest subsequent to the Nokia alliance announcement.
Now let me cover the remainder of the income statement. Cost of goods sold increased 41% this quarter due to 3 primary factors: one, volume driven costs are up due to the success of Xbox 360 consoles and Kinect sensors. Third-party content royalties are also up, reflecting strong sales on Xbox Live. Two, as I mentioned in the Server and Tools performance, our Enterprise Services business is growing rapidly. Costs in this business are largely volume driven. And three, Online Services costs are up from increased traffic acquisition costs and increased costs related to the Yahoo! alliance. Operating expenses were $6.8 billion, an increase of 4%. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was below our guidance, due primarily to the $461 million onetime benefit related to an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service to settle a portion of their audit of tax years 2004 to 2006. 
In the third quarter, we repurchased $827 million of stock and declared $1.3 billion of dividends. Year-to-date, we've returned $13.9 billion of cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends, 33% more than the previous year.
In summary, it was a very solid quarter with strong financial results.  And with that, I'll hand it back to Peter, who's going to discuss our business outlook.
Peter Klein
Thanks, Bill. For the remainder of the call, I'll discuss our expectations for the fourth quarter and some high level themes as we begin to think about fiscal 2012. 
From a macro perspective, we expect the next quarter will be similar to the third quarter. Within the PC market, we expect growth in emerging markets to outpace developed markets and growth in business PCs to outpace consumer PCs. As a result, we expect Windows division revenue to grow roughly in line with the PC market for the fourth quarter. 
Turning to the Microsoft Business division. Transactional revenue, approximately 40% of the division's total, will continue to exceed PC shipment growth rate, but at a moderating rate as we approach the Office 2010 launch anniversary. Revenue associated with multiyear licensing agreements, representing approximately 60% of the division's total, should grow mid to high-single digits. 
Turning to Server and Tools. Approximately 30% of the division's revenue comes from transactional licensing, 50% from multiyear licensing and 20% from Enterprise Services. Within this division, we expect transactional revenue to generally track at the hardware market, and multiyear licensing revenue and Enterprise Services revenue to both grow low double digits. Within OSD, we expect online advertising revenue to perform roughly in line with the overall online advertising market. 
Moving on to the Entertainment and Devices division. Considering the enthusiastic response to the Xbox 360 platform, we now expect this division's revenue to grow roughly 25% for the fourth quarter. 
Switching to cost of goods sold, as was the case this quarter, the biggest factor impacting COGS going forward will be the growth of Entertainment and Devices, Enterprise Services and integration and traffic acquisition costs associated with our search business. 
Turning to operating expenses, we are reconfirming our guidance of $26.9 billion to $27.3 billion for fiscal year 2011. We expect our effective tax rate to be 22% to 23% for the fourth quarter, and we continue to expect capital expenditures for the full fiscal year to be about $2.5 billion. Unearned revenue will follow historical sequential growth pattern. 
Now I'd like to spend a few minutes looking ahead to our next fiscal year. From a macro perspective, we expect the business PC refresh cycle to continue through fiscal 2012. The PC market dynamics I discussed for Q4, emerging markets outpacing developed markets and business outpacing consumer should also continue through the next fiscal year. While we expect ongoing healthy demand for Office 2010, we expect more difficult year-over-year comparables for the Microsoft Business division. 
For Server and Tools, we expect to continue to outpace the server market due to our premium offerings and product portfolio. Within our search business, we expect to see revenue per search improvements over the course of the calendar year. 
Lastly, we expect momentum within our Entertainment and Devices division to continue. 
Moving on to Cost of Goods Sold, as was the case in fiscal 2011, the most important factor to consider will be the shift of revenue mix across hardware, software, Enterprise Services and Online Services. We expect fiscal year 2012 operating expenses to grow 3% to 5% from the midpoint of our fiscal 2011 guidance, as we continue to prioritize our spending and manage our expenses. Based on this growth rate, we expect fiscal 2012 operating expenses to be $28.0 billion to $28.6 billion. We expect capital expenditures to be about $2.5 billion for fiscal year 2012. 
In summary, I'm pleased with our healthy financial results for the quarter. As we look forward into the next fiscal year, our robust product portfolio and ongoing focus on cost management will enable us to continue to deliver shareholder value. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill, and we'll take some questions.
Bill Koefoed
Thanks, Peter. We want to get questions from as many of you as possible, so please stick to just one question and avoid long or multipart questions. Bobbi, please go ahead and repeat your instructions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adam Holt from Morgan Stanley.
Adam Holt - Morgan Stanley
My question is on expenses. In the quarter, the gross margin was a little bit lower than I had modeled. I was wondering if you could go through the puts and takes of what hit gross margin this quarter? And then looking into fiscal '12 in general, would you expect revenue to outpace your operating expense growth?
Peter Klein
Thanks, Adam. On gross margin, it was really the 3 things that Bill described. Sort of the biggest thing is fantastic growth in the Xbox business, and that was the single biggest driver of COGS growth in the quarter. Secondly, Enterprise Services, which is volume-driven, and they are having nice growth, so that shows up in COGS. And then finally in Online Services, some costs associated with the Yahoo! alliance. As you know, some of that revenue that we get from that alliance from the Yahoo! property gets tacked out in COGS and some other traffic acquisition costs. Those were the 3 big drivers of the COGS growth, all volume driven.
Bill Koefoed
With respect to the second part of your question, Adam, as you know, we don't give revenue -- specific revenue guidance. And we give you operating expense guidance and you can model it from there.
Operator
Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard from Citigroup.
Walter Pritchard - Citigroup Inc
Could you help us understand just on the COGS, I guess, following on to Adam's question here? As we look into next year with some of the integration costs around Yahoo!, and I guess I'm also wondering around kind of mix within EDD, how much we should expect, sort of what we've seen over the course of this year be indicative of where gross margins are in the future? Do we think we're on sort of a new kind of trajectory in those individual businesses?
Peter Klein
Well it depends what you model in for the volume, right? So these COGS are volume driven, so depending on how you think about each of those individual businesses, really is the driver of COGS. We try to give that framework, so it's easier to understand that. And certainly on the Online Services business, our key focus is that COGS are volume driven. Most important thing there is to get that revenue per search up because that really has the biggest impact on the gross margin.
Operator
Our next question comes from Heather Bellini from the ISI Group.
Heather Bellini - ISI Group Inc.
Peter, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about buybacks. I know that Bill said the return of capital to shareholders was up 1/3 versus last year. But I'm just wondering if you could talk about the level of buybacks and kind of, how we should think about your appetite for buybacks going forward?
Peter Klein
Yes -- no, I think we have a pretty consistent track record over the last several years in terms of distributing cash back to shareholders, in terms of dividend and buyback. And so those numbers that Bill cited were sort of indicative of that. We've had a pretty consistent track record on that, and that's been our philosophy.
Operator
The next question comes from Brent Thill from UBS.
Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank
Peter, can you just reconcile, on the PC market, Intel and AMD are saying one thing, you're saying it's worse. And just trying to understand, is this because of piracy or lower ASPs? What's accounting for that? And what's your view in terms of the snapback for the PC market in the second half of the year?
Peter Klein
There are some unique things going on with Intel's results that you can sort of reconcile back to what we're saying that make a lot of sense. First, if you try to reconcile their revenue growth, certainly, they have an ASP uplift, which is actually the single biggest part of driving the growth. There's a few other things in terms of an extra week in the quarter. They've also excluded netbooks from the PC MPU numbers.  And I think there was some appropriate inventory buildup so if you look at our numbers, it ties pretty closely from a unit perspective to what they're seeing. And obviously, we're in line with the big third party analysts as well.
Operator
Mr. Phil Winslow from Credit Suisse, your line is open.
Philip Winslow - Crédit Suisse AG
Just looking for a little bit more color on the Microsoft Business Division side. Obviously, we're coming on the sort of the tail end directly of uplift of Office 2010. Obviously, you're talking about tougher comps, but what is sort of the right long-term growth rate for that business over the next couple of years? And then also, just in terms of G&A, we saw a big step up quarter-to-quarter this quarter. Was there anything onetime in there like you guys had in the December and March quarters of fiscal '10?
Peter Klein
So obviously, we're not guiding to specific growth rates for MBD, but I would highlight a few things. Obviously, we're incredibly excited about the customer reaction to Office 2010. But even beyond that, you heard us talk about how customers are adopting the whole sort of suite of products, not just the Office application, but SharePoint, Exchange, Dynamics and Lync. And that really provides long-term sustainable growth for the MBD business all up, even in a year that's sort of not a launch year. So that's, I think, a way to think about what's going on in MBD. In addition to that, we've got Office 365, so -- over the course of the next coming years. We've had great growth. As we talked about, quadrupled the number of sort of Business Online Services customers we have. With the introduction of Office 365, we sort of take that to the next level. So as you think about the next year or 2 for the MBD business, those are some of the factors that I think really drive their growth.
Operator
Colin Gillis from BGC Financial, your line is open.
Colin Gillis - BGC Partners, Inc.
Can you just talk to the new leadership in Servers, like what Satya brings to the group?
Peter Klein
Yes, Satya is just a wonderful business leader. He comes from a background of both business applications and cloud services, so he's really the ideal guy to take that business to the next level. I personally had the -- an opportunity to work with Satya closely in the past. [Technical Difficulty] He's a great leader.
Operator
Our next question comes from Brad Reback from Oppenheimer.
Brad Reback - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.
So Peter, there's been a lot of confusion or a lot of talk around the Nokia partnership, what the economics are. Could you maybe help straighten out the record on that? And probably more importantly, give us any sense that there's going to be an impact to 2012 COGS as it relates to this deal?
Peter Klein
Well I will talk about the Nokia. The great thing about the Nokia deal is this in an incredibly perfect opportunity for both of us to build a really compelling, vibrant third ecosystem, if you think about the complementary set of assets that we all bring to it. And in terms of the hardware design, the hardware manufacturing, the global relationships with operators, certainly with our platform that has great developer momentum and the kinds of services of Xbox Live and Office. Clearly, this is a broad strategic alliance, it's a long-term strategic alliance, and we're going to be working closely together. And we are each making investments together along those lines. And I think the important thing to think about is, as we sort of build that out in its success, it's going to be a great thing for both companies and for customers and for other partners in the ecosystem.
Operator
Robert Breza from RBC Capital Market.
Robert Breza - RBC Capital Markets, LLC
Just quickly, can you talk about the delay that you're doing internationally? And how long do you think that'll take before you can get it up and running?
Peter Klein
Yes, we're going to work on North America, the U.S. and Canada. And when we feel like we've got that straightened out, we'll move on to the other international markets.
Operator
Our next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz from Cowen.
Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC
Peter, you're tracking to lose a few more cents in the online division in fiscal '11 versus fiscal '10. Obviously, RPS improvements going forward would help, but you'll also be rolling out the integrated platform to additional markets. So wondering if you could perhaps offer anything else about the EPS prospects for OSD next year relative to fiscal '11?
Peter Klein
Yes, well certainly, we're not going to give specific outlook more than what we've given, but you've hit on the key issue, which is the revenue per search. That's -- we've been clear on the opportunity. And the strategy there is to continue to grow share and to increase our revenue per search. And so obviously, we're laser focused right now on getting that revenue per search up, and that has high leverage into certain margins for the company going forward.
Operator
Sandeep Aggarwal from Caris & Company.
Sandeep Aggarwal - Caris & Company
Peter, can you provide us any color in terms of the -- how's the, your new architecture effort for -- on tablet size progressing in terms of system-on-a-chip?
Peter Klein
No, I've got nothing else to talk about that other than what we've already said.
Operator
Ed Maguire from CLSA.
Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.
You discussed healthy activity in multiyear commitments. Could you address how you and your customers are mixing Business Online Services? And looking at Office 365, how ultimately that may affect your model in terms of COGS?
Peter Klein
Yes -- no, it's a great question. Actually, one of the interesting things about Business Online Services and the coming -- the pending Office 365 is, it's enabling really great conversations. And actually, it's been a driver of the increase in multiyear licensing commitments because people have a lot of questions about the cloud and the transition to the cloud, having a clear story, having a partner that can help them transition in the pace that they want to. It's actually been the driver of the conversations we're having with enterprises. And going forward, the economics of that are it's an increased revenue and total profit opportunity for us. The subscription services do have a higher COGS and so a lower gross margin in terms of percentage, but over time, that's a growth in absolute margin dollars for us.
Operator
Our next question comes from Kash Rangan from Merrill Lynch.
Kash Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch
When I look at this quarter, we've already gotten past the 4 quarters, how product cycle helped revenue growth. It looks like this quarter, if I make adjustments for Office, you're still looking at high-single digit 8%, 10% type growth rate against normal comparisons. Any reasons to think that if IT spending and economy continue to stay the way they are, to think that this growth rate should, in fact, decelerate as you go into fiscal '12? Or if you can argue the other side that it should stay, that this growth rate is sustainable? Both sides of the argument, appreciate it, thanks.
Peter Klein
Yes, without giving specific guidance on growth rates, I will say we feel great about how enterprises are investing in IT, and in particular, how they are very interested in our product suite. I think we've got a very broad compelling set of products for the enterprise. And if you look at any number of CIO surveys, most of them say, a high priority focus area for CIOs is our suite of products. And so directionally, I would say we feel great about sort of the IT market and certainly, our position in that and our product set.
Operator
Our final question comes from Tim Klasell from Stifel, Nicolaus.
Tim Klasell - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Maybe you can just give us your thoughts about the timing of a launch of the next-generation Xbox console? And if a decision hasn't been made, do you guys internally have a time point of when you think you have to make that decision?
Peter Klein
No, we're really not talking about that. Right now, we're incredibly excited to about what's going on with the Xbox 360 console and certainly Kinect, which is relatively new in the market, so we're very focused on that. Okay, so that will wrap up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. A few weeks ago, we announced our plans for Microsoft's 2011 Financial Analyst Meeting, which will be on the afternoon of September 14, 2011, in Anaheim, California. FAM will be held in conjunction with our Developer Conference, which will kick off on September 13 at the Anaheim Convention Center. This year's FAM will feature presentations by key executives about the company's strategic direction and will supplement the Developer Conference Presentations, which offer people the opportunity to learn directly about our product strategies and roadmap. In the meantime, we look forward to seeing many of you at the numerous conferences in which we are participating in this quarter. For those of you unable to attend any of our events in person, you will always be able to follow our comments at microsoft.com/investor. Please contact us if you need any additional details. Thank you again, and have a great day.

Welcome to the Microsoft Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would like to turn the call over to your host, Bill Koefoed, General Manager, Investor Relations. You may begin.
Bill Koefoed
Thank you, Holly, and thank you, everyone for joining us this afternoon. As usual, with me today are Peter Klein, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel. Today, we filed our Form 10-Q. In addition, we posted our earnings release and financial summary slide deck to our Investor Relations website at microsoft.com/investor. The slide deck is intended to follow the flow of our prepared remarks and provides a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. As a reminder, we will post today's prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available.
Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and use the transcript at the Microsoft Investor Relations website until January 27, 2012.

Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
Okay, and with that, I'll turn the call over to Peter.
Peter Klein
Thanks, Bill. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm extremely pleased with our performance this quarter. We delivered excellent top line and bottom line results. Business and consumer response to our latest wave of innovation, including Office 2010 and Kinect, helped drive yet another quarter of healthy revenue growth, resulting in revenue of nearly $20 billion. 
Our solid revenue performance, combined with cost controls and continued prioritization of investments into the highest growth opportunities, enabled us to deliver record earnings per share and our sixth consecutive quarter of operating margin expansion.
On our last earnings call, I commented that we were looking forward to an exciting holiday quarter, especially from consumers. Kinect, in particular, exceeded our expectation. The controller-free entertainment experience is revolutionizing the living room. Kinect is the fastest-selling consumer electronics device in history. We couldn't be more proud of what the team has accomplished. But importantly, it's just our first step in delivering on the opportunity to fundamentally change the way people interact with technology.
The Microsoft Business Division also had a terrific quarter. Office 2010 is the most successful consumer version we have ever shipped, and the product is also performing extremely well in the Business segment. Companies are purchasing Office 2010 as well as our entire productivity platform, including SharePoint, Exchange and Lync. Businesses are also deploying Windows 7. According to IDC, nearly 90% of enterprise companies worldwide have already started their formal migrations to Windows 7.
In addition to healthy enterprise deployment of our Business Desktop, we saw a strong momentum for our business infrastructure offerings. Windows Server and SQL Server premium revenues grew double digits, and this quarter marks the one year anniversary of Windows Server 2008 R2. Since its launch, we have grown our share of the overall server market every quarter.
During the quarter, we continued our product launch momentum. In November, we delivered Microsoft Lync 2010, a next-generation communications platform that incorporates instant messaging, presence, audio, video, Web conferencing and voice into one interface that integrates with the applications businesses are already using today, including Microsoft Office, SharePoint and Exchange.
For the consumer, I already mentioned Kinect. Also during the quarter, we launched Windows Phone 7, which is now on nine devices with 60 operators in 30 markets. We said all along that our first priority was to make a phone people love, and to that end, we're pleased with the initial response. Customer satisfaction data indicates 93% of customers worldwide are happy with the product, and we're also seeing strong developer engagement. While we're encouraged by the early progress, we realize we still have a lot of work ahead of us, and we remain focused and committed to the long-term success of Windows Phone 7.
We continue to deliver sustained innovation and releases for Bing. In addition to transitioning Yahoo!'s paid search in the U.S. and Canada during the quarter, we also entered into a strategic partnership with Facebook. Bing now provides much more personalized experiences by allowing users to bring their Facebook friends into their Search experiences.
So in summary, our record performance for this quarter rounded out a very successful calendar year for Microsoft. We delivered strong financial results and invigorated the market with our product innovation.
With that, I'll hand it back to Bill to provide more details on the quarter's results.
Bill Koefoed
Thanks, Peter. I'll start today by noting that all of my comments are adjusted for the $1.7 billion of deferred revenue, which was recognized in the second quarter of last year. The deferral was related to the Windows 7 Upgrade Program and Windows 7 licenses sold in advance of general availability. We've reconciled the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP results in our earnings slide deck. All growth comparisons I make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless I specify otherwise.
Okay, now to our results. This quarter's performance continued the momentum we've seen over the past year. Total revenue for the company was up 15% to nearly $20 billion. Operating income grew 20% and earnings per share grew 28%. Bookings grew 21%, which marks the fourth consecutive quarter of strong double-digit bookings growth.
We continue to see strong momentum with Windows 7. As Peter mentioned, nearly 90% of enterprise companies worldwide have started their formal migrations to Windows 7 and many have already recognized material savings as a result.
Office 2010 is the fastest-selling consumer version of Office in history, with license sales over 50% ahead of Office 2007 for the equivalent period following launch. Office clearly remains the world's most popular productivity platform for both home and work.
We've experienced an incredible consumer response to our latest products. Kinect, in particular, was the hottest gift this holiday season and has been mentioned by a number of publications as the most innovative product of 2010.
Businesses of all sizes continued to commit to Microsoft's platforms. This quarter, we saw a better-than-expected increase in transactional licensing and Enterprise Agreements renewed in the historical range.
Our unearned revenue balance grew 7% year-over-year to $13.4 billion. On a sequential basis, after adjusting for the $224 million of Office Tech Guarantee recognition, our unearned revenue balance declined $278 million. Our contracted-not-billed balance grew to over $16.5 billion, a $700 million increase from the prior quarter. This growth in our customer's multiyear commitment, combined with our strong transactional sales, resulted in a solid 21% growth in year-over-year bookings. Geographically, emerging markets continued to outperform mature markets.
Now turning to the PC market, we estimate close to 90 million PCs were sold globally, the biggest quarter ever, representing growth of 2% to 4%. Business PCs grew faster than consumer PCs as companies continued to refresh hardware and has opt to Windows 7. Within consumer PCs, netbooks declined from their peak last year while notebook growth remained healthy.
With that PC backdrop, I'll move on to the results for the Windows and Windows Live division. Last quarter, we noted that there would be a $600 million headwind to Windows comparables for the second quarter due to the Windows 7 launch spike last year. Adjusting for this dynamic and the prior-year Tech Guarantee recognition, Windows and Windows Live revenue growth was in line with the PC market.
As usual, you'll find an OEM revenue bridge in our earnings slide deck. The revenue per license benefit from a higher business mix was offset by emerging markets growing faster than developed market.
This quarter marks the one-year anniversary of Windows 7. Today, we are announcing that we have sold over 300 million Windows 7 licenses to date, continuing its momentum as the fastest-selling operating system in history.
Looking ahead, we are excited about the partner innovation underway in the PC and Windows 7 ecosystem as seen at CES. The PC hardware dynamics are incredibly strong, with innovation in new ultra-portables, all-in-ones and other form factors, including tablets, plates and convertibles. The new Intel Sandy Bridge and AMD Fusion chip architectures substantially improved performance, graphics and battery life.
In addition, we announced at CES that the next version of Windows will support System on a Chip architectures, including ARM-based systems form partners NVIDIA, Qualcomm and Texas Instruments and x86-based systems from partners Intel and AMD. Windows on System on a Chip architectures will fuel significant innovation across a spectrum of devices. We are enthusiastic about the future of device innovation and the role Windows is playing.
Now let's move to Server & Tools, which posted 10% revenue growth. Non-annuity revenue grew roughly in line with the underlying server hardware market, which we estimate grew high-single-digits. Multi-year license revenue growth was roughly 11% and Enterprise Services revenue grew 9%. In the data center, we continue to be pleased with our progress in virtualization and systems management. The virtualization trend is driving double-digit System Center and Windows Server premium revenue growth while significantly lowering our customers' costs. In the database, premium offerings are also a core focus of our strategy, and this quarter, we saw a double-digit growth in SQL Server premium revenue.
Among other customer wins this quarter, Dollar Thrifty Auto Group migrated their mission-critical pricing system from Oracle to a Microsoft data management solution, a strategic move that supports the company's goal to standardize on high-value cost-effective technologies. We are excited about SQL Server and our opportunity to drive Tier 1 customer wins.
In the cloud, we continued to see developer interest and application development on the Windows Azure platform. Earlier in the quarter at PDC, we unveiled a number of additional platform enhancement and showed how leading companies like Pixar Animation Studios and ADP with NVoicePay were able to develop innovative solutions with Azure.
Next, I'll move to the Online Services division which grew 19%. Online advertising revenue, including both Search and Display, grew 23% and now includes revenue-driven by our Search partnership with Yahoo!, which is implemented in the U.S. and Canada during the quarter. We continue to make progress on the partnership, and earlier this month, we transitioned to algorithmic search traffic in Mexico, Brazil and Australia.
Bing's U.S. market share continued to grow, ending the quarter at 12% and our Search revenue growth rate again outperformed the market leader.
During the quarter, we announced the significant expansion of our partnership with Facebook, where Bing will provide more personalized experiences by allowing users to Search Facebook profiles and incorporate their friend's like into search results. We believe the addition of these new social features is another way to deliver innovation and valuable enhancements to the Bing experience.
Next, I'll move to the Microsoft Business Division, which continues to show solid launch momentum with revenue growing 24%. This includes $224 million of recognized revenue pertaining to the Office Tech Guarantee. We've seen enthusiastic consumer response to Office 2010 and business demand has also been strong with the transactional components of MBD sales up over 40%. The multi-year licensing portion of the business grew 9%. CIOs are investing in the new productivity scenarios enabled by SharePoint, Exchange, Lync and Dynamics CRM, which are enhanced when deployed with Office 2010.
Lync grew over 20% this quarter while SharePoint 2010 and Dynamics CRM both continue to grow double digits. This quarter, we reported a number of cloud productivity wins, including the State University of New York, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, DuPont and the state of California among others. We have seen an immediate customer and partner response to the Office 365 announcement, with the beta oversubscribed within its first day.
Just two weeks ago, we launched Dynamics CRM online in 40 markets. We're already seeing customers switching from Salesforce.com to Dynamics CRM online. It saves money, it's more flexible and it's easy to use with the familiar Microsoft Office experience for increased productivity.
Let's move on to the Entertainment and Devices division, where revenue grew 55% and operating income has now surpassed $1 billion year-to-date, which is a major milestone for this division. Kinect exceeded all expectations with 8 million stand-alone and bundled sensors sold in just 60 days. And since we updated the consoles last June, Xbox 360 has had tremendous momentum. We sold a record 6.3 million consoles this quarter, a unit increase of 21%. This helped drive Xbox Live membership up 30% to 30 million active members.
In addition, at CES, we announced a number of upcoming feature enhancements, including Kinect support for Netflix, Hulu Plus and Avatar Kinect, which will advance how people communicate and enjoy their television experiences.
Windows Phone 7 is off to a solid start as handset manufacturers purchased over 2 million licenses in the quarter. Windows Phone 7 is making progress in its early days as user satisfaction is extremely high, and developer momentum has continued to build to now over 24,000 registered developers. As we announced at CES, we are looking forward to adding more features including support for CDMA.
Now let me cover the remainder of the income statement. Cost of goods sold increased 33% to $4.8 billion, driven primarily by increased Xbox hardware volume and online costs. Operating expenses were $7 billion in the quarter, an increase of 1%. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22%, below our guidance of 23% to 24%, due primarily to the one-time benefit of the retroactive extension of the R&D tax credit from January 1, 2010. In the second quarter, we repurchased $5 billion of shares and declared $1.3 billion of dividends, continuing to deliver on our commitment to return cash to shareholders.
In summary, it was a strong quarter both for our product momentum, as well as for our financial results.
And with that, I'll hand it back to Peter, who's going to discuss our business outlook for the remainder of this fiscal year.
Peter Klein
Thanks, Bill. For the remainder of the call, I'll discuss our expectations for the third quarter and the remainder of fiscal 2011. According to various surveys, enterprise IT spend is forecast to grow in 2011, and Windows 7 and Office 2010 remained among the highest priorities for CIOs. We remain confident in our ability to continue to grow our share of the IT spending market.
We expect the business PC refresh cycle to continue. In terms of PC growth, we expect business to outpace consumer and emerging markets to outpace developed markets. With that backdrop, let me turn to segment expectations.
Windows division revenue should grow roughly in line with the PC market for the third quarter and the full year when excluding the revenue attributable to the prior-year launch spike and Tech Guarantee. As we said previously, when looking at year-over-year growth, you should exclude $100 million from Q3 of fiscal 2010 for the launch spike. And for full fiscal year 2010, you should exclude $700 million of revenue for the launch and $300 million for the Tech Guarantee.
Moving on to Server & Tools. From Q3 and the full year, we expect non-annuity revenue, approximately 30% of the total, to generally track with the hardware market. Multi-year licensing revenue, which is about 50% of the total and enterprise services the remaining 20%, should grow high-single-digits for the third quarter and low double-digits for the full fiscal year.
Turning to expectations for the Microsoft Business Division, consumer and business non-annuity revenue, approximately 40% of the division's total revenue, will continue to exceed PC shipment growth rates for the third quarter and the fiscal year due to the Office 2010 launch. We expect revenue associated with multi-year agreements representing approximately 60% of total revenue, to grow mid- to high-single-digits for the third quarter and the fiscal year. When updating your models, remember that in Q3 of fiscal 2010, we deferred approximately $300 million related to the Office Tech Guarantee.
Moving on to our Online Services division. While we feel great about the progress we have made with the partnership, we recognize that there has been some market place disruption. We are working diligently to address any issues, and we expect the benefits of the integration to occur gradually over the next several quarters. We expect online advertising revenue, including organic revenue and new revenue associated with our Yahoo! partnership, to outperform the overall online advertising market in Q3 and for the full fiscal year. When updating your models, keep in mind that roughly 75% of Yahoo!-related revenue will be recognized net of traffic acquisition costs.
Moving on to the Entertainment and Devices division. Considering the enthusiastic response to the Xbox 360 platform, including the Kinect Sensor, we now expect this division's revenue to grow roughly 50% for the third quarter and roughly 40% for the full fiscal year.
Switching to cost of goods sold. As was the case this quarter, the biggest factor impacting COGS going forward will be the growth of the Entertainment and Devices division. Xbox consoles and Kinect Sensors have higher COGS than the rest of our products, and due to our growth expectations for these products, we remind you to consider this impact in your models.
Turning to operating expenses. We are reconfirming our guidance of $26.9 billion to $27.3 billion for the full fiscal year. We continue to expect capital expenditures for fiscal year 2011 to be about $2.5 billion and our effective tax rate to be 23% to 24% for the third quarter and the remainder of the fiscal year. Finally, at the end of the third quarter, we expect unearned revenue to roughly follow historic seasonal patterns.
In summary, we're extremely pleased with the strong financial performance and continued product innovation we delivered this quarter. Heading into calendar year 2011, our product portfolio has never been stronger, and this combined with our continued prioritization of investments into the highest growth opportunities,  will help us drive long-term revenue and earnings per share growth.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill and we'll take some questions.
Bill Koefoed
Great. We want to get the questions from as many of you as possible so please stick to just one question and avoid long or multi-part questions. Holly, can you please go ahead and repeat your instructions?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley.
Adam Holt - Morgan Stanley
My question is about the corporate upgrade cycle and the impacts on where you are on Windows 7. Would you expect to see the business premium mix increase from the 30% level as you get a little bit deeper into the cycle? And can you update us on where you think you are in terms of any improvements around software insurance attach?
Peter Klein
Yes. In general, as we talked about the seeing the business refresh and the sort of intent to deploy the enterprises, obviously to the extent their strength in the business PC market, that will be helpful for the mix that you indicated. So given our outlook that, that will continue to outpace consumer markets, that's a good thing. To your point on SA, you think about the commercial side of the business and the volume licensing part the business, that has been strong, reflecting all those numbers that we talked about. So that has sort of -- as we've talked about that a relatively smaller portion of the OEM portion but it's having a favorable impact on the overall growth of the division.

Walter Pritchard with Citi.
Walter Pritchard - Citigroup Inc
Bill and Peter, I'm wondering if you can talk about, in MBD we saw really strong transactional business that make up 40% or so, and I think you sort of pulled it to expect that to grow more in line with PCs. And I'm just wondering if you saw any of the business that maybe would have been annuity in nature that showed up in the quarter and transactional, explain part of that strength?
Peter Klein
No, not really. We're seeing strength both in the annuity side and in transactional side, so it's really incremental which led to their high growth. It's probably helpful to frame that so you can understand the complete picture. We talked a little bit about the strong growth in contracted not billed, because really the funnel where that multi-year licensing revenue really comes into Microsoft. And ultimately, that will flow through to the balance sheet and the income statement so we saw a strong contracted not billed, a lot of that was Office, and obviously, Server & Tools. And so what we're seeing is strong contracted not billed, strong transactional reflected the bookings growth that Bill talked about. So really what we're seeing is better-than-expected uptake, particularly in small and mid-sized companies, who typically buy transactional licenses, not enterprises who typically buy the multi-year agreements. So it really is increased strength in the Office business.
Operator
Heather Bellini with ISI Group.
Heather Bellini - ISI Group Inc.
I just have a follow-up to Walter's question about the strength in MBD. I mean, you made the comment that non-annuity revenue will exceed PC growth, and obviously, you did a phenomenal job at that this quarter. But this is a much wider gap than what we've seen in the past. So I guess what I'm trying to ask is, do you expect the gap that you've normally been outpacing PC shipments to kind of the gap to widen similar to what we saw this quarter versus what historicals might tell us?
Peter Klein
Well, the only thing I could say, Heather, as the outlook that we gave is the outlook that we gave. We continue to be certainly very pleased with the customer response to Office 2010. We thought we had a great product coming into the cycle, and that has proven to be true from the customer response. Not only to the suite of applications themselves but how they integrate with SharePoint and Exchange and Lync. So I would just lead you to the outlook that we gave, and we remain incredibly pleased with the customer reaction to the product.
Operator
Brent Thill with UBS.
Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank
Peter, just on the multi-year licensing pick-up that you're seeing, can you just give us a typical term length in terms of what those contracts are renewing at? And the contracts that are coming back, are they now renewing above the original contract values? Is that a trend that you're seeing as things are improving?
Peter Klein
They are typically three-year contracts. They sort of vary in length but that's the most common length of our multi-year agreements. In many cases, we are adding new products and services to our multi-year agreements. We talked about some of the products that are showing growth that are some of the newer enterprise products like Lync, like SQL Server Premium Editions. We're starting to get those migrations from Oracle, Tier 1 applications over to SQL. And so as we continue to do those things and people invest in our platform, I think you'll see some opportunity there.
Operator
Phil Winslow with Crédit Suisse.
Philip Winslow - Crédit Suisse AG
Just a question on the Windows division. Obviously, PC shipments globally solid, pretty significantly this quarter. Just looking at your KPIs, Windows license shipments were actually down 5% year-over-year. Just wondering if you could give us a sense of how much you think since obviously, the PC data is in selling as this relates to sort of launch of Oak Trail, Sandy Bridge and so forth in Q1 affecting, you call it, inventory levels but in sort of the channel but also Windows license inventories inside OEMs and how that should maybe change when you think about the calendar Q1?
Bill Koefoed
Yes. In looking at the OEM license growth, keep in mind that there was a spike from the launch last year in Q2, which makes that, exacerbates that issue as people booked up some inventory there. But in general, I wouldn't characterize what we saw in this fiscal quarter as sort of having anything to do with Q1 and some of the new chipsets. I think we saw some macro things on the consumer side but business remains very strong, and I don't think that played a big part in it.
Peter Klein
I would say we just see the opportunity for Sandy Bridge and Fusion as an opportunity for businesses to improve their refresh outlook as you start to get into 2011. They were super bullish on the chipsets from both of those manufacturers.
Operator
Katherine Egbert with Jefferies.
Katherine Egbert - Jefferies & Company, Inc.
You always say that emerging PC market is going faster than the mature market. Can you give us some color on that? And then also talk about PC pricing, especially in consumer. And then finally, any comment on tablets and cannibalization?
Peter Klein
Sure. Emerging markets are growing faster than developed markets. Probably 2x is not a bad sort of ballpark for how to speak through that. Obviously, China played a big part in that and that's the important issue to think through and certainly an opportunity for us going forward.
Katherine Egbert - Jefferies & Company, Inc.
Pricing?
Peter Klein
Pricing on?
Bill Koefoed
Emerging markets versus developed markets.
Peter Klein
Yes, we've always said that there's about half of what you'd see in developed markets.
Katherine Egbert - Jefferies & Company, Inc.
But there seems to be reports that pricing has bottomed. Have you seen that?
Bill Koefoed
We really haven't changed our prices much at all.
Katherine Egbert - Jefferies & Company, Inc.
And then finally, just tablets and cannibalization.
Peter Klein
I think that as Bill talked a little bit in his comments about netbooks and how netbooks were, they hit their peak last year in Q2, and I think what we've seen is over the course of this year in the consumer space, some of that volume being replaced with newer devices like ultra-portables and tablets. And largely, these are second devices, not primary devices. And that's caused a little bit of a drag on the consumer side.
Operator
Brad Reback with Oppenheimer.
Brad Reback - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.
Just a quick question, Peter. You had talked about the SQL Server Premium business being up double digits in the quarter. I know earlier this week, I think as you announced some appliances with HP. Do you think that type of relationship could further accelerate that growth?
Peter Klein
Yes. I mean, I think partnerships with some of our key partners are very important for helping us to continue to grow in that part of the market, and HP is a perfect example of somebody who's a very important part -- a partner when it comes to some of this infrastructure and database platforms, and even more broadly, in the cloud pertaining to the market. So yes, I think that can be a real benefit.
Operator
Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.
Kash Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch
It looks like you're talking of the business PC versus consumer PC and also, implicitly, the premium mix should also go up yet you're talking about client revenues more or less in line with the PC unit growth rate for fiscal year. I'm trying to reconcile the contradiction there because it would seem like your client revenue should grow faster than PC units, given what we're talking about, especially coupled with Windows 7 enterprise upgrade cycle. Any comments?
Peter Klein
It's the emerging markets growing faster than developed markets. So we have offsetting dynamics going on. Business PC is growing faster than consumer. It's good for attach and good for pricing and emerging markets growing faster than developed markets has the opposite effect. And so what you're seeing is largely those two things offsetting each other.
Operator
Colin Gillis with BGC Financial.
Colin Gillis - BGC Partners, Inc.
Just real briefly, Search is now basically a duopoly and a lot of the Search marketers are looking pretty favorably, if anything. Is now the time to increase the outreach marketing efforts?
Peter Klein
Well, we're extremely focused on doing what we need to do to be successful in that business. And we've been laser beam focused on what that is. One is growing our Search share and the other is growing our revenue per search. And we continue to grow our share every quarter. We're going to continue to focus on that.  We're going to do a lot of things, a lot of the same things that we're doing to that. Bill talked about some of the product enhancements. I think that's probably the most important thing we can do to really differentiate the product experience because I think that's really what drives usage and share in Search. And then of course, on the revenue per search side, the Yahoo! integration is the key component of that, and we're excited to move forward in that. But really on the share side, I mean, we'll do interesting marketing things like we have been doing. But I think what I'm really get excited about is product enhancement with some of the partnerships we've got there.
Operator
Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen.
Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC
I wonder if you could update us on where the thing stands with regards to Kinect supply and how should we be thinking about units in the Q3. And relatedly, the E&D operating margin of 18% was up three points year-over-year and a little bit of then would have expect to give the marketing launch around Kinect. If you could talk about the prospects for margin expansion over the next couple of years?
Peter Klein
Well, to your first question on supply, I think you should just go to the outlook framework that we gave you to have a good sense of what we expect for the Xbox business in E&D sort of over the next coming quarters. And in terms of margin, the long-term story is a good one, right? As we build our installed base -- the business model for that is build an install base that really engage users and then you'd attach lots of software and services to has been part of the strength of the Xbox Live service. And of course, as we build the installed base of Kinect, we have a whole new generation and evolution of games that we can sell into our installed base. So all of those things are very positive long term for that business. In the short term for this quarter, we obviously prioritize and allocate our resources very carefully against the launch of that, and so we're able to have a successful launch and still improve the profitability profile of the business.

John DiFucci with JPMorgan.
John DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co
Peter, I think you said that IDC said that 90% of enterprise companies had started to form a migration to Windows 7. Can you tell us how penetrated you think even roughly corporations are at this point? And when I say corporations, exclude small business. Really talking mid-market to enterprise.
Peter Klein
I don't know exactly. It's very early. I could give you some of anecdotal feedback in certain conversations that we have with our sales folks and directly with customers. The majority of the people I talk to are either in the middle of doing it or at the last stages of evaluating and have a specific plan to do it. And in fact, most of them have said, we want to go faster because once they get started, they realize the productivity benefits and the cost savings are really compelling. But it is early in terms of getting those migrations done.
Operator
Robert Breza with RBC Capital Markets.
Robert Breza - RBC Capital Markets, LLC
Peter, I was wondering if you could talk to us about really the cloud momentum I saw in the slide in the slide deck. But really as you look at Office 365 launching from a beta perspective and to oversubscribed, can you maybe just walk us through how you see cloud revenue 12, 24 months out?
Peter Klein
Yes, I'm really excited about roadmap and the opportunity. We obviously haven't given any guidance on the revenue of that and how fast it's going to ramp up. Certainly, excited both about the customer wins that we talked about for our existing product and then the conversations we're having about the roadmap off of Office 365 are really exciting. So in addition to just the beta being oversubscribed, it's not part of the conversations we're having with all of our customers. And it's one of those things where it's going to happen and the exact sort of speed of the ramp is uncertain. I do believe that once it starts to accelerate, it's going to accelerate pretty fast.
Operator
Ed Maguire with CSLA.
Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.
I just wanted to follow up on Rob's question around the Online Services and Azure. Could you talk about some of the conversations that you're having and the criteria? As customers are deciding whether to stay on premise or adopt the Software-as-a-Service solution, what that means in terms of their economics and ultimately, what it may mean for you and the business model as it becomes a bigger part of the business?
Peter Klein
Yes. There's really two dimensions to the conversation. One is about economics and one is about capabilities. The talk about sort of the applications, the Office 365 types of services. People are very interested in that for two reasons. One, ultimately, if the economics are very good for them once they migrate over. But probably even the stronger driver, especially now in the conversations, is the ability to more quickly take advantage of the latest capabilities that we have. So it's a very easy way to deploy the latest versions of our software and increasingly, that's really the biggest piece of the dialogue. And for that, on the Office 365 side, on the Azure side, the conversation's really about moving up from thinking about infrastructure-as-a-service to platform-as-a-service and what they get with Azure in terms of management and security and sort of the developer ecosystem. So that's really what excites them in talking about the platform of the service of Azure, if you will.

Welcome to the Microsoft's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Koefoed, General Manager, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Bill Koefoed
Thank you, Barb, and thank you, everyone for joining us this afternoon. As usual, with me here today are Peter Klein, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel.
Today we filed our Form 10-Q. In addition, we posted our earnings release and financial summary slide deck on our new Investor Relations website at microsoft.com/investor. The slide deck is intended to follow the flow of our prepared remarks and provide a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, as well as a summary of segment reporting to industry historical results. As was the case last quarter, we will post today's prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call will be webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission in the transcript and any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript at the Microsoft Investor Relations website until October 28, 2011.

Unauthorized reproduction or distribution of this call or any portion of it without the expressed written permission of Microsoft may result in civil and criminal penalty. Today, we will be making statements during this call that are forward looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
Okay. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Peter.
Peter Klein
Thanks, Bill. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to be able to share with you our excellent results for the first quarter, which reflect the ongoing strength and breadth of our product portfolio.
Demand from both businesses and consumers drove healthy revenue growth. We delivered record first quarter revenue, operating income and earnings per share.
We continue to control costs while prioritizing our investments into the highest growth opportunities, resulting in another quarter of margin expansion. As we discussed at our Analyst Meeting in July, we have eight core focus areas that we feel have the greatest opportunity to drive shareholder value.
This quarter, we had exceptional momentum across these focus areas and I want to start today's call by giving you some important highlights.
First, Microsoft Business Desktop is thriving with Enterprises and small- and medium-size businesses investing in our products and services. Not only are companies adopting Windows 7 and Office 2010 at historically high rates, they are also investing in our Office productivity platform, including SharePoint, Exchange, Dynamics CRM and Lync, the newly rebranded Office Communication server, all of which grew double digits this quarter.
Server and Database businesses had strong momentum as our data center and cloud offerings remain a top priority for our customers as they continue to adopt the Microsoft platform.
In addition, Windows Azure had strong subscription growth and we announced a number of platform enhancement this morning at our Professional Developers Conference.
As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, consumer demand for our products continue to drive terrific results this quarter. In terms of our core focus areas, Xbox momentum continued with our console outselling every competing console in the U.S. for the fourth consecutive month, being used at an all-time high with almost double the number of queries since its launch last year. And consumers continue to show their strong preference for Windows 7 and Office 2010.
Customer satisfaction across our products remains at record-high levels. We also made exciting progress in the mobile space with the recent launch of Windows Phone 7 in Europe and Asia and the upcoming November 8 launch in the U.S..
So in summary, I'm very pleased with our performance this quarter. We executed well in all of our core focus areas, and are off to a good start for the year.
With that, I'll hand it back to Bill to provide more details on the quarter's results.
Bill Koefoed
Thanks, Peter. I'll start today by noting that all of my comments are adjusted for the $1.5 billion of revenue, which was deferred in the first quarter of last year. As you probably recall, this deferral was related to the Windows 7 Upgrade Program and Windows 7 licenses sold in advance of general availability in the first quarter of last year.
We've reconciled this non-GAAP view to GAAP results in our earnings slide deck. All growth comparisons I make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless I specify otherwise. Okay, now to our results.
We started this fiscal year with great financial performance. Total revenue for the company was up 13% to $16.2 billion. Operating income and EPS grew 20% and 19%, respectively, again, outpacing revenue growth.
Bookings for the company were up an outstanding 24% this quarter. Bookings growth over the last three quarters was the highest in the last three years. Operating cash flow passed $8 billion for the first time ever, and was up 34%.
A number of the demand patterns and trends we saw in the second half of our fiscal year 2010 were sustained through the first quarter of 2011. In the first quarter, consumer demand for Office 2010 and Xbox were outstanding. And we're pleased with the continued adoption and growth of Windows 7 and Bing.
Sales to small and medium businesses were exceptionally strong with revenue up over 30%. This growth was partially due to a greater level of partner engagement as we had an increase of over 15% in the number of partners selling Microsoft products around the world.
We also saw strengthening trends in the Enterprise segment despite what is typically a seasonally weak quarter. Our compelling product portfolio across Windows, Server & Tools in the Microsoft Business  is driving increased Enterprise Agreement renewals.
Unearned revenue at the end of the quarter was $13.9 billion due to the strength in Enterprise Agreements. The contracted net build balance ended the quarter over $16 billion, significantly above prerecession levels. Geographically, emerging markets continue to significantly outperform the rest of the world. Growth in the U.S. and Europe remains stable and healthy.
We see customers of all sizes embracing cloud services from Microsoft. Organizations are leveraging our Commercial and Educational Online Services to run their businesses and institutions, while consumers are increasingly using services like Xbox Live, Windows Live and Office Web App. Microsoft has significant cloud momentum and we are leading the industry through this transformation.
Turning to the PC market. We estimate PCs grew between 9% and 11% in the first quarter. Consumer PCs grew single digits, while the business PCs grew mid-teens as the business hardware refresh remain strong.
From a geographic perspective, we estimate emerging market PCs grew over 3x the rate of mature markets. Regarding netbook trends, we have seen consumer shift from buying netbooks to low-end notebook, and we have not seen a material shift away from low-end PCs due to tablets in the market. Instead, we've predominantly seen consumers increase their number of devices and their usage scenarios.
Going forward, we see a strong pipeline of innovation from our partners for new Windows form factors. With that PC backdrop, I'll move on to the results for the Windows and Windows Live Division, which grew 10%.
Windows 7 drove the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth for the division. In the first quarter, Windows OEM revenue, which represents approximately 75% of the Windows and Windows Live division, was up 11%. In our earnings slide deck, we provide the usual bridge, from revenue usual revenue bridge to market, but in summary, the overall dynamics to the market were as expected with strength in business PCs and emerging markets.
Now let's move to Server & Tools, which posted a great quarter with 12% revenue growth. We estimate the underlying server hardware market grew mid-teens. Non-annuity revenue grew approximately 15% with Windows Server growing in line with the hardware market. Multiyear licensing revenue growth was roughly 10% and Enterprise Services grew 9%.
At the Financial Analysts Meeting in July, we discussed the assets and momentum of our Server & Tools portfolio. Let me provide some additional context to the underlying momentum and adoption this quarter.
As Peter mentioned, our data center and cloud offerings are top priority for businesses. We estimate Windows Server usage share grew 1.5 points, while at the same time Windows Server Premium mix grew four points. System center revenue growth grew over 20%. And within that, revenue from server virtualization suites grew over 50%. Our virtualization share continues to grow as ID reports Hyper V share of newly virtualized hosts double over the past year to 16.5%.
Windows Azure is gaining traction and has grown subscriptions 40% sequentially. This morning at PDC, we announced a number of platform enhancements, as Peter mentioned. These enhancements will help customers build new application and migrate existing applications to the cloud and allow developers and ISPs to build unique applications with the richest data set possible.
Next. I'll move to the Online Services division, which grew 8%. The online advertising component of this division grew 13%, primarily driven by our Search business, which again outperformed the market leader.
Yesterday, Bing reached a significant milestone with the Yahoo! partnership. Through diligent efforts on behalf of both companies, Bing is now powering Yahoo!'s algorithmic and case search results in the U.S. and Canada.
Turning to the Microsoft Business Division where revenue grew 14%. In the fourth quarter, I comment is that the markets' reception to Office 2010 has been phenomenal and the first quarter was no different. Consumer revenue grew 26% from continued launch momentum.
Office 2010's unit sales are 20% ahead of Office 2007 over the same time period. In addition, our three Office Web App now has more than 20 million users since our June launch. This business portion of MBD [ Microsoft Business Division] grew 11% with the non-annuity sales of Office 2010 up almost 50%.
We've seen strong demand from small and medium customers and PCs has rebounded from the year-ago levels. The multiyear licensing portion of the business grew about 5%. We've spoken with you about the Office productivity platform strategy, which includes Office, SharePoint, Exchange, Dynamics CRM and Lync, and we've seen strong momentum and renewal rate with our 2010 offering.
Let me give you some of the underlying product momentum in MBD. Lync grew 25% and the new version is expected to be available in our second fiscal quarter. Dynamic CRM, which just released a new beta this quarter, grew healthy double digits. Sales of Exchange and SharePoint, which are each $1 billion-plus businesses, also grew healthy double digits. Enterprises are adopting the entire business productivity infrastructure. They now have unparalleled choice when deploying their applications in their own data center or in the cloud.
During the quarter, we announced a number of significant cloud wins, including the city of New York last week. The number of business customers licensing our cloud services has more than tripled in the last year.
In education, we now have over 10,000 schools and 11 million students signed up for our Live@edu  service. On October 19, we announced the next generation of our cloud productivity service, Office 365. Office 365 brings together Lync, SharePoint, Exchange and Office Professional plus Desktop software in an always up-to-date cloud service, and is designed to meet the needs of organizations of all types and sizes.
From a business model perspective, Office 365 creates new profit growth opportunities for us and our partners and enables new scenarios that weren't viable in the past. With Office 365, we can reach more people, we will sell more to each customer and we will increase customer satisfaction. Office 365 will be available worldwide in calendar 2011.
Okay. Let's move on to the Entertainment and Devices division, which grew 27%, reflecting higher Xbox 360 platform revenue. We sold 2.8 million consoles this quarter, a unit increase of 38%. In the U.S., the new Xbox 360 console has outsold all other platforms since its introduction, resulting in a record first quarter shipment.
Halo Reach also had a solid launch this quarter, reaching approximately $350 million in revenue. The Halo effect extended to Xbox Live, which continues strong membership growth this quarter.
Windows Phone 7 launched last week in Europe and Asia and we eagerly anticipate the introduction in the U.S. on November 8.
Now let me cover the remainder of the income statement. Cost of goods sold increased 10% to $3.1 billion, driven primarily by increased Xbox hardware volume and online costs. Operating expenses were $5.9 billion in the quarter, an increase of 6%.
In the first quarter, we repurchased $4 billion of shares, returned $1.4 billion through dividend and increased our dividend rate 23%.
So in summary, we're off to a great financial start for the year with 24% bookings growth. We've seen strong business spending across Windows, Server & Tools and the Microsoft Business Division in both traditional and cloud offering, and our cloud momentum continued, our consumer momentum continued. And with that, I'll hand it back to Peter who's going to continue to discuss our business outlook.
Peter Klein
Great. Thanks, Bill. For the remainder of the call, I'll discuss our expectations for the second quarter and the remainder of fiscal 2011. According to many recent surveys, Enterprise IT spend should continue to grow for the remainder of the fiscal year. With the depth and breadth of our offerings, we are well-positioned to grow our share of the IT spending market.
We expect business PC and server hardware purchasing to remain the high priority for most businesses. The business PC refresh cycle should continue through at least the remainder of this fiscal year. As was the case this quarter, we expect business PC growth to outpace consumer PC growth, and emerging market growth to outpace developed market growth.
And we're confident that tablets will expand the PC market and we're enthusiastic about our opportunity, along with our partners, to bring Windows to additional form factors and new usage scenario. Windows will continue to provide the choice and value that customers want across devices.
With that back up, I'll now turn to segment expectation. Windows division revenue should go roughly in line with the PC market for the second quarter and the full year, when excluding the impact of the prior-year Tech Guarantee and revenue attributed to the launch spike.
For the second quarter of fiscal year 2010, you should exclude $1.7 billion of revenue related to the Tech Guarantee and $600 million of revenue related to the launch spike. For the full year, you should exclude $300 million and $700 million, respectively, the latest of these events.
Moving on to Server & Tools. For Q2 and the full year, we expect non-annuity revenue approximately 30% of the total, to generally track with the hardware market. Multiyear licensing revenue, approximately 50% of the total, should grow high-single digits for the second quarter and low-double digits for the full fiscal year.
Services, which is the remaining 20%, should grow mid-single digits for both the second quarter and the full fiscal year.
Turning to expectations for the Microsoft Business Division. Consumer and business non-annuity revenue, approximately 40% of the division's total revenue, should continue to track the PC shipment growth rates for the second quarter and the fiscal year.
We also expect revenue associated with multiyear agreements representing 60% of total revenue, to grow mid- to high-single digits for the second quarter and the fiscal year, as we slowly start to recognize the higher growth billings going on to the balance sheet.
When updating your model, you should remember that next quarter, in addition to the framework I just provided, you will also recognize approximately $220 million of deferred revenue related to Tech Guarantee.
For Q2 and the full fiscal year, we expect Online Services division revenue to outperform the online advertising market, reflecting continued organic revenue growth, as well as new revenue associated with our Yahoo! partnership. The majority of Yahoo!-related revenue will be recognized net traffic acquisition costs. We expect the benefits of the integration to occur gradually for the next several quarters.
And finally, in the Entertainment and Devices division, we're very excited about the launch of Windows Phone 7 and we anticipate that Connect will be the guest this holiday season. Considering the momentum and high-level of consumer interest in our offerings, we expect this division's revenue to go roughly 30% for the second quarter and in the mid-20s for the full fiscal year.
Switching to cost of goods sold expectations for the company, the biggest factor impacting COGS next quarter will be the expected and significant increase in hardware sales due to the upcoming launch of Kinect. Obviously, Xbox consoles and Kinect have a higher COGS profile relative to revenue than the rest of our business and you should consider this impacting your model.
Turning to operating expenses, we continue to prioritize our investment and remain diligent on cost controls. We are reconfirming our guidance of $26.9 billion to $27.3 billion for the full fiscal year. We expect the low interest-rate environment we experienced in the first quarter to continue through the second quarter and the fiscal year, and for investment income to be fairly consistent with the first quarter level.
We continue to expect capital expenditures for fiscal year 2011 to be about $2.5 billion. We expect our effective tax rate to be 23% to 24% for the second quarter and the remainder of the fiscal year.
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the second quarter, we expect unearned revenue to roughly follow historic seasonal patterns, excluding the $220 million impact of the Tech Guarantees.
So with that color for Q2 and the rest of our fiscal year, I want to close by saying that we are extremely pleased with the results we delivered this quarter. We executed well in all of our core focus areas. Products and services we brought to market over the past year are being embraced by our customers. And as a result, our product portfolio is as strong as it has ever been. This, combined with our continued prioritization of investment into the highest growth opportunities will help us drive long-term revenue and earnings per share growth.
With that, let's take some questions. Bill?
Bill Koefoed
Thanks, Peter. We want to get questions from as many of you as possible. So please stick to one question and avoid long or multipart questions. Barb, can you please go ahead, and repeat your instructions?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley.
Adam Holt - Morgan Stanley
My question is about Office. Obviously, also a very good start for 2010. As you look back at 2007 business growth, by which exceeded 20% for a number of quarters. As you think about the internals in terms of penetration and duration of this cycle, what are your early thoughts about how like they'd compared and where are you seeing evidence on successor on some of the bundling that you have talked about.
Peter Klein
Yes, at a high level, certainly, I'd point you to the guidance framework that we just talked about on what we expect relative to the business PC market. And obviously, the business hardware refresh is a great underlying driver for that business, as well as excitement around the product. And in terms of Office, I think the thing that's most encouraging for me is the breadth of the strength around and across all customer segments, whether that was small- and medium-size businesses and Enterprises. In terms of the integration story, Bill touched on the strong growth across all of those businesses and I think you're really starting to see that resonate very well with customers. And in fact, as we had anticipated when we were talking about anticipating off of 2010, and that was going to be a key part of the story and I think we're starting to see that play out early days, which I think can sustain for a while.
Operator
And next is Heather Bellini with ISI Group.
Heather Bellini - ISI Group Inc.
Peter, I was wondering, you mentioned that the Enterprise 7 -- Windows 7 Enterprise Upgrade cycle would last at least through the end of fiscal '11. And I guess I'm just wondering if you could share with us how the upgrade cycle itself is tracking versus your expectations from a few quarters ago?
Peter Klein
Yes, I would say two things. One, just in terms of Enterprise's desire to upgrade, very strong, sort of high level. I think what we're seeing is people actually doing their deployments a little bit faster than I think we expected than we'd seen in the past. In terms of the overall business, obviously we're seeing Enterprise and businesses refresh their hardware, which is obviously a great thing in terms of the Windows 7 business.
Operator
The next is Walter Pritchard with Citi.
Walter Pritchard - Citigroup Inc
Bill, Peter, I'm wondering if you could talk a bit about just Enterprise Agreements in general. And we're certainly not back to a normal economic environment but your performance there, especially the improvements over the last several quarters here seems to suggest that maybe you are getting back to kind of normal behavior from customers despite headcount being pressured. I'm just wondering if you can talk to us about what you're seeing as the drivers of growth in that part of the business more generally?
Peter Klein
I think you're seeing the console and some several things. Obviously, one is just macroeconomics and businesses investing in IT again. And I think the other is that our product portfolio, and through the combination of those two things has gotten Enterprises really wanting to invest both in their IT infrastructure and in our portfolio of products. And so as we had hoped in the course of the last year, we thought those two things might come together. The last thing I'll say is the accelerated interest in the cloud. It's when you add on top of it where we've come in terms of our cloud offerings and what that means for Enterprises as they think about investing for the long term. They want to invest with somebody who can make the transition from their own premise infrastructure to the cloud as soon as possible. And I think you're seeing that as well. So the conversations that we're having always included our new product portfolio, as well as our cloud offerings. And I think that taking into account the better macroeconomic environment has all come together to really drive a better environment.
Operator
And next is Sarah Friar with Goldman Sachs.
Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
Peter, on the cost side, you have tremendous operating margins this quarter. As you look forward, you maintained the cost goal for the full year. Is that an anticipation of what's coming around the Windows Phone launch and Connect, or are there ways to continue to see you be a lot more efficient on the cost side over the next couple of quarters?
Peter Klein
As you know, we're always looking at ways to get as efficient as we can on the cost. And right now, we're executing against the plan, we feel very good about our plans we've been talking about over the last couple of quarters. And first quarter was good, and we continue to executing at that plan. I'm not seeing in Q2, we do have some launches coming out and that was always in our plan and those are starting off and going on very well.
Operator
And next is from Brent Thill with UBS.
Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank
Peter, if you could drill one level deeper in the covered to an inning, maybe give us a sense of what inning you think we're in, in terms of the corporate upgrade?
Peter Klein
In our guidance, we talked about the rest of this year. I think we have to see how that plays out. That's sort of where we have visibility and what we're talking about. But certainly, over the last couple of quarters, looking forward over the next couple of quarters and then talking to customers in what they're looking to invest in, clearly our priority is investing in refreshing their hardware and the related Microsoft products that come along with that.
Operator
And next is Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.
Philip Winslow - Crédit Suisse AG
Just wanted to focus on the Server & Tools division for a minute. Peter, what are your OEM partner's telling you about just where we stand in the server refresh cycle and how much do they see these sort of being high growth as what we're seeing in service and should either continuing or not continuing into next year?
Peter Klein
Similar to PCs, I think it's a similar dynamic. These businesses are investing broadly in their infrastructure whether that's PCs or servers. And on our outlook, we talked about how we expect that to continue for the rest of this fiscal year. So it's very similar to what we just talked about in terms of the PC refresh.
Operator
And next is Katherine Egbert with Jefferies.
Katherine Egbert - Jefferies & Company, Inc.
And if I do some math, I come up with about 40% of you revenue coming from all consumer sources and about 60% business. It looks like the consumer revenue was about flat year-on-year and the business revenues growing high teens. Is that accurate?
Peter Klein
Well, yes. It's hard to answer that question because I don't know exactly your math. I will point out a couple of key highlights on the consumer side. If you look at Entertainment and Devices, the Xbox growth of 27%. That's something that we feel really good about and gives us great momentum heading into the holidays with Kinect, and the same thing with our Search revenue outgrowing the market. So those are the sort of the key highlight.
Bill Koefoed
And Consumer and Office was up 26%
Peter Klein
Correct. So we actually feel really good about the consumer revs. It's hard to answer that specific question without ...
Bill Koefoed
We feel good about the business growth so it was a good quarter for both.
Operator
And next is Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.
Kash Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch
It's good to see the cash flow and the operating margins, also you bought back a ton of stock in the quarter. My question is about growth. I just want to answer this from a quantitative standpoint. Incrementally rounded to the last two quarters, what's your confidence level in your growth there? I just noticed some of the forward-looking indicators, your business tends to lag with all the spending because you have this annuity model for the most part. Look at the unbilled portion, and that's at a record high. You're renewals, you better priced better than before. The first half have given nicely. What is your incremental confidence with respect to your revenue growth rate considering expenses tied up, I would assume that there's a lot of operating leverage for that incremental revenue. Talk to us about your confidence in your revenue growth outlook?
Peter Klein
Obviously, we feel pretty good. We had such a strong performance in the business side. And that flow through, if you look at our outlook on the annuity side to your point, we've slightly increased our annuity revenue outlook in MBD and STD, which reflects the strength in the billings that we've seen. And as you pointed out, it takes time for that to flow through to the income statement and it will throughout the rest of the year.
Operator
And next is John DiFucci with JPMorgan Chase.
John DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co
Peter, my question has to do with PC market, PC sales, unit sales. You and your Windows OEM revenue bridge, which is always very helpful. You start off from PC market with 10% growth. But industry analysts are coming out and I know, you're not doing their work, but it's actually quite different from what we've seen out there from an industry analysts by about 2.5%, in this quarter, which is a bigger range than we usually see. Just wondering, can you just help us out a little bit with that because little things come out throughout the quarter and we take a look at those, and we realize that a lot of your, at least the Windows business and also MBD and with the Office is driven by that, fairly significantly driven by that. Any comments on that, the difference?
Bill Koefoed
Actually, John, I'll take that. So IDC said 10% and Gartner said 8%, so our range of 9% to 11% was slightly higher than Gartner's and IDC is within the mid-range. So we feel like our analysis of the PC market obviously, we look at those data points as well as others, which is completely in line. So happy to talk to you about it after the call, one-on-one, call down if you want.
Operator
And the next question comes from Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo.
Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
I just have a question on Windows 7. The premium mix was pretty good this quarter. I'm just curious, in light of your commentary about the Enterprise adoption cycle, it's fair to say you're anticipating sort of similar levels pointing out there in terms of how that percentage mix plays out for the rest of the year?
Bill Koefoed
Yes, generally speaking, the biggest factor in premium mix is going to be the business mix, and as we talked about, we expected those dynamics to continue for the rest of this year.
Operator
And next is Brad Reback with Oppenheimer.
Brad Reback - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.
So Bill, I think you had highlighted earlier in the call the big win with the Office 365 product at New York. It was a fairly competitive bid, it looks like. Could you guys maybe talk to what the economics of that look like to you from a profitability standpoint over the life of that contract? Clearly, a lot of consumers as people move to the cloud that, that could negatively impact the P&L. So maybe you could talk to a real world example.
Peter Klein
Bill touched a little bit on the business model. We talked about this a little bit at our Analyst Meeting. These kind of wins and these cloud deals, it provides totally new economic opportunity for us. These are scenarios that we're not in today. In many cases, their customers have that customers today. In some cases, it's revenue than we may have for them to think us that we're not getting. Sitting in New York is a perfect example. We have others like Starbucks and others, where we're addressing totally new scenarios, Azure is a great example of that. It  really increases our penetration in that market. Similarly, we've talked about how in the mid-market we can really increase our penetration services like this. So that's sort of our business model how it creates economic profit for us.
Operator
And next is Edward Maguire with CLSA.
Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.
Looking at the double-digit growth in your Business division products, could you talk about what's driving that and how closely that growth may be linked to the Windows 7 activity?
Peter Klein
Yes, it's not really tied to the Windows 7 activity. It's more a function of the product cycle with Office 2010 and all the related products like SharePoint and Exchange and Lync. And as we touched on briefly before, so if the confluence of the macroeconomic environment picking up and Enterprises investing in their infrastructure, they're seeing the value that you'd get the increased productivity and the cost savings that you get. And that's what's really driving the interest in those products, and new versions of those products that just introduce capabilities that manufactures really want.
Operator
And our last question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company.
Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC
Peter, you mentioned that the Windows Server Premium mix was up four points. So I think you're now at 29%. And I believe that at least a few quarters back, Microsoft has suggested that it would be difficult to get this above 30%. Is that still kind of the ceiling we should be thinking about? Or do you think given this momentum that you could drive the premium mix higher than that?
Peter Klein
Well, first thing I'd say is the premium mix is over 20%. We haven't given an exact number on that. It's probably, I think it's best to continue to track it and not sort of set a ceiling or an expectation for it.
Bill Koefoed
Okay, so that will wrap up our Q&A portion of today's earnings call.
As many of you know, today's a busy day for us here in Redmond, as we have PDC going on here. I'd encourage you, if you haven't, to look into the replays of the keynotes that we've done at PDC.

I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Koefoed, General Manager, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Bill Koefoed

Okay. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Peter.
Peter Klein
Thanks, Bill and good afternoon, everyone. I’m very pleased to share with all of you our strong financial results. We achieved record revenue, operating income, and earnings per share for both the fourth quarter and the full year.
This quarter, our strong revenue performance was both broad and deep, with every business achieving double-digit growth. Strong sales execution closed the year with fourth quarter bookings increasing 27%. For the year, both the Windows Division and Server and Tools Business achieved record revenue.
We are equally enthusiastic about the customer and product momentum we’ve achieved this year across the breadth of our portfolio. Of course, I have to start by noting Windows 7, which has received tremendous market response. With 175 million licenses sold to date, it is the fastest selling operating system ever and now runs on over 15% of all PCs worldwide.
Capitalizing on the recovery of the server hardware market, Windows Server 2008 R2 has enjoyed strong demand and increased Windows Server market share.
With the launches of Exchange 2010 and, most recently, SharePoint 2010 and Office 2010, we delivered key innovations in our productivity portfolio.
Equally as important for our long-term growth, we made significant strides in our cloud initiatives by bringing Windows Azure to market and by increasing customer traction with our commercial online services. Throughout the year, we continued to update and enhance Bing, which has now achieved 13 consecutive months of market share growth.
And finally, we focused on consumers with our new Xbox 360 consoles and the announcements of Kinect and Windows Phone 7, coming to market this holiday season.
Meanwhile, as a result of our ongoing commitment to managing costs, we held annual operating expenses roughly flat. Our continued revenue strength and cost discipline drove yet another consecutive quarter of margin expansion and record annual profits in the Windows Division, Server and Tools Business, and Entertainment and Devices Division, as well as the company in total.
We grew full-year operating income by almost $4 billion and generated operating cash flow of $24 billion. Of this amount, we returned about two-thirds, or almost $16 billion, to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases and dividends.
Finally, I’m particularly pleased by our growth in earnings per share of 50% for the fourth quarter and 30% for the full year. So, it’s been a great fiscal year and an outstanding fourth quarter.
With those remarks, I’ll now turn the call over to Bill to provide more details on the quarter.
Bill Koefoed
Thanks Peter. As I review this quarter’s performance, keep in mind all growth comparisons relate to the corresponding period of last year unless I specify otherwise.
As Peter noted in his opening remarks, we finished the year with terrific financial results. Total revenue for the quarter grew 22% to over $16 billion, a record fourth quarter result. Windows, Online Services, Entertainment and Devices, Server and Tools, the Business Division, each of our operating segments grew revenue double digits this quarter, reflecting broad-based strength across all of our businesses.
Fourth quarter GAAP operating income grew 49%, while EPS grew 50%. Looking at the full year and adjusting for the tech guarantees, we had four consecutive quarters of margin expansion with EPS growing faster than revenue every quarter.
Operating cash flow was up 46% to a fourth-quarter record $5.6 billion. As for the year, operating cash flow surpassed $24 billion as Peter noted, also a record. Customer demand was strong across the breadth of the Microsoft portfolio this quarter, as we saw total bookings growth accelerate to 27%.
In the enterprise, businesses continue to invest in and commit to the Microsoft platform. Sales execution and enterprise agreement renewal rates have improved as unearned revenue at the end of the quarter was $14.8 billion, up a very healthy 21% sequentially. The contracted not billed balance ended the year over a record $15 billion. The small and mid-market customer segment continued to experience robust growth and was up approximately 20%.
Finally, continuing a trend this year, consumer demand was fantastic with growth in Windows, Office, Search, and Xbox.
Geographically, we saw strength across all regions, led by emerging markets. Growth in the U.S. improved this quarter, while demand in Europe remained healthy. The PC market continues to thrive and we estimate the market grew between 22% and 24%, with both consumer and business growing in the same range. From a geographic perspective, emerging markets remain a significant driver of the PC market with almost twice the growth of mature markets.
With that PC backdrop, I’ll move on to the Windows and Windows Live Division.
Windows revenue grew over a billion dollars or 32% this quarter when adjusted for the Windows tech guarantee last year. Total OEM license growth was 26% and outpaced the PC market for the third quarter in a row. Consumer and business licenses both grew approximately 26%. The business PC refresh cycle has accelerated and we recorded the second straight quarter of double-digit business license growth.
As in past quarters, to help you bridge PC growth to OEM revenue growth, we have provided a reconciliation slide in our earnings deck.
At 31% growth, adjusted Windows OEM revenue outgrew PC shipments by 7 percentage points this quarter. The hardware segment mix was a 3-point headwind to revenue growth. As I mentioned earlier, emerging markets continue to outpace mature markets. Windows attach and inventory drove 6 percentage points of growth. We exited the quarter with normal inventory levels and continue to benefit from solid attach gains in both business and consumer. Finally, upsell and channel dynamics drove 7 percentage points of growth, reflecting a higher Windows 7 offering mix.
Enterprise adoption of Windows 7 accelerated and the non-OEM portion of the Windows Division grew 36%, driven by an increase in volume licensing to businesses and retail sales of Windows 7. Clearly, the Windows franchise is thriving. Importantly, customer satisfaction for Windows 7 is incredibly high at 94% and businesses are deploying Window 7 in the enterprise. In the browser, IE 8 is now the fastest growing and most popular web-browser in the market, with IE 9 coming soon.
Now let’s move to Server and Tools which posted 14% revenue growth in the fourth quarter and had a record year with $14.9 billion of revenue. We estimate the underlying server hardware market grew 25% to 28%. Non-annuity revenue grew approximately 20%. Windows Server grew with the market, while SQL Server 2008 R2 and Visual Studio developer tools also contributed to the growth.
Annuity revenue, which is approximately 50% of the business, grew about 15% with improved enterprise demand. From a product perspective, Windows Server, SQL Server, and System Center all experienced double-digit growth. Enterprise Services, about 20% of revenue, grew 3%.
Windows Server continues to gain share as businesses replace and procure new hardware in the datacenter. We estimate Windows Server grew its market share over 1 percentage point while at the same time increasing premium mix to about 25%. Our virtualization suites almost doubled this quarter.
In addition to the share gains in the traditional server market, Microsoft is leading the way to the cloud with our Windows Azure services platform. Just last week at the Worldwide Partner Conference, we unveiled a number of new cloud innovations and partnerships, further increasing the alignment between our on-premise Windows Server, SQL Server, and System Center products with the Azure platform.
Next I’ll move on the Online Services Division, which grew 13%. The Online advertising component of the division grew 19%, primarily driven by our search business, which again outperformed the market. We continue to be encouraged by Bing’s ongoing share gains, due to the pace of exciting innovation and differentiation it brings to market. June marked the 13th consecutive month of share gains in the U.S., which is now up over 4 points since launch.
Turning to the Microsoft Business Division, revenue grew 15% and Office 2010 is off to a great start. Consumer revenue, which includes OEM and retail, grew 51% following the launch of Office 2010, heading into the back-to-school season. The business portion of MBD grew 8%. Non-annuity license sales jumped 15%, trending towards PC shipment growth as expected. The annuity licensing portion of the business grew 6%, driven by an increase in enterprise demand.
Office and the integration with SharePoint, Office Communications Server, and Dynamics CRM had strong demand and each of these products grew double digits this quarter. The cloud enhances these productivity scenarios, and our customers are purchasing suites of our online services at an increasing pace. 70% of our Business Productivity Online seats represent new business to Microsoft.
Let’s move on to the Entertainment and Devices Division which grew 27%. Gaming revenue grew 30% as we sold 1.5 million consoles, a unit increase of 26%, taking share as we grew faster than the overall market. Xbox Live continues to be a tremendous asset with over 25 million members. This year marked the first time that Xbox Live Digital Marketplace revenue exceeded subscription revenue, illustrating the service’s increasing level of customer engagement and monetization. Non-gaming revenue was up 23%, driven by growth in Windows Embedded and sales of PC accessories that generally align to PC market growth.
This quarter at E3, we unveiled Kinect, the Xbox 360 motion sensor which will enable you to play games, and control your music and movies with just your voice or the wave of your hand, no controller required. Earlier this week, we announced product and pricing for the all new Kinect experience. The Kinect experience, with more than 15 games available this holiday, begins in North America on November 4.
Now, let me cover the remainder of the income statement. Foreign exchange had a 2% positive impact to revenue this quarter. We experienced a headwind from the euro as one would expect, but this was more than offset by our hedging program and the dollar weakening in other currencies.
Cost of goods sold increased 23% to $3.2 billion, driven primarily by increased online costs, royalties, and other charges. Operating expenses were $6.9 billion in the quarter, under our guidance range, and we are very pleased with the Q4 execution and fiscal discipline. Headcount decreased 4% year-over-year. We repurchased $3.8 billion of shares and paid $1.1 billion of dividends.
So, to wrap up, our product cycle momentum continues with the release of Office 2010 and the breadth of our portfolio which drove record results. Our cost discipline remains strong. In the cloud, we had great momentum and are seeing businesses invest in the Microsoft platform. And with that, I’ll hand it back to Peter, who’s going to discuss our business outlook.
Peter Klein
Thanks, Bill. I will now share our thoughts on the first quarter and total fiscal year 2011. We are entering the year with great momentum. We are encouraged by the resurgence in business PC shipments, and expect the business PC refresh cycle to continue through fiscal year 2011. The recent refresh of our enterprise product has positioned us well to meet customers’ needs as they return to investing in information technology.
Turning to our outlook by business, we expect Windows division revenue to grow roughly in line with PC shipments for the first quarter and full year, excluding the $7 million revenue impact from the Windows 7 retail launch and $276 million from the technology guarantee revenue carried over from fiscal year 2009.
For the Microsoft business division, consumer and business non-annuity revenue, approximately 40% of the total, should continue to track with their PC shipment growth rates for the first quarter and full year. Annuity revenue for the first quarter and full year should grow low to mid-single digits.
Moving to the Server and Tools business, in the first quarter we expect non-annuity revenue to be up mid to high-single digits as first-quarter bookings are sales cycle driven, and tend to be the softest seasonal quarter irrespective of hardware shipments. For the full year, we expect non-annuity revenue to generally track with the hardware market. We expect annuity revenue to grow roughly high single digits for the first quarter and full year. Enterprise services revenue should grow mid single digits.
For the Online Services Division, our online advertising business should outperform the overall online advertising market. Regarding our search partnership with Yahoo!, we are working closely with them to migrate both algorithmic and pay traffic in North America to this holiday season.
And finally, I will cover the Entertainment and Devices Division. Based upon the compelling wave of consumer offerings coming to market, we expect revenue will grow in the mid-teens for the first quarter and full year, following its normal seasonal skew to the first-half of the year.
Moving to cost of goods sold, gross margins will be impacted by product mix, and particularly by the increase in hardware sales that will drive growth in the Entertainment and Devices Division. We remain focused on diligently managing our cost structure and are lowering our full year operating expense guidance to between $26.9 billion and $27.3 billion, which includes our estimate of Yahoo! search integration expenses.
We expect our effective tax rate to remain approximately 25%. Switching to the balance sheet, we expect that the first quarter unearned revenue balance will track to normal historical patterns on a sequential basis, after adjusting for the impact of tech guarantees in the prior year.
Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2011 will be about $2.5 billion. This will be the second year in a row in which CapEx spending will be lower than depreciation expense. We will continue to generate strong free cash flow and remain committed to returning capital to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.
So in summary, I’m very pleased by our outstanding financial results for the quarter and the full year. We have great product momentum in the market with strong business and consumer demand for our most recent wave of products. With the exciting pipeline of consumer products arriving to market this holiday season, we are well positioned to continue this momentum this coming year.
On that note, I am looking forward to seeing all of you at our financial analyst meeting next week, and I will now return the call to Bill so that we can begin taking your questions.
Bill Koefoed
Thanks Peter. We want to get questions from as many of you as possible, so please stick to one question and avoid long or multipart questions. Barb, can you please go ahead and repeat your instructions.

Okay, thank you. (Operator Instructions). And first is Walter Pritchard with Citigroup.
Walter Pritchard – Citigroup
Hi, I was wondering if you could elicit a little bit on the PC side your assumptions for fiscal ’11, and just talk about tablets and how you are thinking about that market. Are you talking about growing in line with traditional PCs, and what impact do you think tablets will have on the market, and what maybe your share in that area and how does that affect your growth rate?
Peter Klein
Yes. We are very excited about the market; the PC is the PC market excluding tablets. But obviously we are super happy with both the state of the PC market and the customer traction for Windows 7. You know, we think tablets are very interesting and remind us that there are always new scenarios and new opportunities, and we are constantly working with our partners and our OEM partners.
In fact, I think one of the things that has driven the PC market and Windows growth this year has been the work we have done with our OEM partners on multiple scenarios and form factors and price points in all those. Tablets, I think, are interesting and great because I think they sort of enlarge the overall opportunity. I think they are additive to the opportunity, and again it reminds us that there are lots of interesting new scenarios that we are continuing to work on, and so we are excited by that.

Next is Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley.
Adam Holt – Morgan Stanley
Great. Thank you. It looks like an overly good start to Office, 8% business growth was the highest number I think you have seen in two years. Do you think business revenue growth can get to the same levels you saw with the previous Office cycle; we were each north of 20%. And why wouldn’t the annuity business for Office grow faster the low single digits in the heart of the cycle next year? Thanks.
Peter Klein
Yes, thanks Adam. You know, I’m not going to give guidance on business revenue rather than the driver framework that we gave. In terms of the annuity business, obviously this is in terms of the deferred revenue we had the last year, year and a half, has been slow and so we’re kind of digging out of that hole, the recognitions that we have from the deferred revenue balance.
And so in the course of this year, we will be building that backup. And as I said, we expect Q1 unearned revenue to also return to normal historical sequential pattern. So we feel good about the opportunity to continue to drive bookings with Office, but in terms of the annuity revenue recognized growth that is impacted by sort of the billings that we saw over the course of the last year, but having said that we are certainly very optimistic about business uptake of Office 2010.
Adam Holt – Morgan Stanley
Terrific, thank you.

Heather Bellini – ISI
Hi, yes, good afternoon. I was wondering if you guys could talk about the decline in the consumer premium mix, and what percentage of the decline is related to emerging markets and what are the other reasons if it doesn’t explain all of it? Thanks.
Peter Klein
Thanks Heather, all of it. It is all related to the growth in emerging markets.

And next is Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse.
Philip Winslow – Credit Suisse
Hi, guys. Great quarter. I just wanted to have one question back on the windows division, if you look at that commercial and retail license line, it still remained very strong year-over-year and even sequentially. Obviously, in the first part of fiscal year that was driven by consumers upgrading to Windows 7, just what are you seeing there? Then also, as we start to think about fiscal ’11, obviously that does include commercial licenses too, what would you expect for the impact of potentially enterprises upgrading to Windows 7 and sort of on top of I guess the PC replacement cycle. Thanks.
Peter Klein
No, it is great. We are very optimistic about that opportunity, but remember it is a small part of the business, about 20% of the business. So, while there is great intent to deploy, and we are already seeing great deployment, so that is a little bit of a tailwind, but it is not by any stretch of imagination a material mover of the business, but it is a nice additive.
Bill Koefoed
Barb, next question please.

Next is Sarah Friar from Goldman Sachs.
Sarah Friar – Goldman Sachs
Great. Thanks for taking my question guys, two questions. Just first, on the overall environment, you sound incredibly upbeat, you clearly had a very strong quarter, was there any shift as you got towards the end of the quarter, because clearly others through earnings have started to note more weakness in Europe, for example, our government spending. So we just love to get your perspective.
Peter Klein
Yes, we didn’t really see any differences throughout the quarter, and we are encouraged. We had strong demand and strong sales execution, and obviously, it did slightly better than we had hoped and talked about last quarter. For our products set though, we’re thrilled with customers adopting our products. And there was really no difference throughout the quarter.
Sarah Friar – Goldman Sachs
So, it sounds like with the product cycle, your kind of expectation is you can kick through even some slight decline on the macro side?
Peter Klein
Yes, we certainly feel really good about the traction that our products had, no doubt.
Sarah Friar – Goldman Sachs
Great. Thanks.

And next is Brent Thill with UBS.
Brent Thill – UBS
Peter, you are continuing your strong expense discipline in the quarter, I am just curious if you could talk about fiscal ’11, and what really changes as we go into next year to continue that discipline? You did take your expense guidance down a little relative to your past guidance, if you could just explain what drove that?
Peter Klein
Yes, it is the same thing. This is an ongoing process, something we think about every day, and so continually as we go through we are always scrubbing. We are always looking at our plans, we’re always looking to make the most effective use of the money, and as we have done that and we make progress, then we can lower our guidance, and that is just what we did. We did better in Q4 then we expected, and we are continuing to take that into next year, and we will just focus on that continuously.
Bill Koefoed
Thanks Brent. Operator, next question.

The next is Katherine Egbert with Jefferies.
Katherine Egbert – Jefferies & Company
Hi, good afternoon. Your contracted but not billed balance was up 1.5 billion this quarter, can you tell us about that?
Peter Klein
Yes. I mean, as we said it was strong bookings quarter all up, if you look at the revenue and the unearned and the CMB [ph]. You know, our bookings growth was 27%, and so it is reflective of the sales execution and the enterprise demand for our products, and it is interesting, Bill has kind of touched on that, it was very broad-based across geographies and across products and across customer segments and size. And so that is what is really driving that.
Katherine Egbert – Jefferies & Company
Will that continue to increase?
Peter Klein
You know, I would just – we haven’t given guidance on that. We did give the expectations on the unearned. So, I would take that as bit of a proxy for how things are going.
Katherine Egbert – Jefferies & Company
Okay, thanks Peter.
Peter Klein
Thank you.
Bill Koefoed
Next question Barb.
Operator
And next is Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.
Kash Rangan – Merrill Lynch
Hi, thank you very much. Looking at the unearned balance for server and tools and MBD, it looks like it is back up to multi-quarter highs, and also your unearned metric which you reported is well above what it has been, the highest it has been in eight quarters. Yet, at the same time the guidance for the annuity and growth rate, it still sounds like we are in recession listening to your guidance for what seems to be low to mid single digits.
Can you help us understand the disconnect here? It seems to me that you are being a little bit conservative with your annuity guidance for what seems to be two big product lines. Given the improvement in bookings off-balance sheet and on balance sheet, it occurs to me that as the deferred revenue starts to build up in your words, and there is normal seasonality that you should take your guidance up in the next few quarters. So, comments or reactions, an explanation would be appreciated. Thank you.
Peter Klein
Yes, what you are seeing Kash is the – it is the recognition next year, a function of the deferreds that we’ve had. As you mentioned, this is the first quarter where we really pumped it up. So the recognitions in the annuity revenue that you are seeing next year in the reported number is a function of the challenges we had on our deferred balance. And so as we build that up over time, you will start to see the annuity business probably do better. So that is what you will see as you get towards the latter part of next year, because this is the first quarter where we really saw that unearned balance kick off.
Kash Rangan – Merrill Lynch
So, if the deferreds continue to build up normal seasonality, should – we should expect you to take your guidance up for annuity growth rate in your two main businesses, right?
Peter Klein
You know, it is too early to tell. You should just take the guidance that we gave as our guidance for FY11.
Kash Rangan – Merrill Lynch
Okay, great. Thanks.

Next is Brad Reback with Oppenheimer.
Brad Reback – Oppenheimer
Hi guys. How are you?
Peter Klein
Good.
Brad Reback – Oppenheimer
So, Peter in the slides on 18, you talked about COGS being sort of negatively impacted next year, based on the expectation of mid-teen growth in E&D, can you give us any sense of what the headwind is on the COGS side?
Peter Klein
Well, what I tried to do is give you the drivers, and I think, you know, you should go through your model, think about what assumptions you are going to make and clearly the assumptions, the biggest one that we like to call out that we think is most material by far is the growth in E&D and the headwind from the hardware sales, which is obviously a great thing for the long term, but in the short term will provide a headwind to COGS. And so, the reason we like to give you the drivers, it allows you the flexibility to kind of work that through your models as you come up with your product mix.
Brad Reback – Oppenheimer
I understand, not to pick you, but you did put the mid-teen guidance out there, so based on that there is no way to give us any sense of what type of headwind that generates, so we’re all on the same page here.
Peter Klein
I will just say, Brad, do the math. And I think it will come out whatever your assumptions are for the driver framework. So, let us move on to the next question.
Operator
And next is Sandeep Aggarwal with Caris & Company.
Sandeep Aggarwal – Caris & Company
Hi, thanks for taking my question. Peter, you know, we are in the mid of enterprise refresh and you know, premium mix for business edition has gone up from 28% to 29%, but if I look at the historical trend during the mid of enterprise refresh, actually you have been in mid to late 30s in terms of the business premium mix. You know, why it has only seen only 100 basis points improvement or is there a time maybe in the next few quarters where we can see it reaching to the historical level.
Peter Klein
Yes, I would say, one, it is early in the refresh cycle. So, we should watch it. I think that really is the answer.
Bill Koefoed
Next question please Barb.
Operator
And next is Ed Maguire from CLSA.
Ed Maguire – CLSA
Yes, good afternoon. Last quarter, you provided some metrics around your online services subscription, can you provide some at least directional indications and help us understand as well some of the traction around Azure and how that may be impacting some of the traditional server revenues.
Peter Klein
Yes, we talked about on the sort of commercial – the productivity online services as Bill talked about, you know, 70% of those wins have been competitive wins, which has just been really good. We’re really accelerating the traction there. On the Azure side, it is early, we just launched that this year. The productivity online services are further along from a customer perspective, but we have really accelerated the developers and the users we have on the Azure platform. It is not material to the financials now, but we are really sort of establishing a leadership position in that of users.
And we have had some – on the productivity side, we have had some great wins, we had the State of Kentucky, which was many, many – 700,000 users. So, acceleration and continued progress and leadership in that.

Gregg Moskowitz – Cowen
Okay, thank you. Good afternoon guys. Just a follow up on Office 2010, qualitatively Peter, how are you thinking about consumer and enterprise adoption rates in the first 12 months or so post release as compared with the similar period, with regard to Office 2007?
Peter Klein
Yes, you should just take the guidance that we gave you on the non-annuity side. We sort of expected to track PC shipments, which is a pretty strong result, especially given some mix of PCs to emerging markets where we have slightly lower cash. So we will – this quarter will be a big quarter, we'll look at the back-to-school and see how we are doing. But other than that, we are very excited – off to a great start; as you saw, the 51% number is a very strong number for early on.
Bill Koefoed
And Barb – Barb, let's move on. Let's make this the last question.
Operator
And the last question comes from Rob Breza with RBC Capital Markets.
Rob Breza – RBC Capital Markets
Hi, thanks for sneaking me in. Just quickly, maybe as a follow-up to Gregg's question, as you look at the PC shipments, your expectations for Q1 are helpful. If we look at the trend kind of in the second half of the year, would it be natural to assume after back-to-school holiday season that we see a slight tail-off or can you just give us kind of maybe a front-half kind of second-half thought? Thanks.
Peter Klein
We are not giving color on sort of half-by-half. The one thing I would say that will continue all year is that emerging markets will continue to grow faster than developed markets and that has an impact on our business.
Rob Breza – RBC Capital Markets
Great. Thank you.

Okay, Peter, it’s all yours.
Peter Klein
Thanks, Bill. Good afternoon everyone. Our third quarter results reflect our strong product momentum, continued focus on controlling costs and the beginning stages of a return in business hardware spending. This quarter we generated record third quarter revenues and operating cash flow.
In addition, as a result of revenue growth and our ongoing focus on cost management, when adjusting for the impact of the Tech Guarantee programs this year. We had our third consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion.
Strong demand for Windows 7 is a primary contributor to our performance. As evidence of that strong demand both internal and external checks show that over 10% of all PCs worldwide are already running Windows 7.
While reaching this level of penetration in six months qualifies Windows 7 as our fastest selling operating system ever, it also illustrates how much opportunity still remains. As I have met with investors, I’ve commented on the tremendous product momentum we have, which was evidenced this quarter across all our businesses.
Bing achieved 10 consecutive months of market share growth since its launch and both the U.S. Department of Justice and the European Commission cleared our search agreement with Yahoo!
Azure, our cloud development platform became commercially available in 41 countries. In the mobile space, we announced Windows Phone 7 and Kin. At last Friday, we released Office 2010 to manufacturing and are looking forward to its launch in June.
All of this was achieved while continuing to focus on managing costs and prioritizing our investments. As a result, we delivered operating income and earnings per share growth ahead of revenue growth with earnings per share of 36% over last year. We also returned $3.1 billion of cash to investors through dividends and stock repurchases.
So in summary, I’m pleased with our continuing performance this quarter. We had great momentum with current products in market. We have a very exciting pipeline of new products to come and we continued to deliver strong financial results.
I’ll now hand the call back to Bill to give you some additional details on the quarter and then come back and provide some thoughts on our outlook for our fourth quarter and the next fiscal year.
Bill Koefoed
Thanks Peter. As I review this quarter’s performance, keep in mind that all growth comparisons relate to the corresponding quarter of last year unless I specify otherwise. As Peter said, we had another strong quarter.
Overall, GAAP revenue grew 6% to $14.5 billion. During the quarter we deferred $305 million of revenue related to the Microsoft Office 2010 Technology Guarantee program. Adjusting for this amount, revenue would have been $14.8 billion, 8% growth over the prior year period.
GAAP operating income grew 17% year-over-year, while EPS grew 36%. Operating cash flow this quarter was $7.4 billion, an all time record for the company. Foreign exchange had a positive impact to revenue of about $200 million this quarter.
In terms of overall revenue mix, geographically emerging markets grew more than 20%, while mature markets grew mid single digits. While consumer demand continued to be strong, we saw renewed strength from small and mid-market customers with year-over-year growth of more than 15%.
Within the enterprise customer segment, we saw the beginning of a recovery in IT hardware spend but as we’ve discussed on past calls, we continued to see lengthened sales cycles. Enterprise agreement renewal rates, taking into consideration the extended sales cycles are within our historical range.
Unearned revenue was $12.3 billion, down sequentially as is typical, but better than last year’s seasonal trend and roughly flat year-over-year. Our unearned revenue balance would have been up more than $100 million or 1% year-over-year when considering the recognition of undelivered elements, primarily associated with our prior Windows XP sales and the revenue deferral from our Office 2010 Technology Guarantee program.
Multiyear annuity billings were up mid single digits year-over-year. This quarter’s growth from volume licensing is beginning to offset the unearned revenue declines we’ve seen over the past several quarters as we rebuild our unearned balance.
Now for the PC market. Windows 7 and innovation from our OEM partners continued to fuel demand for PCs. We estimate the PC market grew roughly 25% year-over-year. Within that, we estimate consumer PCs grew almost 30%, while business PCs grew 14%. This quarter netbooks represented approximately 10% of the total PC market.
Let’s move on to this quarter’s performance by business group, beginning with Windows & Windows Live division, which had another exceptional quarter. We continued to see very strong consumer demand for Windows, with consumer license growth up 35%. We also saw a return in demand for business PCs with licenses up more than 15%, leading us to believe the business PC refresh cycle has begun.
OEM units increased 30% year-over-year and outpaced PC shipments. OEM revenue increased 29% for the second quarter in a row and also outpaced the PC market. As with prior quarters, we have included a slide that bridges the difference between the PC market growth and OEM revenue growth.
We experienced on 9 percentage point headwind, primarily caused by emerging markets outpacing mature markets and consumer outpacing business. Windows attach and inventory drove 8 percentage points of OEM revenue growth. Conditions from the prior quarter remained largely unchanged with inventory exiting the quarter at normal levels.
Windows 7 up sell and channel dynamics drove 5 percentage points of OEM revenue growth, reflecting adoption of Windows 7 on netbooks and adoption of premium versions of Windows 7 on business and consumer PCs. The commercial, retail and online portion of the Windows division grew 26%, primarily driven by retail sales of Windows 7.
Now let’s move to server and tools. We estimate server hardware shipments strengthened considerably with year-over-year growth in the high teens. The OEM and license-only revenue, which represents 30% of the business, grew high single digits, an improvement from prior quarters.
Within that, Windows Server revenue grew mid-teens, while SQL Server and developer tools experienced slower growth in front of new product launches. Annuity revenue, which is approximately 50% of the business was roughly flat. Enterprise services grew 5%.
Our virtualization solutions continue to be strong. system center server revenue grew over 20% and Windows Server Premium mix remains over 20% this year. Additionally, our share of new x86 virtualization licenses, which includes Hyper-V and Virtual Server, is now 25%, up 3 points year-over-year in the December quarter according to IDC.
We released to manufacturing Digital Studio 2010, announced a new partnership with Citrix that furthers our desktop virtualization offering and yesterday, we released to manufacturing SQL Server 2008 R2. Clearly there is very strong product pipeline in server and tools.
Now for the online services division, online advertising revenue grew 19%, primarily driven by search, which outperforms the market. We continue to be enthused with Bing’s momentum, which includes 10 consecutive months of share gains in the U.S. We ended the quarter with U.S. query share of 11.7%, according to comScore, 340 basis points higher than when we launched Bing last May.
The Yahoo search partnership implementation is underway and we’re working toward U.S. completion by the end of this calendar year and global completion by early calendar year 2012.
Moving on to the Microsoft business division. In general, the conditions from last quarter remain unchanged. Revenue was down 6% but when adjusted for the Office 2010 Technology Guarantee deferral of $305 million, revenue was up 1%. Within MBD business revenue was down 1%.
As we have discussed previously, the non-annuity component of business revenue has been pressured in advance of the next product cycle, while annuity revenue was roughly flat.
Consumer revenue, which includes the OEM and retail portions of this business, increased 11% when adjusting for the Technology Guarantee and was primarily due to strong PC shipments. Last Friday we released to manufacturing Office 2010 and SharePoint 2010. We expect commercial availability in May with general availability in June.
With respect to the $305 million Tech Guarantee deferral, it’s important to note that due to varying international availability and fulfillment dates, there will be puts and takes to the unearned revenue balance throughout Q4.
However, the Tech Guarantee deferral balance is expected to remain roughly unchanged at the end of Q4. We expect that substantially all of the Tech Guarantee unearned revenue balance will be recognized in the second quarter of fiscal year 2011.
During the quarter we made terrific progress in our cloud offering. Customers such as Starbucks, McDonald’s, GlaxoSmithKline, Coca-Cola Enterprises, Aviva and Swedish Red Cross are all going to the cloud with Microsoft.
We now have 40 million paid seats of our commercial online services. Clearly companies are choosing Microsoft for their cloud productivity solutions and we intend to build on this momentum.
Now let’s move on to the entertainment and devices division. Gaming revenue declined 4%, as we sold 1.5 million consoles, a unit decline of 12%, which was roughly in line with the overall market. While our software attach rate continued to lead the industry at $8.8, first party software revenue declined based on difficult comparisons to the prior year launch of Halo Wars. This was substantially offset by the continuing strong revenue and membership growth of Xbox LIVE.
Non-gaming revenue was up 14%, reflecting growth in the PC hardware market and increased Windows embedded revenue. As Peter mentioned, we continued to have good momentum on the product side for mobile. During the quarter we announced Windows Phone 7 and last week we announced Kin, which will be available in the U.S. in May.
Now for the rest of the income statement. Cost of goods sold decreased 2% to $2.8 billion, driven primarily by lower Xbox 360 volume and console costs. These savings were partially offset by increased traffic acquisition and online costs. Operating expenses were $6.6 billion, as we continued to manage our expenses and prioritize our investment.
Headcount declined both year-over-year and sequentially. D&A expenses grew due to contractual costs associated with our Yahoo search partnership and legal expenses. We repurchased $2 billion worth of shares and paid $1.1 billion of dividends.
So to wrap up, the consumer segment continued to drive great results. In addition, we saw the beginning of the business PC refresh. This combined with our strong product pipeline and our continued focus on execution and cost management, means we’re well-positioned for the future.
With that, I’ll hand it back to Peter, who is going to discuss our business outlook.
Peter Klein
Thanks Bill. Now I’ll discuss our expectations for our fourth quarter and the next fiscal year. From a macro perspective, we expect the next quarter to be similar to the third quarter with continued strength in hardware shipments. We were encouraged by the recent uptick in business PC growth and expect that this business refresh cycle will continue over a couple of years.
Before I get into my commentary by division, remember that the June quarter is the close of our fiscal year. As such, it is historically a seasonal high for our enterprise sales and we’re entering it with a strong sales pipeline.
While we’ve noted early signs of improvement, the business spending environment and associated sales cycles remained challenging. We will be very focused on closing deals during the quarter and we expect that unearned revenue will likely return to normal seasonal patterns.
Beginning with the Windows division, we expect revenue to grow slightly faster than the overall PC market in the fourth quarter. Attach, inventory and premium mix gain should more than offset macro trends particularly that of the emerging markets growing faster than mature markets.
Turning to the Microsoft business division, we’re very excited about the launch of Office 2010 this June, as it will provide the best productivity experienced across the PC, phone and browser.
The combination of Office 2010, SharePoint 2010, Exchange 2010 and Office Communications Server will be the practical platform for IT, delivering anywhere access to your document and unmatched collaboration.
For the fourth quarter, consumer and business non-annuity revenue, approximately 40% of the total, should track towards PC shipment growth, while we expect annuity revenue to be up low single digits.
The server and tools business generally aligns with server hardware shipments and business IT spending. Similar to many observers, we expect server shipments to show healthy year-over-year growth. In the fourth quarter we expect that non-annuity revenue should move generally in line with hardware shipments. Annuity revenue should grow mid single digits, while enterprise services revenue should grow low single digits.
For the online services division, the outlook for online advertising appears to be improving and we expect the trends from the third quarter to continue. Excluding the impact of our legacy access business, revenue should be in line with or better than the market for the fourth quarter.
In the entertainment and devices division, we maintain our view expressed last earnings call that full year revenue should be roughly flat relative to the prior year. This translates into a fairly robust growth rate for the fourth quarter, driven by the uplift from the strong PC market, increased gaming attach revenue and momentum in Windows embedded.
Switching to costs, we continued to make good progress containing our cost of goods sold, despite the upward pressures of increased traffic acquisition costs in our search business and growth of our online services.
As a result of our operational initiatives, improved Xbox 360 console costs and a continuing favorable revenue mix, we now expect full year gross margin to expand 1%, compared to the prior year.
With regard to operating expenses, we remain focused on diligently managing our cost structure and aligning resources to key priority. For the full year, we’re lowering our operating expense guidance now expected to be between $26.1 billion and $26.3 billion.
We estimate that our capital spending for the year will be no more than $2 billion and our effective tax rate should be approximately 25% for both the quarter and the year. We will continue to generate strong free cash flow and will return capital to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases over the long run -- the amount of repurchases may vary from quarter-to-quarter.
Now I’d like to spend a few minutes looking ahead at fiscal year 2011, with more details to follow at our financial analyst meeting in July. From a macro perspective, we expect the business refresh cycle that I referenced earlier will continue through fiscal year 2011. This combined with strong momentum from Windows 7 and the launches of Office 2010, SharePoint 2010 and SQL Server 2008 R2, will be significant revenue drivers for our core businesses.
Switching to online, we expect the online advertising market to be better than fiscal year 2010. Our business should continue to grow faster than the market, excluding our legacy access business, which will be less of a headwind as it becomes a smaller portion of the mix. We expect our partnership with Yahoo will begin to contribute to our revenue the second half of that fiscal year.
Lastly, the entertainment and devices division will be introducing an unprecedented wave of innovation in the first half of the year, including (inaudible) and its launch title, as well as Halo Reach, (inaudible) and Windows Phone 7.
Now moving to cost of goods sold. It’s important to consider the shift of revenue mix across software, services and hardware. While there are a number of factors to weigh for next year, the single largest variable driving cost of goods sold will be hardware demand in the Xbox business. Additionally, we will continue to pursue operational efficiency, as we have throughout this year.
Switching to operating expenses, we’re currently working through our budgeting process and maintain our outlook of $27.0 billion to $27.5 billion. All of this will allow us to continue to generate exceptional operating cash flow, which we will continue to return to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.
So in summary, we delivered very good financial results for the quarter with strong demand for Windows 7 driving revenue growth and solid cost management enabling operating income and earnings per share to grow even faster. As we look forward, we’re encouraged by improving market conditions taking shape as we continue to launch our strongest wave of products in the company’s history.
With that, I’ll turn the call over to Bill and answer some of your questions.

Thanks Peter. We want to get to questions from as many of you as possible. So please stick to one question and avoid long or multipart questions. Barb, can you please go ahead and repeat your instructions?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And first is Heather Bellini with ISI.
Heather Bellini – ISI
Hi. Good afternoon, guys. I was wondering if you could talk about your comment about a return to normal seasonality in unearned revenue. I guess, what I’m wondering -- had the Tech Guarantee benefit Q3 deferred. So when we’re looking if normal seasonality were to happen in Q4, are we taking the Q3 ending balance and thinking about it that way or should we be thinking about adjustments for the Tech Guarantee? Thank you.
Bill Koefoed
Yeah. Take it as it is.
Heather Bellini – ISI
Great. Thank you very much.
Bill Koefoed
Thanks Heather.

Next is Walter Pritchard with Citigroup.
Walter Pritchard – Citigroup
Hi. Could you guys talk about on the server side, it looks like non-annuity revenue grew a little bit slower than server units and I guess, you’re seeing an uplift in version mix there, which should be helping the situation. Just curious to get some more detail on that as well as what you think we should see looking forward into June and beyond?
Peter Klein
Yeah. You have to break it down, I think, you have to break it down into its components. There’s actually two pieces of the non-annuity business of the transactional business, the Windows Server piece and then the other pieces of the business. The Windows Server non-annuity piece actually grew a mid-teens, so tracked towards the hardware market.
The other products, things like SQL Server and Visual Studio grew slower than that in anticipation of a product release [account]. So it tends to be less correlated particularly in quarters where there is a significant growth year-very-year. So that was the issue there.
In terms of looking forward, I think we gave the guidance on what we expect for the transactional business, particularly as we launch Visual Studio and SQL Server tracking more towards the server hardware market.
Walter Pritchard – Citigroup
Great. Thanks.
Peter Klein
Yeah.
Bill Koefoed
Barb, can you ask next question.
Operator
Next is Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley.
Adam Holt – Morgan Stanley
Terrific. Thank you. My question is about Office. As we near the release, I was hoping you could talk to us about how you’re thinking about what the impact should be, what you think about with respect to the average selling price opportunity on Office?
And in particular also, you mentioned transactional revenue for the next quarter. Should we assume that transactional revenue continues to accelerate as we get deeper into the Office cycle? Thanks.
Peter Klein
Yeah. Let me get your last question first. Certainly as we’ve said, we expect the largest part of the impact from the launch actually to happen in fiscal year ‘11. So typically what you’d see, since we’re launching it in the May, June timeframe, typically what you’d see is several quarters after that the impact of that. So you should see that in the first half of fiscal year ‘11.
It terms of average selling price, it’s a little hard to talk about that now. It’s going to be a function of obviously mix but I would just think about it the way the Office 2007 launches. The one thing I would add to that, where you will see it is in the platform side of the business. So when you see the Enterprise CAL and how we monetize the enterprise versions of the productivity infrastructure for SharePoint on Exchange is where you’ll see opportunities for overall revenue growth from an ASP perspective, for an (inaudible).
Adam Holt – Morgan Stanley
Terrific. Thank you.
Peter Klein
Thanks Adam.

And next question is from Sarah Friar with Goldman Sachs.
Sarah Friar – Goldman Sachs
Great. Thanks for taking my question. Peter, on the cost side, I mean, you highlighted this great expansion that you’ve seen as you’ve -- you’re starting to read the benefits of those cost controls that you took a few about a year ago.
As you look out to Q4, your guidance would suggest actually a sequential decline in the operating margin and yet you should be hitting, pretty strong product cycles still on Windows and Office beginning to come into the mix. Why wouldn’t we get more margin expansion in Q4?
And then as you look at fiscal ‘11 costs, what are the puts and takes of why costs go up versus what other measures you can do to keep them down?
Peter Klein
Yeah. The biggest thing driving the Q4 expenses is revenue driven expenses that are associated with primarily our enterprise annuity business, which are going to be up, fair amount both sequentially and year-over-year and so that’s the biggest thing you’ll see in Q4.
The other thing you’ll see in Q4 is, as I talked about, the wave of product launches that we’ve got coming, including Office 2010 and SQL Server. So it’s just, what’s happening this quarter is sort of, not unique but those are the things that are really driving what you’re seeing in Q4.
And of course, those have been embedded in our guidance all year long and the fact of the matter is we’ve been -- we try to manage our costs in such way as possible and bring it down whenever we can, which we did this quarter.
The dynamics in FY ‘11, as you note there’s a lot of puts and takes and we’re always prioritizing and aligning our investments. But all up, you should think the things that are driving it are similar. There’s some revenue driven as we continue to grow revenue and there’s also some sales and marketing associated with some key launches that we will have, particularly in the first half of the year related to the consumer businesses like Natal and phone. And I would say, keep in mind that is a pretty measured increase of only 3% to 5% for the full year.
Sarah Friar – Goldman Sachs
Okay. Great. Thanks for the color.
Peter Klein
Yeah. Thanks Sarah. Barb?
Operator
And next is Brent Thill with UBS.
Brent Thill – UBS
Thanks. Peter, considering the strength of the product cycle and the uptick we’re seeing in corporate spend. It’s still surprising to hear about lengthening sales cycles and I think the unearned was below the Street estimates.
What are customers citing the reasons why they are not pre-signing up? Are they just waiting for all these products to be launched before they’re renewing or are they trying to get our hands around what you’re hearing from the customer base.
Peter Klein
Yeah. There’s a couple of things. One that is true, particularly when there is so many products that are launching. So there’s a bunch of revenue that’s going to come through on the non-annuity side that people are waiting for launches for. And I do think that hardware, if you think about what’s happened over the last year. The first thing that got hit and decreased earliest and fastest was hardware and that’s what’s coming back first.
And I think that over time, as we’ve been saying and I think most other people are saying, over the course of calendar 2010 and certainly into 2011, you’ll start to see the growth in the overall IT spend.
For us in particular, from a sales cycle perspective, Q4 is just seasonally our biggest quarter. And so when you combine sort of the sales cycle and the product cycle, kind of converging on Q4 and beyond, as well as where we’re I think in the stage of what businesses are doing in terms of first refreshing their hardware that kind of converges over the next two or three quarters probably.
Brent Thill – UBS
Thanks.
Bill Koefoed
Next question, please.
Operator
Next is John DiFucci with JP Morgan.
John DiFucci – JP Morgan
Thank you. Peter, I have a question on the Windows business. It looks like on slide 11 you’ve got about 8% benefit from the Windows attach and inventory. And I’m assuming that’s from less piracy and then inventory build in the channel.
You also got about, I think it was 10% last quarter. Now this is the second quarter into a new launch of Windows 7. I’m just curious, I mean, how sustainable is that? I would assume that piracy is going to be less during a launch even pirates have to buy legitimate copies at least for a while.
And then also the inventory build in the OEM channel, I assume that would start to wane. If that happens, would you expect that benefit to start to wane here and if it does, should we be thinking that the segment mix line up above that with a corporate refresh cycle that sounds like it’s going to happen in the second half, that should start, you’d start to see less of a negative hit in that line or how should we be thinking about this?
Peter Klein
Well, it’s a great question. You’re thinking about all of the right components of it and certainly, attach and piracy are always going to sort of cycle up and down depending on where you are. We’re working through this year sort of a work-down of the inventory from last year and we’re still working that. We’re at sort of normal inventory levels.
That’s been a good year-over-year thing for us and attach, correct, is -- part of that is piracy related to the launch of Windows 7. All those things so we’ve given you specific color for Q4, what to expect for the OEM business relative to the PC business.
Bill Koefoed
Sorry. Can I just add one thing?
Peter Klein
Yeah.
Bill Koefoed
The other thing is just there is an overall, I think we talked about it on prior calls, an overall secular change, which is the multinational OEMs are becoming a more significant portion of the total PC market. And that’s says good things for our attach relative to the prior mix of our revenue -- from different PC manufacturers, and...
John DiFucci – JP Morgan
So, and I’m sorry, just to, does that mean that you’re seeing a little less piracy and you expect to see that in some international markets?
Peter Klein
We’re seeing that globally.
John DiFucci – JP Morgan
Okay. Great. Thanks.
Peter Klein
Thanks John.

Next is Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.
Phil Winslow – Credit Suisse
Hi, guys. Good quarter. Peter, you guys have talked about in the last few quarters seeing a pretty significant uplift in Windows revenue from the retail channel, some consumers going out to the store to upgrade to Windows 7.
When you compare what you believe is sort of the corporate upgrade opportunity to be to what you’ve seen over the past couple of quarters to consumer, which one is the larger of the two? And when would you expect to see the corporate side begin? Thanks.
Peter Klein
Well, just in sheer numbers in terms of PC shipments, the consumer is a lot bigger than the business segment. Now, the impact you get from the business segment obviously is some ASP uplift.
We’re starting to and you get the corporate refresh in two ways. You can get sort of volume licensing upgrades or you can get it OEM when they buy the PCs, which is the largest piece of the revenue.
And that’s what we started to see happen and you saw some of that impact this quarter with business PC shipments up 14%. That’s the sort of this is sort of the shape of the opportunity going forward as that continues and you can see that has an uplift on our OEM revenue relative to the overall PC market.
Bill Koefoed
Next question, Barb.
Operator
Next is Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.
Kash Rangan – Merrill Lynch
Hi. Thank you very much. I just wanted you to talk a little bit more about the deferred revenue trajectory going into Q4. It looks like, this year compared to the start of the year deferred revenue long-term or short-term is down a lot more than what it has been the past few fiscal years, so that would argue for a bigger than seasonal catch-up in Q4.
So maybe you could talk about what is embedded in your expectations and what do you expect on the ELA side. And also, I think you’ve talked about book but not build portion of your bookings. So if you can just give us some color on how that is shaping up that would be great? Thanks.
Peter Klein
Yeah. Just in terms of the numbers, what we sort of the guidance that we said. It’s we’re looking for sequential increase in Q4 in a similar range that you’ve seen over the last three, four, five years sequential growth.
We’re starting to rebuild the balance. You started to see that happen a little bit in Q3 with our multiyear annuity billing having positive growth. So I think that’s sort of the essence of what we’re expecting and what we’re guiding to. What was your second question?
Kash Rangan – Merrill Lynch
The book but not build portion on the balance, you would talk about that in your presentations in prior times, but just noted that we’ve not been talking about that in recent times, just wondering if you have an update there?
Peter Klein
You know, I think, that’s actually a good thing that we’ll talk about in July on the Q4 call, just because it’s such a bigger issue, the seasonality in terms of our bookings in Q4 is so much more material than in Q3. I think that’s when we will talk about that.

Barb, next question.
Operator
Next is Brad Reback with Oppenheimer.
Brad Reback – Oppenheimer
Hey, guys. How are you?
Peter Klein
Good. How are you?
Brad Reback – Oppenheimer
Good. So Peter, just switching gears back to server and tools, as I look back at my notes from last quarter, I think you guys talked about the annuity business being up mid single digits and I think it came in flat this quarter.
Given my understanding that most of that is coming off the balance sheet, what would have caused that delta in that three months period?
Peter Klein
Yeah. I think, the comment was for H2 not for Q3 up mid single digits. And so if you look at our guidance again with the seasonality of our sales cycle most of that comes from Q4, which was in our guidance that we gave today.
Brad Reback – Oppenheimer
Okay. Great. Thanks.
Peter Klein
Thanks Brad.
Bill Koefoed
Thanks. Barb, next question.

And next is Katherine Egbert with Jefferies & Company.
Katherine Egbert – Jefferies & Company
Hi. Thanks. Speaking of guidance, there’s a lot of moving parts right now, multiple product cycles, revenue deferrals and economic recovery. What are you looking for to become comfortable with providing more specific guidance? What are the triggers?
Peter Klein
Well, I’m not sure there are specific triggers. I actually having a driver framework and having a really good qualitative discussion about all the factors that drive it, is actually a great way to talk about the outlook and the environment what we’re seeing for our businesses. And so, I think, there’s no specific triggers that are going to change that. I think the dialogue that we’re having around these drivers and the framework is great.
Bill Koefoed
Operator, next question.
Katherine Egbert – Jefferies & Company
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
And next is Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities.
Brendan Barnicle – Pacific Crest Securities
Thanks Peter. You talked about next year gross margins obviously having an impact from the hardware cycle. In the past at times you’ve talked about as you change to more cloud computing that taking a hit as well. Can you give us any range and could we see as much as 2 percentage points in change there next year?
Peter Klein
You know, we’re not giving a range on that now. We’ll definitely talk about that at the financial analyst meeting in July.
Bill Koefoed
Operator, next question.
Operator
And next is Rob Breza with RBC Capital Markets.
Rob Breza – RBC Capital Markets
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Peter, just maybe as a follow-up to Brendan’s question, you called out in your prepared remarks the 40 million paid seats for the cloud initiative. I was wondering if you could talk about where you’re seeing the strength there and how we might expect that to be 12 months from now? Thanks.
Peter Klein
Yeah. We’re seeing strength across a variety of our areas. You heard Bill talk about all the great customers we have our commercial online services like SharePoint and Online and Exchange Online. That’s obviously a big growth area for us. The 40 million comes from things like Live Meeting and Exchange Hosted Services and CRM Online.
And so what you’re seeing is really part of our strategy. So the broadest array of commercial services for businesses of all sizes. Some of these are really aimed more at mid-market customers. Some are aimed more at big enterprise customers and we’re getting growth from both.
And then the last thing that we sort of touched on but didn’t talk about in great detail was Azure, which is now available in 41 countries and what that will do really over the next couple of years.
Bill Koefoed
Barb, we’ve got time for just one more question.
Operator
Okay. The last question comes from Tim Klasell with Thomas Weisel Partners.
Tim Klasell – Thomas Weisel Partners
Yeah. Good afternoon, everybody. A question about the Windows 7 upgrade cycle, it appears to us that a lot of customers are going to attach a Windows 7 upgrade with maybe a Server 2008 R2 upgrade.
Are you sensing that and could that maybe delay the Windows 7 upgrade cycle a little bit more than we normally would but have the positive impact of pulling along some server sales as well?
Peter Klein
You know, we really haven’t seen that at all, as a matter of fact when we talk to our enterprise customers, there’s a high degree of intent to deploy Windows 7 as soon as possible.
There’s a, many, many, high percentage our customers are already either in pilot or pre-launch mode for deploying Windows 7. So, I think, we haven’t seen that as a phenomenon at all, people waiting for Windows 7. In fact we see the opposite that people are deploying it rather quickly.
Tim Klasell – Thomas Weisel Partners
Okay. Great. Thank you.
Peter Klein
Thanks. Okay. So that will wrap up our Q&A portion of today’s earnings call. Remember that you can access this call on the Microsoft Investor Relations website at microsoft.com/msft.
Please keep in mind that we will be in a number of conferences in the next couple of months. We’ll be at the JP Morgan Conference in May, the Banc of America/Merrill Lynch Conference, the Cowen Conference, the RBC and UBS Conferences in June. In addition, we will be previewing Natal at E3 in LA in June. Please contact Microsoft Investor Relations if you need additional details. We hope to see you there.

Welcome to the Microsoft second quarter fiscal year 2010 conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Koefoed, General Manager, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. 
Bill Koefoed
Thank you, and thanks everyone for joining us this afternoon. Let me begin by welcoming Peter Klein to his first earnings call as Microsoft’s Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us today are Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel. 
Today Peter will start with takeaways from the second quarter of our 2010 fiscal year. Then I will get into the details of the quarter before handing it back to Peter, who will discuss our business outlook. After that, we will take your questions. 
We filed our Form 10-Q this afternoon. In addition we posted our quarterly financial summary slide deck, which is intended to follow the flow of our prepared remarks, as well as provide a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. You can find these documents at the Investor Relations website at Microsoft.com/MSFT. 
Today’s call will be webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, any future use of the recording and in the transcript which will be posted on our website. You can replay the call and view the transcript at the Microsoft investor relations website until January 28, 2011. This conference call is protected by copyright law and international treaties. Unauthorized reproduction or distribution of this call or any portion of it without the express written permission of Microsoft may result in civil and criminal penalties. 
We will be making statements during this call that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in today’s earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the risk factor section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. 
Okay, Peter, it is all yours. 
Peter Klein 

Thanks Bill. Good afternoon, everyone. It is a pleasure to be joining you for my first earnings call. I have met with many of you over the last two months and during my prior roles at Microsoft and I look forward to spending time with many more of you in the months ahead. 
Over the course of my career both inside and outside of Microsoft, in good economies and bad, I have learned that there are a few constants that persistently translate to success; working with great people and relentlessly focusing in creative value for customers, employees and shareholders. I am delighted to have the opportunity to do that in my new role, building on our current momentum and driving future growth. 
Now let me share some thoughts on our second quarter results. We reported record revenue and record profits. These results were driven in large part by strong consumer demand for Windows 7 and PCs. While consumer demand remains healthy, we have not seen a return of enterprise spending growth. Meanwhile our ongoing work in managing expenses and aligning our cost structure to the highest priorities has enabled us to drive earnings growth ahead of revenue growth. 
We also returned $4.8 billion of cash to investors through dividends and stock repurchases. As we have previously discussed, we are just starting our strongest product cycle ever. This quarter was highlighted by the successful launches of Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2 and Exchange 2010. We released Office 2010 to beta and introduced more Bing innovations this quarter. Bing has now gained market share each month since its launch. 
We also announced upcoming releases of two very important and compelling offerings that will drive growth into the future, Windows Azure and Natal. Azure is our cloud platform which is providing developers, partners and our customers a smooth transition to the cloud with tools and processes they already know. Natal, which is based on our natural user interface work, will energize this generation’s gaming and entertainment experience starting this coming holiday season. 
So in summary, I am very pleased with our progress this quarter. We have momentum with products and markets. We have an exciting pipeline of new products and we delivered strong financial results.
I will now hand the call back to Bill to give you some additional details on the quarter and then come back and provide some thoughts on our outlook. 
Bill Koefoed 

Thanks, Peter. I will start with the company overview and then go through revenue performance for each of our business units. I will then review the rest of the income statement. Please keep in mind that all growth comparisons relate to the corresponding quarter of last year unless I specify otherwise. 
As Peter mentioned, we had an exceptional quarter with record revenue and profit. Overall revenue grew 14% to just over $19 billion, primarily driven by strong Windows 7 consumer demand. Net income and earnings per share were $6.7 billion and $0.74 respectively. Excluding the $1.7 billion of revenue recognized from the Windows 7 upgrade program and Windows 7 licenses sold in advance of general availability, revenue grew 4%. Foreign exchange did not have a significant impact on revenue during the quarter. 
Our product billing mix in the second quarter was roughly the same as last year with 30% annuity, 30% OEM and 25% license only with the balance coming from our other businesses. 
Now let me dive deeper into the overall revenue mix. Geographically emerging markets grew mid teens while mature markets grew single digits. In terms of segments, consumer demand continued to be the driver of growth. While we saw stabilization in the business segment, as Peter mentioned, we have not seen a return of enterprise spending growth to date. Enterprise agreement sales cycles have lengthened and multi-year annuity revenue was flat year-over-year. 
Unearned revenue was $12.5 billion, down slightly from last year. On a sequential basis, unearned revenue was down primarily due to this quarter’s recognition of the $1.7 billion of Windows 7 revenue that I referred to earlier. Our contracted not billed balance was approximately $13 billion, down slightly from last year. 
Now for the PC market. PC hardware shipments grew substantially during the quarter fueled by demand for Windows 7 and innovation from our OEM partners. The combination of Windows 7 and the unprecedented variety of hardware choices, form factors and price points makes it a terrific time for customers to get exactly the PC they want. Year-over-year, we estimate that PC market grew 15 to17%. More specifically we estimate consumer PCs grew more than 20% while business PCs were roughly flat. This quarter netbooks represented about 11% of the total PC market, roughly flat compared with last year and last quarter. 
Now with that backdrop, let’s move onto revenue and business drivers by segment, beginning with the Windows and Windows Live division which I will refer to as the Windows Division. All of my comments related to the Windows Division are adjusted to exclude the $1.7 billion of Windows 7 revenue I referred to earlier. Keep in mind this is a non-GAAP view and all GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in our slide deck which is posted on our website. 
Overall, the Windows Division had a phenomenal quarter with record quarterly revenue of $5.2 billion, growing 28% year-over-year. This growth was mainly driven by increased OEM unit sales of 22%. OEM revenue increased 21% and grew faster than PC shipments for the first time in eight quarters. As in the prior quarter, we have included a slide that bridges the difference between the PC market growth and OEM revenue growth. Changes in segment mix represented a nine percentage point headwind to OEM revenue. This was caused by two factors; a higher mix of consumer PCs than business PCs and emerging markets outpacing mature markets. 
Windows attach and inventory drove 10 percentage points of OEM revenue growth. Attach accounted for about half the increase. Year-to-date, we saw solid attach gains across all regions, channels and form factors. Inventory accounting for the other half of the increase was a result of OEMs rebuilding inventory to exit the quarter at normal levels as we discussed in last quarter’s call. 
Windows 7 up sell and channel dynamics drove six percentage points of OEM revenue growth reflecting consumer demand for Windows 7 Home Premium and demand for Windows 7 on netbooks. The commercial, retail and online portion of the Windows Division grew 55% primarily driven by the retail launch sale of Windows 7. 
Now let me give you some additional Windows data points. Through the end of the second quarter, we sold more than 60 million Windows 7 licenses, making it the fastest selling operating system in history. Windows is attached to more than 90% of netbooks with Windows 7 accounting for well over half of that. Windows consumer licenses grew more than 35% year-over-year. Finally, Q2 was another record quarter, representing the highest number of Windows licenses sold in one quarter ever. In fact, Q2 beat the previous record set last quarter by 20%. 
In summary, it was an exceptional quarter for the Windows Division. With Windows 7, we have terrific consumer momentum and a great product for the business PC market when it recovers. 
Now let’s move to server and tools. The server hardware market was stronger than expected for the quarter although still down slightly year-over-year. Our OEM and license only revenues continued to outperform underlying X86 server hardware market shipments while annuity revenue grew low single digits. This quarter we released Windows Server 2008 R2. Customer adoptions of this and our virtualization and management offerings continue to build momentum. Revenue from our virtualization offerings such as Premium editions of Windows Server and Systems Center grew double digits. 
At PDC, we provided an update on Windows Azure, including the anticipated commercial availability next month. In addition, we recently announced a three-year agreement with Hewlett-Packard. This partnership offers customers comprehensive solutions whether for data centers or public clouds. We are also very excited about the upcoming May release of Sequel Server 2008 R2 which will further expand our capabilities in business intelligence and data warehousing. 
Now for the Online Services Division. While search revenue grew, display revenue was hampered primarily by international rate declines. We continue to be pleased with Bing’s momentum to date including seven consecutive months of share gains in the US. Regarding our Yahoo! Partnership, we are still working through the regulatory review process and continue to be hopeful the deal will be approved early this year. 
Now onto the Microsoft Business Division. In general, the conditions from last quarter remain unchanged. Revenue was down 3% as enterprise spending remained soft. Business revenue was down 6% due to weak business PC sales. The non-annuity component of business revenue was pressured in advance of the next product cycle. Annuity revenue was roughly flat as expected. 
Consumer revenue which includes the OEM and retail portion of this business increased 12%. This growth was primarily due to better than expected consumer PC shipments although it still lags the overall PC market. Within MBD, we continue to see double digit growth of our SharePoint, Office Communication Server and Dynamic CRM products. During the quarter we released a beta of Office 2010 which has been downloaded over 2 million times. 
In the Entertainment and Devices Division revenue was down 11%. During the quarter, we sold 5.2 million consoles, a year-over-year decline of 13%. Due to the favorable mix shift to Elite and Special Edition consoles, console ASPs were down only slightly following the Q1 price cuts. While our software attach rate continued to grow and lead the industry at 8.8, attach revenue declined as we faced difficult comps with the prior year. 
Xbox Live continued to contribute to the quarter’s performance and now has 23 million members, over 35% growth from a year ago. We also continue to make progress in the mobile space and you will hear more about that at Mobile World Congress in February. 
Now for the rest of the income statement. Cost of goods sold decreased 7% to $3.6 billion driven primarily by lower Xbox 360 volume and console costs. These savings were partially offset by increased traffic acquisition and online costs. Operating expenses increased 1% to $6.9 billion and included approximately $290 million of legal expenses. We continue to execute on our resource management plan and during the quarter eliminated an additional 800 positions. Year-over-year headcount declined 8%. 
This quarter cash flow from operations was $5 billion and we repurchased $3.6 billion of shares and paid $1.2 billion of dividends. 
So to wrap up, while we have yet to see a return of business spending growth, the consumer segment performed better than expected and we couldn’t be more pleased with the reception of Windows 7 by our partners, developers and most importantly our customers. We continue to be excited by our momentum and believe we are well positioned for the future. 
With that I will hand it back to Peter who is going to discuss our business outlook. 
Peter Klein 

Thanks, Bill. Now I will discuss our expectations for calendar 2010. From a macro perspective, IT spending should improve from the recessionary levels of 2009. Taking into account second quarter results, we are incrementally positive towards the PC and server hardware markets. As we have been saying, we expect the business hardware refresh cycle to begin this calendar year occurring gradually over a couple of years. 
When thinking about the remainder of fiscal 2010, keep in mind that our third quarter tends to be seasonally weaker than our second and fourth quarters. 
Now addressing each of the divisions individually. In the third quarter, we expect Windows Division revenues to be roughly in line with the overall PC market growth. Attach gains and inventory rebuild relative to the prior year should offset macro trends of consumer PCs growing faster than business PCs and emerging markets growing faster than mature markets. When thinking of sequential trends in the third quarter, keep in mind Q2 included a large retail launch impact. For the full year, we expect Windows Division revenue to grow in line with the overall PC market growth. 
The Microsoft Business Divisions revenue in the third quarter should largely demonstrate the same dynamics as in the first half. Consumer and business non-annuity revenue, approximately 40% of the total, will face ongoing pressure in advance of the next product cycle, and as such should lag overall PC shipments until Office 2010 becomes generally available in June. We expect annuity revenue, representing 60% of total revenue, to be broadly flat for the full year. 
The release of the Office 2010 beta this quarter was an important milestone. We have received terrific feedback from early adopters about the flexibility and powerful new ways to stay productive across the PC, browser and phone. As you think of the fourth quarter financial impact of the Office 2010 release, keep in mind the timing of the launch is late in the quarter and the financial impact should be seen starting in FY11. 
The server and tools business is most closely aligned to server hardware shipments and business IT spending. We expect server shipments to show year-over-year growth in Q3 and Q4 for the first time in several quarters. We expect non-annuity revenue which is approximately 30% of the total to move generally in line. Annuity revenue should grow mid single digits while services should be roughly flat for the year. 
For the Online Services Division, the outlook for online advertising appears to be improving. Excluding the impact of our legacy access business, we expect revenue to be roughly in line with the market for the third quarter and full year. 
In the Entertainment and Devices Division, revenue should directly track with the overall gaming market and we maintain our view that full-year revenue should be roughly flat. 
The past two quarters, we have made good progress containing our cost of goods sold, despite the upward pressure of increased traffic acquisition costs in our search business and growth of our online services. As a result of our operational initiatives, improved Xbox 360 console costs and an increasingly favorable revenue mix towards Windows, we now expect cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue to be roughly flat for this fiscal year. 
With regard to operating expenses, we remain focused on diligently managing our cost structure and aligning resources. For the full year, we reconfirm our guidance of $26.2 billion to $26.5 billion. This takes into account our second quarter performance, the impact of one-time costs, including the Yahoo! partnership integration expenses and higher revenue driven selling expenses. We also reconfirm that our capital spending for the year will be more no than $2 billion and our effective tax rate should be approximately 25%. 
We continue to generate strong free cash flow and will return capital to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases over the long run. 
In summary, we delivered very good financial results and are well positioned for future growth. We have great momentum in the market with Windows 7 and the upcoming launches of Office 2010 and Natal. Heading into 2010, we are encouraged by the possibility of improving market conditions converging with the strongest wave of products in our company’s history. Although the timing is uncertain, we are well positioned to capitalize on the business spending recovery when it occurs. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Bill and answer some of your questions. 
Bill Koefoed 

Thanks, Peter. We want to get to questions from as many of you as possible, so please stick to one question and avoid long or multi-part questions. Barb, can you please go ahead and repeat your instructions? 

Question and Answer Session 
Operator

(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Adam Holt - Morgan Stanley. 
Adam Holt - Morgan Stanley
My question is around average selling prices. If you look at the average selling prices in the quarter, they improved sequentially and obviously you are seeing both mix help that on the consumer side. But as we get a little bit deeper into the corporate upgrade cycle you are going to see a lot higher dollar value. How should we be thinking about average selling prices? Should we see steady sequential improvement there or some of the puts and takes around where you are seeing growth in the PC market going to offset that?

Peter Klein 

Obviously, the biggest driver of the ASPs will be the business PC refresh and the growth in that. The timing of that remains uncertain. We maintain our general view which we have had, that that will start to occur this year and occur gradually over the next couple of years. As that does, that obviously has an impact on our average selling price. 
What we saw this quarter on the consumer side was the great adoption of Home Premium as well as Windows 7 on netbooks which is driving that up sell that Bill talked about. Those two things combined will be the driver and it really depends on the macro. 
Adam Holt - Morgan Stanley
Do you think you saw a one-time spike there or do you think that premium mix can remain at that high level? 
Peter Klein 

We think, as we said in the guidance, revenue is going to be in line with PCs. There are some headwinds from emerging markets and consumers. So we will have to offset that with the ASPs and attach.

The next question comes from the line of Sara Friar - Goldman Sachs. 
Sara Friar - Goldman Sachs
Can I ask a question on the cost side? There still seems to be some debate on the Street as to how tight a reign you will keep on costs even though you have done a phenomenal job thus far. So I know you aren’t guiding for fiscal 2011 on this call but could you maybe just philosophically talk a little bit about the growth rate? I think you have messaged a low single digit inflation type rate, and then on the COGS side flat for next year is a great outcome. For next year with Azure and so on kicks in I am assuming we should assume the gross margin continues to come down. 
Peter Klein 

Obviously, it is too early to talk about FY11. We are working through that planning process right now and as soon as we get through that I will certainly get out and talk to everybody about that. Let me hit the operating costs. We are executing against our plan very effectively. I have been focused on even before taking this role working with Chris and the leadership team on that and feel great that we have a thoughtful plan that we have come up with and we are doing what we said and executing against that. 
A big part of that is prioritization and making sure the resources are allocated to the higher return areas. That will be the approach we take when we build our FY11 plan absolutely. So that approach stays the same. 
Sara Friar - Goldman Sachs
On the COGS side and the assumption that Azure will continue to drive that down? 
Peter Klein 

I think there are multiple dynamics on the COGS side. It is too early to get into that for FY11. There are puts and takes in online services, traffic acquisition costs, offset by improvements we make across the board, whether that is Xbox 360 consoles and some of our operations as well. So we have to get through the planning process on that.

The next question comes from the line of Brent Thill - UBS. 
Brent Thill - UBS
On the enterprise agreements, I think you mentioned the sales cycle has lengthened and you are flat year-over-year. Can you elaborate in terms of what you expect for the second half of the fiscal year on enterprise agreements? I would think considering the robustness of the product cycle that that would start to trend back up. 
Peter Klein 

Yes, that is the hope. Certainly on the enterprise agreement renewals, it is starting to take longer. We are getting them done. The sales cycle is elongating. The good news is we are getting them done. Maybe not in the quarter that they expire, but when we get them done we are not dropping products off of them, and in most cases we are actually adding new products onto the EA. So we feel great about the trajectory there. I tend to agree with you as the enterprise spend does pick up given our product pipeline we feel very well positioned from an enterprise agreement perspective. 
Operator

The next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini - ISI Group. 
Heather Bellini - ISI Group

I was wondering if you could help us think about the trends in deferred revenue? Obviously that is going to be a big driver of your fiscal 2011 growth. In particular, last year was obviously a challenging year for enterprise spending and you are saying that enterprise spending isn’t coming back, so would it be fair for us to think about your sequential deferred trends for the remainder of fiscal 2010 being more in line with what you had in the back half of your fiscal year 2009 just so we can help shape our models for the upcoming season? 
Peter Klein 

Well, it is hard to say. A lot of that is going to depend on the shape of enterprise spend and business spend. Obviously, we are…
Heather Bellini - ISI Group
Based on how you think spend is going to come out, based on your views about enterprise spending not coming back any time soon. 
Peter Klein 

The thing I can say is we have a great product pipeline. We don’t have visibility into exactly what business spend is going to be, so we are just going to have to work through that over the next couple of quarters. The only thing we can control as we have been saying is the products. We feel like we are executing against those and we will keep working the enterprise agreements as we can. 
Heather Bellini - ISI Group
So would that mean it would be unreasonable to assume…I mean last year I would imagine was a difficult closing environment as well so is a measure of conservatism with kind of seasonal growth rates like you had last year in deferred be prudent in your view versus expecting an uptick? 
Peter Klein 

I would just encourage anybody to think their view, there is different views of what enterprise spending is going to be. You will just have apply your view of that. 
Bill Koefoed 

I don’t think we are going to give guidance on that. 
Operator

The next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch. 
Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch
Just wondering, there has been a lot written about how you can deploy Windows 7 on the consumer side or the business side with existing hardware without trying to upgrade. I am curious on the consumer side and the business side what are you hearing? Can you give us some anecdotal data on revenue that you are seeing from so called shrink wrap purchases on the consumer side and maybe on the business side as well? At the threshold [ph], you don’t need to buy a brand new PC but I guess you could deploy Windows 7 on the existing hardware. What are you seeing on the business and consumer markets in regard to that? 
Peter Klein 

Good question. On the consumer side, we had a very good retail quarter, about $500 million which is a little bit more than we expected. So that dynamic as you highlighted is exactly happening. People are going to retail and buying shrink wrapped Windows to put on their PCs. On the business side, anecdotally a lot of interest. Businesses are incredibly enthusiastic about deploying. So we will hope to see that flow through over the coming year. So in both cases, a lot of positive momentum as you indicated. 
Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch
I guess Steve Ballmer has to take his words back because he said 200 to 300 is the max we should expect, so you are off to a great start on the retail shrink wraps. Congrats. 
Operator

The next question comes from the line of Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities. 
Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities 
Following up on the consumer question. A year ago netbooks were a huge concern and year-over-year basis they didn’t really change as a percentage and maybe there were some pricing changes on Windows 7. Has the dilutive impact of netbooks stabilized or started to change in any way? 
Peter Klein 

Yes I would definitely say it has stabilized. The mix has stayed stable. Our attach is very high at over 90% and as Bill said over 50% of that is Windows 7. So what we are finding is people want Windows 7 on all devices and all form factors. That is really what has been driving the quarter and the success of Windows 7. We have worked closely with all of our OEM partners to deliver the broadest range of devices, PCs, notebooks, whatever you have, whether it is a netbook or a laptop or a notebook or a desktop, Windows 7 is on them. So that is very positive for us. 
Operator

The next question comes from the line of Brad Reback - Oppenheimer. 
Brad Reback - Oppenheimer 
A couple of weeks ago you announced a bit of a reorg in the E&D segment. Could you help us understand how some of those moves can help you close the gap in those businesses, especially on the mobile side and some of the devices going forward? 
Peter Klein 

They don’t change the strategy that we have in both of those businesses. You do need to separate mobile from the entertainment side or the Xbox side. The Xbox is in a very good position right now. We have a great installed base of engaged users. We have the Xbox Live asset. We have got Natal coming out. We are working through the profitability on the console costs. So a ton of momentum and a really exciting year coming up. On the mobile side our strategy remains the same. As we have been saying from a product perspective, we are working very hard on the next version of Windows Mobile. As Bill indicated, we will be talking more about that in Barcelona in a few weeks. I wouldn’t think of the organization changes as fundamentally changing the strategy. It just puts us in a better position to continue to execute against what we are doing. 
Operator

The next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse. 
Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse
On the operating expense side, if I back into the midpoint of your guidance, it basically implies a year-over-year increase in OpEx in the second half of about 10.9% give or take versus obviously the decline in the first half. Now I understand that we are starting to anniversary some of the headcount reductions but I just want to get a sense for what is driving that increase or what line items or initiatives? 
Peter Klein 

So the biggest ones are the ones I talked about. There are the Yahoo! integration expenses, which is a one-time, new expense that we didn’t have last year. And then given the increased revenues we will see over the recessionary levels that we saw last time, there are just some variable sales costs that go along with that. So those drive year-over-year increases and those are the two biggest things. Obviously, we have been aware of those, it has been included in our plan and our guidance that we have had for the last several quarters. 
Operator

The next question comes from the line of John Difucci - J.P. Morgan. 
John Difucci - J.P. Morgan
It looks like the OEM unit license growth on the OS is about 5 to 7% greater than the PC unit growth. With the launch of Vista, that delta was like 8 to10%. I am just curious because there were some decent reviews on Vista when it came out but there were some questions at that point and in the end it really looks like Windows 7 is going to be a much greater success for you. I am just curious if you think you can see some more I guess…I know there are a lot of things that affect that but inventory build in the launch of a new OS seems to have a big effect. Where the inventories are today, do you think you can see even more benefit in the following quarter? 
Peter Klein 
Inventories are at about normal levels. So we feel pretty good and all the checks we have done on sell through, inventories are at a normal level. In terms of the comparison to Vista, it is a different world now. We have some headwinds that we may not have had then in terms of the segment mix that Bill talked about in terms of consumer and emerging markets, which is really some headwind. So if you break that out granularly and you look at the attach and inventory gains of 10%, half of that being attach, that is a good result. As I mentioned before, for us to continue to grow in line with the PC market, given those headwinds of the segment mix, we are going to have to continue to do better on attach and inventory and some of the XO [ph] as well. 
Operator

The next question comes from the line of Sandeep Aggarwal - Collins Stewart. 
Sandeep Aggarwal - Collins Stewart
By when can we expect market share gain by also translating into revenue growth acceleration and any update on the timing of regulatory approval for the Microsoft-Yahoo! deal? 
Peter Klein 

No updates. We are still waiting for regulatory approval and we are still hopeful we will close that deal early this year. It is a long-term process. We are continuing to gain share. What we really need to do is get the Yahoo! deal done, get that integrated and start to get the benefits of scale. So this is something you would expect to see in 2011 and beyond. 
Operator

The next question comes from the line of Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank Securities. 
Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank Securities
Turning to the enterprise adoption cycle around Win 7, can you give us any sense in terms of what you are seeing when you are talking to corporate out there? I know you don’t want to pre-announce Service Pack 1 but any kind of visibility in terms of how you think the adoption cycle might play out over the course of this year would be useful. 
Peter Klein 

It is hard to say exactly how it will play out. I will tell you the activity and the conversation, there is nothing about waiting for service packs. Everybody is really super excited about Windows 7 right now, and so there is a ton of activity. How that will play out in the deployment cycles remains to be seen and people are working through that. I would say there is way more business activity now than in previous launches. 
Operator

The next question comes from the line of Katherine Egbert - Jefferies. 
Katherine Egbert - Jefferies
It looked like you bought back almost $4 billion in stock this quarter. Is that right? And then can you just tell us what your philosophy is going forward on repurchases and dividends? 
Peter Klein 

It was about 3.6. My philosophy over the long-term is going to be very consistent with what we have been doing. We had a target amount of appropriate cash we think we need to have and then the operating cash flow after capital and acquisitions will be over the long-term distributed back to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. So exactly same consistent philosophy we have had over the last several years. 
Operator

The next question comes from the line of Tim Klasell - Thomas Weisel Partners. 
Tim Klasell - Thomas Weisel Partners
The guidance on the entertainment and devices division is roughly flat. Could you walk us through some of the puts and takes particularly as we get into later stages of the product cycle and the macro of them [ph]? 
Peter Klein 

The puts and takes are you should think about sort of the whole generation of gaming. We have Natal coming out this year and so you should think of it beyond sort of the rest of this fiscal year. Then how we go up and down depends on the timing of software titles. We have industry leading attach but there is a big difference on timing when we have first party titles versus third party titles. So I would consider what we are doing, excellent growth, and then it sort of gets re-energized with Natal as we head to holiday next year. 
Tim Klasell - Thomas Weisel Partners
So maybe roughly flat for the calendar year or roughly flat for the fiscal year? 
Peter Klein 

That was the fiscal year. We haven’t talked about FY11 yet.

Welcome to the Microsoft first quarter 2010 fiscal year conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Koefoed, General Manager, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. 
Bill Koefoed

Thank you, Barb and thanks everyone for joining us this morning. As you know yesterday was a significant day at Microsoft with the launch of Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2. We hope that you were able to see and participate in some of the exciting launch activities held around the globe. 
As usual, here with me are Chris Liddell, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Corporate Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel. Today Chris will start with takeaways from the first quarter of our 2010 fiscal year. Then I will get into the details of the quarter before handing it back to Chris, who will discuss our business outlook. After that, we will take your questions. 

We filed our Form 10-Q this morning. In addition we posted our quarterly financial summary slide deck, which is intended to follow the flow of our prepared remarks as well as provide a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. You can find these documents at the Investor Relations website at Microsoft.com/MSFT.
Today’s call will be webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in both our live transmission, any future use of the recording, and in the transcript which will be posted on our website. You can replay the call and view the transcript at the Microsoft investor relations website until October 23, 2010. This call is protected by copyright law and international treaties. Unauthorized reproduction or distribution of this call or any portion of it without the express written permission of Microsoft may result in civil and criminal penalties. 

We will be making statements during this call that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in today’s earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the risk factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. 

I want to point out one last thing before I turn the call over to Chris. With the recent move of Windows Live we changed the name of Client Division to the Windows and Windows Live Division. During the call, we will refer to this business as the Windows Division. 
Okay, Chris, the call is yours.  
Christopher P. Liddell
Thanks, Bill and good morning, everyone. The results of the first quarter were strong, particularly on an adjusted earnings per share basis, primarily as a result of two main factors; consumer demand for our Windows and Xbox products combined with excellent cost controls. 
This result was achieved despite relative weakness in business spending which has yet to see a broad based recovery. Having said that, it is showing signs of stabilization at lower levels and while it is too early to tell, the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 may well have been the bottom of the economic reset. 
Looking at the broader picture, at our Financial Analyst Meeting in July I articulated our approach to what we described as the “new normal” around five major shareholder value strategies; maximizing cash flow, streamlining our cost structure, driving operational excellence, capturing market share and investing in innovation. I am very happy with our progress in each of those five strategies during the quarter. 
For example, operating cash flow was $6.1 billion in the quarter which is a terrific result given the economic conditions are still challenging. We resumed our share buyback program with $1.4 billion of shares repurchased in the quarter, retained our $0.13 per share dividend, and built on our net cash and investment balance to over $33 billion. 
During the quarter, we also continued to focus on our long-term cost structure. We realized a 10% decrease in operating expenses over the prior year due to a lower number of people employed, lower cost per person, lower vendor spend and lower marketing costs. Our headcount at the end of the quarter was 4% lower than the same time last year, the first time a reduction of that significance has been achieved in the company’s history. 
After the last three months we have continued to show great operational excellence with not only the successful launch of Windows 7 but also the Windows Server 2008 R2 global launch yesterday and the recent release to manufacturing of Exchange 2010. In market share, while it is very early days, we are very happy with the progress of our search engine, Bing, and other notable accomplishments during the quarter include the continued gains in Windows Server, Systems General Management Tools and Xbox Live. 
Despite the focus on costs, we have continued to invest in innovation and this year to name a few, we will release Windows Azure, SharePoint 2010, Sequel Server 2008 R2, Office 2010 and continue to deliver innovations in Bing. 
In summary, I am very happy with both the short-term quarterly financial results and our progress on the factors we believe will drive long-term success. 
With that, I will provide on our outlook after Bill gives you some additional details on the quarter. 
Bill Koefoed 

Thanks, Chris. I will start with a company overview and then go through revenue performance for each of our business units. All of my comments are adjusted for the $1.5 billion of revenue deferred this quarter from both the Windows 7 upgrade program and Window 7 licenses sold in advance of general availability.  Keep in mind that this is a non-GAAP view and all GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in our slide deck.  All gross comparisons relate to the corresponding quarter of last year unless I specify otherwise.  
Overall, revenue was down 4% because of continued weakness in global demand especially in the business segment.  This was a positive result considering the macroeconomic environment and as Chris noted earlier, we were pleased with the strength of consumer demand, particularly for our Windows and Xbox products.  Foreign exchange headwinds had a $233 million or about a two percentage impact in the first quarter.  
This quarter, our product billing mix was roughly 35% annuity, 30% OEM and 25% license only, with the balance coming from our other businesses.  Enterprise agreement renewals were in line with our expectations and our multi-year annuity revenue grew low single digits in line with our outlook last quarter.  In terms of geographic mix, revenue in the U.S., driven primarily by consumer demand, was relatively strong compared with other regions.  Unearned revenue again, adjusted for Windows 7, was down $13 billion, down slightly from last year.  Our contracted but not billed balance was over $13 billion in line with last year.  
Now let’s move on to our thoughts on the PC market.    PC hardware demand improved significantly.  On a sequential basis, we estimate the PC market was up mid-teens.  Year-over-year we estimate the market grew 0% to 2%.  We estimate consumer PCs grew mid single digits from last year primarily due to growth in netbooks.  This quarter, netbooks represented about 12% of the total PC market similar to the mix last quarter and represented significant growth over the prior year.  Business PCs declined high single digits year-over-year but were up sequentially.
Now with that back drop, let’s move on to the revenue and business drivers by segment beginning with the Windows division.  Overall, OEM unit sales increased 6% from last year, several points over the PC markets due to higher attach and some inventory build in advance of the Windows 7 launch. At our financial analyst meeting in July, Steve shared with you a slide that bridged the change in the PC market to OEM revenue growth.  We have included the first quarter bridge in our slide deck.
To start, OEM revenues decreased 6% from last year. Changes in segment mix represented a 7% decline in OEM revenue from the prior year.  This was due to the PC market dynamics I discussed earlier, including continued growth in netbooks and the overall higher mix of consumer PCs versus business PCs.  Windows attach and inventory represented a 4% increase.  Attach rates increased year-over-year due to strong attach gains on netbooks and a continued shift to multinational OEMs, which reduced piracy.
Other items represented a 3% decrease due to the shift towards multinational OEMs and the wind down of the Windows XP revenue deferral.  The commercial, retail and online portion of the Windows division was up 2%, primarily driven by presales of Windows 7.  
Now let me touch on sequential trends.  On a sequential basis, OEM units increased 19% or about three percentage points faster than the overall PC market.  OEM revenue meanwhile increased 20% sequentially, and as you can see exceeded OEM unit growth.
To put the quarter results in perspective, Q1 represented the highest number of Windows licenses sold in one quarter ever, and September was the highest single month of Windows unit sales ever.  In summary, it was a very solid quarter for the Windows division and with Windows 7, we have a great product for the recovering PC market.  
Now let’s move to server and tools.  In general, the conditions from the fourth quarter remain unchanged.  We had a strong attach with Windows Server, SQL Server and System Center.  As a result our license only and OEM business declined less than the 20% drop estimated for the underlying x86 server hardware market.  Annuity revenue was up single digits in line with the outlook we gave last quarter.  FX rate changes were a two percentage headwind to revenue.  
As I mentioned earlier, we launched Windows Server 2008 R2 to the market yesterday.  We believe the virtualization and management capabilities offered are currently the best value in the market place and we are excited by the enterprise enthusiasm for this product.  
Moving on to the online services division; online advertising revenue was down 3% but included a three point FX headwind. While we experienced continued growth in page views, display revenue was weighed down by industry-wide year-over-year declines in advertising rates. On a sequential basis, however, rates seemed to be stabilizing.
In the U.S., search revenue was up mid-single digits despite industry-wide monetization declines in the quarter. We continued to make search share gains with Bing with share in the U.S. up every month since the June release.
In July, we signed a commercial agreement with Yahoo! to further gain scale and momentum in the search business. We are working through the regulatory review process and continue to be hopeful the deal will be approved early in calendar 2010.
In addition, earlier this week we announced strategic partnerships with Facebook and Twitter. These partnerships demonstrate our continued search innovation, and specifically with social media and real time content.
Moving on, Microsoft business division revenue was down 11% due to declines in both business and consumer spending. FX rate changes were a 2 percentage point headwind to revenue. Business revenue was down 4%, reflecting weak business PC sales. Within that, annuity revenue was up low-single digits, in line with the outlook we provided last quarter, while license-only sales declined over 20%. Consumer revenue, which includes the OEM and retail portions of this business, declined 34%, driven by tough inventory comps over last year due to prior-year pricing promotions and lower attach from the continuing shift to lower-priced PCs I discussed in my Windows Division commentary.
Within MVCs, we continued to see double-digit growth in our SharePoint, Office Communication Server, and CRM products.
In the Entertainment and Devices division, while console revenue was impacted by price cuts and volume decline, overall gaming revenue was up almost $100.0 million. Halo 3 ODST was the number one selling console title in the U.S. last month, along with five other Xbox 360 games in the top ten.
With a worldwide install base of almost 34 million consoles, Xbox 360 continues to lead the industry with an 8.7 software title attach rate. Xbox Live also contributed strongly to the quarter's performance, with revenue growth in excess of 50%. We believe consumers will be excited by the richer multi-media enhancements and integration with social networks that we are delivering this fall.
Now for the rest of the income statement -- cost of revenue was flat at $2.8 billion, driven by increased search distribution and online costs, which were offset by lower Xbox 360 console costs and service and support costs. 
Operating expenses decreased 10% to $5.6 billion, driven by reductions in headcount, headcount-related expenses, and vendor costs. 
Diluted shares outstanding were about 9.0 billion, down 2% from the prior year. This quarter, we repurchased $1.4 billion worth of shares and paid $1.2 billion of dividends. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.52, an 8% increase from the prior year.
Cash flow from operations was $6.1 billion.
So to wrap up, while business spending and the macroeconomic environment remain challenging, the consumer segment performed better than expected and Windows 7 is off to a great start and we feel terrific about our execution this quarter.
With that, I will hand it back to Chris, who is going to discuss our business outlook.
Christopher P. Liddell
Thanks, Bill. The remainder of this call, I will discuss our expectations for the second quarter and the remainder of fiscal 2010, starting with our assumptions for the industry.
Overall, the corporate IT spending trends we discussed in July remain intact. In our conversations with CIOs, many remain cautious about existing budgets and spending through the end of this calendar year, however, we believe calendar 2010 has the potential for improvement. Given the industry backdrop, we are extremely well positioned due to the strongest product cycle in our company's history and also continue to believe that we will exit the economic reset a much stronger, more focused, and cost efficient company.
Turning to segment expectations, in the second quarter we expected the Windows Division revenue, excluding the impact of the Windows 7 upgrade program, to be in line with overall PC market growth. With the launch of Windows 7, we expect inventory to rebuild in the channel and an increase in retail sales. This should offset the three hardware trends we have seen in recent quarter, which are netbooks growing faster than non-netbook PCs, consumer PCs growing faster than business PCs, and emerging markets growing faster than developed markets.
In the second quarter, we expect to recognize virtually all of the $1.7 billion of Windows 7 upgrade revenue deferrals from the last two quarters.
For the balance of the fiscal year, we expect Windows division revenue to remain in line with or slightly ahead of the overall PC market growth with the main variable being the pace of business PC improvement.
We see the potential for a corporate PC refresh cycle beginning in calendar year 2010 although it could be gradual and occur over a couple of years. We also expect the Net Books mix to stabilize over the course of the year.
In the second quarter, we expect Microsoft’s business division dynamics and revenue trends to be to be largely the same as they were in the first quarter with growth lagging PC shipments due to the factors Bill mentioned in his commentary.
For the full year, the consumer and business non-annuity revenue, approximately 40% of the total, should face the same trends as in the second quarter, with increasing pressure in advance of the next product cycle and as such could continue to lag PC shipments. We continue to expect annuity revenue representing 50% of the total to be broadly flat for the full year.
Our last quarter NBD results should improve when we start to see business spending recover combined with the impact of Office 2010.
The Server and Tool business is most closely aligned to enterprise spend. We expect this server shipment trend to gradually start to improve towards the end of our fiscal year. We expect non annuity revenue, which is approximately 35% of the total, to move generally in line with server shipments for the quarter and the year and annuity revenue will be mid single digits while services should be flat for the year.
In the entertainment and devices division, although we realized upside from our first party gains in the first quarter, remember we did release two significant titles in the second quarter last year which should cause difficult year over year comparisons. We therefore expect C&D revenue to decline several points in the second quarter, but we expect the full year revenue to be roughly flat as price cuts taken in August are offset by tax revenue and a larger console install base.
Turning to cost of goods sold, driving cost down in our operations plus a more favorable revenue mix resulted in a better performance there and we now expect COGS as a percentage of revenue to increase one point this year compared to the two we discussed at last call.
With operating expenses, we also continue to make excellent progress. We’re lowering our guidance for the full year to a range of $26.2 billion to $26.5 billion, down from what we said in July. This decrease however also absorbs an additional $100 million to $200 million of Yahoo! integration costs should the deal pass regulatory review. We will continue to look for additional cost saving opportunities based on cost of goods sold and in operating expenses through the rest of the fiscal year.
We expect CapEx to be at most $2 billion for the year and the tax rate to be 25%.
In summary, I feel great about how we’re executing given the economic reset that we’ve been through. We’re driving excellent cash flow, product innovation, and continued cost discipline. More importantly, our strategies will position us to take advantage of a recovering economy, which we hope to begin in the next calendar year.
The ensuing revenue growth, combined with continuing cost discipline, will set us up for long term earnings per share growth and a significant return of shareholder value. 
With that, let me take your questions and I’ll hand it back to Bill.
Bill Koefoed
Thanks, Chris. We want to get to as many questions as possible from you, so please stick to one question and avoid long or multi-part questions. Operator, please go ahead and repeat your instructions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley.
Adam Holt – Morgan Stanley
Good morning and congratulations on the quarter. My question is about average selling prices for Windows. You actually saw premium mix increase sequentially. I was wondering where do you think premium mix can go as you get deeper into the Win7 cycle and when would you expect the average selling prices to actually be additive to the Windows revenue story?
Christopher P. Liddell
In terms of the premium mix, clearly that’s going to change with the SKU structure that we have in Windows 7, and I think we’ll start to see a better -- in terms of [inaudible], a better number going forward simply because we won’t have home basic in the developed markets. So we’re going to see a much better home premium mix. In terms of how that feeds through to the financials, which I think is the main point, we will start to see it improve better but in particular we will start to see it better when we get a better business PC mix and to date, we have been clearly seeing a headwind in that and hopefully next year as we start to see a business PC refresh cycle, we will start to see a better mix there. That average selling price, which in the last year has been probably a negative, I would expect it to turn neutral or even slightly positive as we go through the year.

The next question comes from the line of John DiFuca with J.P. Morgan. 
John DiFuca - J.P. Morgan 
It looks like you saw some benefit from channel inventory build this quarter, after three quarters of I think it was a net negative contribution in the last three. You mention you expect inventory to build in the channel I think going forward here. I am just curious, how much more is there before we start to get to what you might consider to be I guess “normal inventory” if there is such a thing? Do we have another quarter or another couple of quarters? Is this something that could be a net positive for the next few quarters? 
Christopher P. Liddell
I think it will be a net positive throughout the year simply because channel inventory build, and even if it just stays at that level it will be positive relative to our low levels throughout last year. So we don’t need to see any additional build from what we saw for it to be a year-over-year net benefit. I think it is going to be a benefit right through the year. Whether it continues to get even better again we will see and that is going to depend clearly on the demand that our OEMs see through the Christmas period. 
What we saw, and you are certainly right it was last year as the economy contracted people clearly reduced the amount of inventory hedged so we not only had lower demand we had lower inventory holdings. We saw that reverse in the first quarter but we have only got back to what I would describe as “normal levels.” We haven’t got an excess of inventory in the channel, although clearly dependant on demand so we have gotten back to a normal level. If we stick with that it will be a year-over-year benefit. If we get good sales and good sell through of Windows 7 based PCs, which we are expecting, we could see some additional channel build as well.

The next question comes from the line of Sara Friar with Goldman Sachs. 
Sara Friar - Goldman Sachs
To switch gears a little over to online services, you talked a little bit about the timing of the Yahoo! transaction and the expectation that the costs in the cost guidance you have given. Can you give us any color on what you are expecting on the top line for Yahoo! and then any other kind of one-off costs? I know that Steve had mentioned a few way back on the Yahoo! call. 
Christopher P. Liddell
Sure. The $100 million to $200 million I mentioned in my commentary is the cost and that includes all of what I have described as one-off costs; that is setup costs in anticipation of migrating over, so that would be the total and that will clearly depend on when we get regulatory review, assuming that we do and how quickly we can implement. So there is a range there. On the revenue side there will be virtually no revenue contribution this fiscal year so all of those costs will be like one-off, startup costs that we will incur this year in anticipation of revenue contribution in fiscal year 2011. 
Sara Friar - Goldman Sachs
Fiscal year 2011, I know you are not guiding for it but just to put some boundaries around it, what sort of size are you thinking about for Yahoo! right now? We see it as about a $360 million type contribution based on what they have been doing. 
Christopher P. Liddell
It will be hundreds of millions but it is not going to be more than that or less than that, but you are in the right order of magnitude. I can’t give you anything more specific than that on this call. 
Operator

The next question comes from the line of Brad Reback with Oppenheimer. 
Brad Reback - Oppenheimer 
On the last call on the COGS side of the equation, you talked about undertaking an internal program to focus on driving down costs. Obviously some of that is showing up here in the guidance going forward. Can you give us a sense of how far through you are with that program and if there are meaningful gains to be had from this point forward? 
Christopher P. Liddell
Certainly in the cost of goods sold area I see that really as a journey that never ends. So that is something that we are going to focus on year after year after year now and certainly in good manufacturing discipline, and a lot of it is manufacturing hardware COGS, that is the sort of approach you should take. Certainly we have embarked on a project which has made some significant difference in the short-term and you are right we are starting to see some benefit of that feeding through this fiscal year. I am really happy with the progress we have made but that is not going to be a one-off where we just do it this year and then we stop. That is going to be something that we will look to continue the disciplines that we’ve put in place in the last six to nine months.  So definitely getting some short term benefit, definitely you will get some this year.  I wouldn’t promise a lot more than we’re starting to guide to because I think we’re fairly accurate on what we’re likely to achieve this year but I’d like to think that’s a program that we can perpetuate next year and the year after and really in perpetuity there afterwards.
Operator

Your next question comes from Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse.
Philip Winslow – Credit Suisse
Just a question on the server and tools division, clearly there’s a tie to server shipments but as you look out over the next couple of quarters and your commentary on general enterprise spending, when do you think we could actually start to see the inflection point in that line item and how should we think about the services component of that division relative to the license as well?
Christopher P. Liddell
I’ll stick to external forecasts on the underlying server demand and most of the external forecasts are seeing it improve from around now through to next year, so we would expect -- and we subscribe to that -- we would expect it to get less negative as the year goes on and start to improve through next calendar year. The benefit we’re seeing there is mainly like in market share, so we’ve got great attach relative to the server market so as it starts to improve, we’d see the non-annuity component of our revenue start to improve as well, so that should be an evolving trend through the rest of this fiscal year going into the next calendar year.
How quickly that will happen, we’ll see.  I think we’re all waiting to see how well the economy rebounds when it does. We’re still, as I was at the July financial analyst meeting, still on the relatively conservative side. We’re not seeing a large rebound but we’d like to think certainly as we go in to next calendar year we’ll start to see businesses spending again and we’ll be raised with that with good attach.  
On the services side, it’s going to be pretty flat.  I wouldn’t expect that to bounce back quickly so a flattish expectation on the services side certainly through the rest of this fiscal year and going in to the next one would be my starting point.
Operator

Your next question comes from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.
Kash Rangan – Merrill Lynch
Chris, with regard to [inaudible], I was just wondering what are you hearing from corporate?  We’ve been spending some time talking to large corporates that are deploying Windows 7.  It looks like the deployment plans are coming in a little bit earlier than expectations, at least from their standpoint, hearing of the business benefits of deploying Windows 7.  I’m just curious, what are you hearing about the upgrade cycle for Windows 7 in the corporate? Because I would imagine that’s got a pretty significant implication for your business premium mix going into next year because of all the lift you’re getting in the near term seems to be from the consumer side.  
Also, secondarily I was wondering if you could comment on the shrink wrap business pre-orders in consumer channel for Windows 7.
Christopher P. Liddell
On the business side you’re right, anecdotal feedback is certainly good at this stage from corporate in terms of their reaction to Windows 7 and the benefits it brings.  We’re still staying reasonably cautious about the upgrade cycle.  Certainly we expect it to begin next year but we talk about it spreading over maybe a couple of years, so I would like to think we would start to see much better business PC numbers year-over-year next calendar year and I think we’ve been consistent on that on the last couple of calls and we’re still there.  
All of the feedback that we get so far is positive and so that supports a view that we’ll start to see that.  How quickly that will happen, we’re not going to speculate quite yet but certainly all the early signs we’ve got at this stage.  On the shrink wrap or [FPP] side, again we only launched yesterday so it’s a little hard to tell because people are buying in anticipation of demand as opposed to actual demand, but again the --
Kash Rangan – Merrill Lynch
You had pre-order, you were taking pre-orders in the consumer side for that, right?
Christopher P. Liddell
Sure, that’s been very good but that’s small, that’s small.  But that’s been extremely good.  I would say that being right at the top end of our expectations.  Modest financial impact but extremely good sort of reactions so that has been extremely good and the sales in retail we are expecting through the next three months to be very good.
Operator

Your next question comes from Heather Bellini with ISI Group.
Heather Bellini – ISI Group
Chris, you guys have done a phenomenal job on the cost side, surpassing everybody’s expectations.  I was wondering if you could give us your view on whether or not it makes sense to think OpEx in fiscal 2011 might grow at the rate of inflation, just as a general proxy, especially given that the big bear story is that Microsoft will start accelerating its investments and OpEx will start ramping again once top line starts to improve? Thank you.
Christopher P. Liddell
This is the earliest ever for fiscal year 2011 guidance, I think. Okay, I don't see, I really don't want to give a specific number, but I don't see any internal force that is going to significantly increase OpEx in fiscal year 2011 at this stage. I think the disciplines that we have put in place are going to continue at least for that period of time and whilst we will clearly be looking to fund some projects, I'm not going to say it's flat, I don't see it ramping back to anything like what you might have seen before the economic reset in terms of growth.
And that's in particular because at this stage we're still relatively cautious about the economic rebound so I think the fiscal discipline that you have seen will continue certainly for the next, let's say 12 to 18 months.
Now, I caution you with the obvious comment, we're just about to go into our strategic planning round, which then goes into our budgeting round, so that's a directional comments, that's not a specific guidance at this stage.
Operator
Your next question comes from Todd Raker with Deutsche Bank Securities.
Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank Securities
Could you dig into the ASP impact a little bit more in-depth on the netbook side, as you see the OEMs moving from an XP SKU to a Windows 7 starter edition, what does that do to the economics of the low end of the business and how do you think that trends out over the next 12 to 18 months?
Christopher P. Liddell
I would start with the consumer reaction because that's the sort of leading indicator, and how do we feel about the consumer reaction to firstly having Windows on a netbook. Obviously that has been phenomenal, going from zero attached to in the mid-90s. So people are clearly willing to pay for having Windows on their netbook. So that's the sort of first and most important fundamental.
Then in terms of Windows 7 reactions, clearly yet to see but early indications in terms of the OEM build that we're having in the mix that they're putting in terms of Windows 7, is encouraging. Now, it's very early days but encouraging at this stage in terms of their expectations of the number of people who are going to want to see a Windows 7 on their netbook as opposed to an XP.
In terms of the ASP impact, clearly it's almost twice on Windows 7 what it would be on XP, or a significant premium -- awful lot of space, so it's going to be beneficial but I think it's more important symbolically, from our point of view, that people see value in Windows 7 and are willing to pay for it.
Netbooks, even though they have grown fast, they're still a relatively small component of the overall demand. So it's not going to have a massive financial impact but it will certainly help in terms of our ASP comparisons year-over-year, if we get the sort of good attach of Windows 7 that we are starting to see early days of.
Operator
Your next question comes from Sandeep Aggarwal with Collins Stewart.
Sandeep Aggarwal – Collins Stewart
Thanks for taking my question. Chris, the last two or three quarters Microsoft is underperforming in its display advertising business versus the overall industry. Is display advertising getting ignored because of the increasing focus on search? And then how much of online business weakness is coming with you to the Bing cash back and search distribution deals? Thank you. 
Christopher P. Liddell
On the display side, I’d have to say actually we are performing relatively in line, certainly with Yahoo!, when we saw their numbers, so volume and monetization was sort of broadly in line, I would say, with market, so I'm not entirely sure about your underperformance comment, but nevertheless it is difficult and particularly on the monetization side. So we have seen good volume on the display side. We have continued to see that right through the economic reset. That's been growing in double digits on the volume side. 
Where the difficulty has been has been on monetization, so in terms of volume, I would say there is no lack of focus because we are continuing to see good user engagement and demand. On the monetization side, it's been tough and it's clearly because of what's been happening in the overall economy. And I think people have been fixed in to have budgets they might have pushed more in the search side than the display side. We should start to see that improve going forward as we see the economy recover, so I think you will see display start to get better. 
The other thing in display which might be hurting our numbers is just FX. We have a reasonably strong international component, so FX was a headwind in the first quarter. But no lack of focus there, certainly a lot of focus on Search, but there’s plenty of people still working on the Display side.
What was the second part of your questions?
Sandeep Aggarwal – Collins Stewart
It was about is the Bing cash back and search distribution deals, are they causing any weakness in your online business?
Christopher P. Liddell
No, they’re helping a little bit with volume. They’re not helping significantly with the financial side because of the nature of it, but certainly in terms of the market share growth in the quarter, that was negligible from cash back. That was really all the underlying search engine and clearly the marketing and user engagement we got from there, so not much of an impact from that at all in the quarter.
Operator
Your next question comes from Robert Breza with RBC Capital Markets.
Robert Breza – RBC Capital Markets
Just a quick question around PC unit growth -- we’ve seen everything from third party research, everything from 8% to 10% to as high as 12%. Obviously the Windows 7 launch has played a big part in that growth. Any color you can give us about what you think maybe achieved the lower end of that range or maybe the higher end of that range just independent of Microsoft?
Christopher P. Liddell
It’s rebounding very quickly and I think in the quarter you saw relative to where we were three months ago, PC demand rebounded very quickly relative to everyone’s expectations, so it’s very hard because of all of the underpinnings of what’s going to happen in the overall economy.
What I think we’re seeing is the robustness of the concept of the PC -- even through an economic reset, it’s something that people want to spend money on and I think that gives us confidence in the long term trend and the long term ability to have good, potentially double-digit growth in PC demand. And that’s clearly helped by the fact that we’ve got new form factors, Windows 7 helps clearly. You’re just seeing a general positive trend on a long term basis that was a reset. 
What that’s going to mean for the rest of the fiscal year, I think you’re going to continue to see good consumer demand. Clearly that was helping last quarter. I think that will continue. You’re going to see good emerging market demand. That’s really continued right through the last year. It’s been double digit growth in most of the emerging markets right through the last year. I think the consumer in developed markets will start to gradually continue to improve. 
The big theory in my mind is the business PC. That’s been a significant negative -- that’s decreased double digits over the most of the last few quarters and it’s dragged down the numbers.  That can’t continue forever. Eventually those PCs wear out and have to be replaced. So the big variable in terms of rebound is going to be the strength and speed of the business PC refresh cycle. We hope and expect that to be next year. As I said in one of the earlier calls, we’re probably still relatively cautious but when you start to see a rebound in that, plus what we’re seeing in the consumer side, we feel pretty good about what PC demand is going to look like the next calendar year.
Operator
Your next question comes from Katherine Egbert with Jefferies.
Katherine Egbert – Jefferies
Chris, in your prepared comments you talked about the U.S. consumer demand being strong, and you just gave some color on the emerging markets demand. Can you talk about Europe, what you’re seeing there, both on the corporate and the consumer side?
Christopher P. Liddell
Europe is relatively weak. That would probably be the weakest area on a relative basis. So I would start with emerging markets, in particular China and all the major ones. The U.S. recovering a bit, Europe relatively weak so that would be at the low end of all the numbers that I’m seeing.
Katherine Egbert – Jefferies
When can you expect recovery do you think there?
Christopher P. Liddell
I guess when you see economic recovery. It depends on how you feel about that. I think what we’ve said, and I’ll stick with this, even though it was perhaps a bit of unexpected quarter this quarter is this calendar year has transitioned to next calendar year. I feel very good about the dynamics or potential dynamics the next calendar year as we start to see economies improve. You’re seeing economic forecasters expecting economic growth next year globally and in Europe. You are starting to see forecasts for business spending turning [inaudible] with people like Gartner, again on a global basis. So that is going to underpin spending overall. The European consumer, when they will start to get more aggressive, I really don’t know but I don’t expect a lot for the rest of this calendar year. I would start to see it improve the next calendar year.

The next question comes from the line of Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities. 
Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities 
Can you remind us again of when you recognize revenue on Windows in the PC cycle and the PC supply chain cycle, and what type of lag there potentially is between the PC build and your revenue recognition? 
Christopher P. Liddell
When we sell it to the OEMs is when we recognize it. Now they buy licenses in anticipation of selling PCs, obviously. That can vary in terms of their supply chain as to how far in advance and when they actually make a sale and they buy the license. It can vary but on average I would say a couple of months, around eight weeks. People last quarter were buying licenses in anticipation of sales that they are making this quarter and they will be buying licenses now in anticipation of Christmas, for example. It varies depending on the supply chain of the entity but on average, around eight weeks. 
Operator

The next question comes from the line of Tim Klasell with Thomas Weisel Partners. 
Tim Klasell - Thomas Weisel Partners
A follow-up to the prior question, in your OEM revenue bridge you show 4% from Windows attach and inventory. I wonder if you can give us a little color of how much of that 4% is attach, i.e. maybe sort of longer-term sustainable versus inventory which can be pretty volatile? 
Christopher P. Liddell
It is about half and half. It is about half of what we describe as inventory impact and about half attach. On the attach side, there are two impacts there. One is the continuing growth in Netbooks which has a very, very high attach rate. So as they grow slightly faster than non-Netbook PCs, you see attach benefit. And also MNAs, the larger OEMs, we certainly see them gaining market share and they tend to have a higher attach rate than the system builder channel as well. So we are starting to see some attach benefit from that. So those two attach benefits add up to about half of what we show in that line. The other half I would put down to sort of inventory replenishment in the channel. 
Operator

The next question comes from the line of Greg Moskowitz with Auriga. 
Greg Moskowitz – Auriga
As you had pointed out earlier, business spending remains subdued but the license only mix was higher than I had expected. I know you had the benefit of a couple of extra field days relative to the June quarter, but even adjusted for that it showed pretty healthy sequential growth. I was wondering if there was anything you would point to on the business side that perhaps helped transactional billings in the quarter? 
Christopher P. Liddell
No, nothing specific I would point to there. There were a couple of, as you said, there were a couple of days of billing that we had out of the June quarter but then also we lost a day into the next quarter so there wasn’t a significant impact from that. I would just say generally speaking we are seeing good adoption of our products. We have a good product suite out there so I would point to that but there are no underlying trends that I would say were particularly positive. 
As I pointed out in my commentary, really the business cycle was very much as we expected in the quarter and you have to remember what we are seeing now is just people playing out their budgets on the corporate side that were set let’s say in December last year when most people were expecting the world to be very difficult through this year. 
People are just simply spending their budgets that are set to a large extent. It is unlikely that we are going to see a rebound even in this quarter coming up. It is only going to be next year when people reset their budgets for next year in the next few months and perhaps start to take a slightly more optimistic view that we will start to see business spending start to pick up. No particularly positive trends that I would point to other than overall reaction to our product suite. It was fairly much as we anticipated, which was subdued during the quarter. 
Bill Koefoed
Operator, we have time for just one more question.

The next question comes from the line of Richard Williams from Cross Research. 
Richard Williams – Cross Research
I wonder if you could give us some sense of the Windows Live growth rates that you expect over the next couple of quarters. Thank you. 
Christopher P. Liddell
Windows Live is really going to be driven by in particular how we see that monetization come through and that comes back to -- on the strength of the overall economic recovery. I would like to think we are going to see display rates go up as we start to see the economy recover and I think you are starting to see that from us and other people. Or certainly it stopped getting worse and [seems to be stable], I think. I again would probably stick with the same basic line we’ve had on most things, that we’ll start to see some economic improvement on that side as the economy starts to improve but that’s going to be next calendar year more than this calendar year, and it’s probably going to be gradual. That continues to be our base case pretty much across the board for all the things that sort of drive in particular the business side. 
Bill Koefoed

Welcome to the Microsoft fourth quarter 2009 fiscal year conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Koefoed, General Manager, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. 
Bill Koefoed
Thank you, Barb and thanks everyone for joining us today for our fourth quarter earnings call. As usual, here with me are Chris Liddell, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Corporate Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel. 
Today Chris will start with takeaways for the fourth quarter and our 2009 fiscal year. Then I will get into the details of our fourth quarter and then hand it back to Chris, who will discuss our business outlook. After that, we’ll take your questions. 
Our earnings release today includes an addendum of financial highlights which contains more detailed information about revenue, operating expenses, and other items. We have also posted our quarterly financial summary slide deck, which is intended to follow the flow of our prepared remarks, as well as provide a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures that we will talk about today. You can find these documents at the investor relations website at www.microsoft.com/msft. 
Today’s call will be webcast live and recorded. If you decide to ask a question, it will be included in both our live transmission as well as any future use of the recording. You can replay the call at the Microsoft investor relations website until July 23, 2010. 
This conference call is protected by copyright law and international treaties. Unauthorized reproduction or distribution of this report, or any portion of it, without the express permission of Microsoft may result in civil and criminal penalties. 
We will be making statements during this call that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in today’s earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the risk factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. 
Okay, now let’s hear from Chris. 
Christopher P. Liddell
Thanks, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. The fourth quarter marks the end of one of the most difficult but in some ways encouraging fiscal years in the company’s history. Our absolute results were disappointing due to the poor macroeconomic environment and as you’ve seen, revenue in the fourth quarter was down 17% year over year and down 3% for the full year. 
However, I do feel better about our relative performance in fiscal 2009 than I did in fiscal 2008. We actually executed much better than in preceding years across almost all aspects of our business, we had great product shipments, strong sales execution, and a new level of internal discipline shown by the speed and efficiency with which we cut costs. 
So in my mind, we are a stronger company than we were a year ago -- however, the economy continues to be challenging and we need to lift our game to another level in fiscal 2010.
As I said a quarter ago, we see the economy making its way through a [reset] and we expect tough year-over-year comparables for the rest of this calendar year. Having said that, there are some signs that we have at least seen the worst. We began to see sequential stabilization in some of our key businesses; for example, we saw sequential unit increases in both Windows and Windows Server for the first time in a year. 
I am also very pleased with the way in which we are responding to the environment. In the fourth quarter, for example, we cut costs an additional $800 million below the low-end guidance we provided in the third quarter and ended up spending $900 million less than the prior year, adjusted for certain charges. Overall, we pulled back over $3 billion of spending from our original fiscal 2009 guidance. 
Despite cutting costs this year, we also brought to market a strong wave of products in full and on time. Notably, we released SQL Server 2008, Office Communication Server R2, Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and Bing, our major advance search product offering. Over the next 12 months, we will deliver releases in each of our core franchises of Windows, Windows Server, and Office. 
So in summary, our market conditions were clearly difficult in the quarter but we successfully offset most of the impact by focusing on factors inside our control. 
Looking forward, we do not expect trading conditions to improve much but neither in the short-term do we expect them to worsen. They should remain difficult for the balance of this calendar year with the potential for improvement as we look ahead to calendar year 2010. 
With that, I’ll turn the call over to Bill for more details on the fourth quarter. 
Bill Koefoed
Thanks, Chris. I will start with the company all-up view and then go through revenue performance for each of our business units. All of the growth comparisons relate to the corresponding quarter of last year unless I tell you otherwise. 
Overall, revenue declined 17% because of continued weakness in global demand, especially in the business PC and server hardware markets. On top of the economic reset we’ve all experienced this year, remember that we had especially high prior year comparables for our client and entertainment and devices segment. 
The foreign exchange impact on overall revenue was a negative $220 million, or about 1 percentage point in the fourth quarter. 
Revenue for the quarter was also impacted by $276 million in deferrals for the Windows 7 technology guarantee program, which is near the high-end of the guidance we provided in June. 
The weak hardware markets continue to weigh heavily on OEM and license-only revenue, while multi-year annuity licensing revenue grew single digits, in line with the outlook we provided last quarter. 
Our product mix continued to shift toward our annuity licensing, which was up a few points from last year to about 45%. OEM billings accounted for about 25%, license only sales were about 15%, and the balance came from other businesses. 
Within our customer segments, we generally saw last quarter’s trends continue. Specifically, small and mid-market customers are still the hardest hit by the economy and as a result, we are seeing lower overall buying activity. 
In the consumer segment, we are still seeing healthy volumes in our lower priced offerings with softness in our premium offering. 
Our enterprise customer segment remains relatively healthy with EA renewal rates in line with our historical range. As you might expect, the average deal size has been pressured by reduced IT budgets and enterprise employment levels, though we haven’t seen any unnatural discounting. 
We also experienced some sales cycles which pushed deals out of the fiscal year. 
Our sales force closed many of these deals a few days after our fiscal close but in line with our normal deal calendar, which differs slightly from our fiscal calendar. Taking into consideration the impact of these bookings, our unearned revenue and contracted not billed balances were roughly flat year over year. We are very happy with this result, considering the economy relative to a year ago. 
Okay, now let’s move on to the revenue and business drivers by segment, beginning with our thoughts on the PC market. We estimate the overall PC hardware market declined 5% to 7% from last year. Within that, we estimate traditional or non-netbook PCs were down 16% to 18% compared with the year-ago quarter. We’ve seen substantial weakness in the business PC market as reduced IT budgets have delayed hardware purchases and refresh cycles. 
The netbook category remains strong, representing about 11% of the total PC market this quarter. With the growth of netbooks, we estimate the consumer PC market was flat to down slightly year over year. 
On a sequential basis, we estimate the PC market was up low-single-digits. From a geographic perspective, the market was strong in Asia-Pacific, particularly China, as a result of the stimulus programs. In North America, demand appears to have normalized, with sequential sales in line with historic seasonality and in EMEA, we saw demand continue to deteriorate. 
With that backdrop, let’s look at Windows Client. Client revenue was down 22% from last year when adjusting for the Windows 7 tech guarantee. The decline was primarily driven by the underlying PC market dynamics I discussed, combined with the impacts of a difficult comparable to last year. 
Overall OEM unit sales declined 10%, a few points under the overall PC market due to year-over-year inventory fluctuations. If you’ll recall, our fourth quarter of 2008 represents tough comparables as OEMs built inventory above historic levels. 
Attach rates were relatively stable year over year. Strong attach rate gains on netbooks were offset by some attach rate pressure on traditional PCs due to the geographic mix of the PC market, particularly in China where attach rates are lower. 
Again here, I want to note some sequential trends. Sequentially, our OEM units grew slightly ahead of the underlying PC market, mainly driven by netbook growth. This was the first sequential unit growth since the September quarter, so we are pleased to see some stabilization in the market, even though it’s in lower priced units. 
Overall OEM revenue was down 24%, adjusting for the tech guarantee, driven by the PC market dynamics and the mix shifts toward our lower priced netbook offerings. 
Specifically, sales of premiums SKUs declined over 25%, mainly due to the lower sales of business PCs I covered earlier. 
The commercial and retail portion of the client business was down 16%, driven by declines in retail sales prior to the Windows 7 launch. We saw an exciting level of interest in Windows 7 during the pre-order period, although revenue for these sales won’t be recognized until Windows 7 general availability. 
We continue to have healthy growth in our client enterprise annuity business, which was up single digits in the fourth quarter. 
Yesterday Windows 7 was released to manufacturing. This is an exciting milestone for our R&D teams and our partners, delivering not only a terrific product but one that’s nicely ahead of the schedule we committed to almost three years ago. As we’ve announced, Windows 7 general availability will be October 22nd. 
Now let’s move to server and tools, where revenue declined 6%. Our license only and OEM business declined slightly less than the estimated 24% drop in the underlying X86 server hardware market. On a sequential basis, we were pleased to see that Windows server units were up after falling the prior two quarters. Annuity revenue was up single digits, in line with the guidance framework we gave last quarter. FX rate changes were a two-point headwind to revenue during the period. 
We are still seeing great adoption of our virtualization solution, which drove growth of the premium editions of Windows Server and system center to healthy double-digits. 
On a product front, yesterday we announced the Windows Server 2008 R2 release to manufacturing, which builds on the value of Windows Server with live migration and high availability, and together with Windows 7 Enterprise edition provides new capabilities, including direct access and branch cache. 
In addition, during the quarter we released Silverlight 3, which adds new functionality to run Silverlight applications offline. 
Moving on to the online services business, revenue declined 13%. Online advertising revenue was down 14%, mainly due to the significant decline in display advertising rates across the industry. Partially offsetting this was continued growth in page views. 
Search revenue for the quarter was flat year over year despite industry-wide monetization declines. FX rate changes were a headwind of five points to online advertising revenue and three points to total OSB revenue. 
Most significantly for this business, during the quarter we launched Bing, our new search engine which has had positive early momentum. Unique users of Bing.com grew 15% in [Q4]. We’ve seen particular strength in the areas of shopping and travel as visitors to Bing shopping almost tripled and Bing Travel traffic was up 90% month over month since launch. 
It’s still early but we are executing and we are optimistic about the future of this business. 
The Microsoft business division revenue was down 13% due to declines in consumer and business purchasing. Our consumer OEM and retail portions of the business continued to be impacted by slower PC sales, as well as lower ASPs. Pricing promotions drove higher attach rates but overall consumer revenue declined 30%. 
Business revenue was down 10%, driven by an over 35% decline in our license only sales. The annuity portion of this business was up single digits, in line with the outlook we provided last quarter. 
Within the MBD products, we continue to see double-digit growth in our SharePoint, Office Communications Server, and CRM products. CRM achieved the 1 million seat milestone this quarter. 
Our notes conversions remain strong. For the year, we converted 4.7 million notes users to exchange and SharePoint. We’ve seen more and more customers choosing our online business services, which include hosted communication and collaboration solutions like Exchange Online and SharePoint Online. For example, during Q4 we had significant customer wins of over 200,000 seats moving to Exchange and SharePoint Online. 
In the entertainment and devices division, revenue decreased 25%. The Xbox 360 business had a solid quarter, selling about 1.2 million consoles, which is down on a year-over-year basis due to inventory restocking last year. Overall this year, we’ve sold approximately 11 million consoles, 28% above last year. 
Xbox attach rates are still the best in the industry, growing to 8.6 software titles for each console sold. For the year, Xbox Live grew over 50% to more than 20 million members and in the last six months, the number of paid Xbox Live downloads has jumped 73% year over year. 
Now for the rest of the income statement, cost of revenue was down 10% or $280 million, driven by lower Xbox 360 console costs and reduced costs from our consulting and support services, partially offset by increased online distribution costs. 
Operating expenses decreased $766 million, or 11%. This quarter’s results were impacted by $193 million of legal charges and $40 million of additional employee severance charges. Expenses were reduced by the capitalization of $105 million of certain R&D costs related to Windows 7 technical feasibility. 
Adjusting for these items, operating expenses were down about $900 million for Q4. The savings were driven by a combination of strong operational execution, the impacts from lower revenue driven expenses and rigorous cost controls across the company. 
For the year, as Chris mentioned, we took out over $3 billion of operating expenses compared to our original guidance. 
Other income and expenses was a gain of $155 million and includes $108 million of impairments on investments as a result of the market declines earlier this year. 
Our effective tax rate was 26.5% for the quarter, in line with the guidance we provided. 
Diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 8.9 billion, down 5% from the prior year.  
Earnings per share were $0.34. After excluding the net impacts from the legal charges, severance charges, and capitalization of R&D costs, and investment impairments, EPS was $0.36. 
The Windows 7 tech guarantee revenue deferral resulted in an additional $0.02 per share impact on EPS. 
So to wrap up, while the environment clearly remains challenging, we are executing diligently on the areas we can control and in the fourth quarter, we delivered meaningful cost savings and outstanding progress on our product pipeline. 
Lastly, one housekeeping item before I turn the call back over to Chris -- we have included an additional slide in our earnings presentation to help you model some recent organizational and reporting changes we have made which are effective for fiscal year 2010. 
With that, I will hand it back to Chris who is going to discuss our business outlook. 
Christopher P. Liddell
Thanks, Bill. So the rest of the call, I will cover our broad expectations for the first quarter and trends for fiscal 2010. 
So let’s begin with some of the key assumptions on the industry and the economy. We generally expect the economic conditions we saw in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 to continue through the first and second quarters of fiscal 2010. We believe the spending environment is stabilizing on a sequential basis but remained substantially below year-ago levels. 
We see the potential for improvement in calendar year 2010 and acceleration there afterwards, but clearly exact timing is uncertain. 
Regardless of the macroeconomic conditions, we feel extremely good about our relative position and our product delivery plans. Macroeconomics may be the winner in the short-term, but product quality will drive medium term growth. 
So in my view, the shape of the year will therefore be probably the most interesting of any year in recent memory. While I remain cautious overall, particularly in the short-term, we expect to exit the fiscal year with the combined momentum of an improving economy, potentially improving business spend, and an outstanding product lineup. 
With those macro themes, I’ll turn to segment expectations. In the first quarter, client revenue is expected to align to traditional PC shipments, excluding the impact of the tech guarantee program. We expect those traditional PC shipments to decline on a year-on-year basis in the first quarter but be up sequentially, continuing the trend we saw in the fourth quarter of last year. 
In the first quarter, we expect to defer between $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion from the Windows 7 tech guarantee program and presales, the majority of which will be recognized in the second quarter of the fiscal year. 
For the full year, we expect client revenue to align with the total PC market, which factors in the launch of Windows 7 and the resulting impact to retail sales, combined with the anniversary of netbooks in the year-ago comparison. This implies that we could see client revenue growing faster than PC shipments by the end of the fiscal year. 
Microsoft business division revenue, which is approximately 20% consumer and 80% business, is correlated to both the underlying PC market and IT spend. 
We expect consumer revenue in the first quarter to lag traditional PC shipments by several points, continuing the trends in the third and fourth quarters, but also impacted by [higher] inventory levels in the year-ago period. 
For the full year, we also face a normal cyclical slowdown in advance of the next version of Office, which will release to manufacturing in the second half of the fiscal year. 
The business portion of the Microsoft Business Division includes non-annuity and annuity licensing. Business non-annuity sales, approximately 20% of the division, will lag business PC shipments by several points both in the quarter and full year, as a result of the general market weakness of small and mid-market customers, as well as headwinds in advance of the next product cycle. 
The dynamics of the remaining annuity business will be broadly flat for the full year and for the quarter. This helps us buffer through the reset. However, it will be a transition year for MBD and I don’t believe we will see overall revenue growth until we start to see a recovery in the small and medium business and consumer sectors, combined with the impact of Office 2010. 
The server and tools business includes non-annuity components, long-term contractual agreements, and our enterprise services business, which represents approximately 30%, 50%, and 20% of revenue respectively. 
In the first quarter, we expect non-annuity revenue to continue to reflect weakness in the server hardware market, which external analysts expect to decline on a year-over-year basis through the calendar year and then improve in calendar 2010.
We expect server and tools annuity revenue to be mid to low single digits in the first quarter and in the full year. Enterprise services revenue should be broadly flat this coming year. 
Online service business revenue excluding our legacy access business should mirror the online advertising market, which we expect to remain weak in the first quarter and potentially through the year. Display monetization rate should reflect the headwinds seen in broader industry trends but volumes from increased usage should be healthy. 
We also hope to see progress in the search market share as the year proceeds. 
The entertainment and devices division has been resistant to the declines in the gaming industry to date and clearly was a standout in fiscal 2009. Looking forward, weak consumer markets means that we expect industry console sales and attach revenue to moderate in both the first quarter and the full year. These segments represent 60% to 65% of revenue. The balance of the non-gaming business will be impacted by continuing weakness in the underlying PC market. 
Turning to COGS, which next year should increase as a result of three factors -- firstly, we are changing our business model in a number of areas as we transition to the cloud. This means an investment up-front to build out the infrastructure necessary to win in what is clearly a significant area of opportunity. We are also paying for increased distribution in our online offerings. We also expect increases as a result of increased unit volume from the product launch cycle next year. 
Offsetting these increases, we’ve identified and expect to achieve several hundreds of millions of dollars of savings through an internal program focused on efficiencies. The combined impact of these factors will increase COGS as a percentage of revenue by a couple of percentage points. 
I will now turn to our expectation of full year operating expenses -- full year operating expenses we believe will be between $26.6 billion to $26.9 billion, down from the $27.4 billion I communicated in April. And next year, we remain committed to expense control. 
Our effective tax rate next year we expect to be between 25% to 26%, depending on the final mix of revenue, and reflecting the downward trend we’ve seen in recent years. 
Our balance sheet remains extremely strong despite the economic turmoil this past year. This quarter we utilized our Triple A credit rating and issued $3.75 billion of long-term debt and extremely low after-tax cost of 2.3%. We also remain focused on customer credit issues and to date have had an extremely good collection experience.  
We expect fiscal 2010 CapEx to be about $2 billion, down from the $3.1 billion in fiscal 2009, and to stay at or below that level for fiscal 2011 as we continue to focus on cash flow. 
In fiscal 2010, CapEx spend will be below depreciation expense for the first time in years, helping continue the recent trend of free cash flow being greater than net income. 
As I called out in April, capital strength and flexibility will continue to be a focus area for fiscal 2010 but we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
So in summary, like all customers we are adapting to a new and more challenging economy. We remain extremely optimistic about the long-term outlook of our industry and our relative position and we have taken significant actions to strengthen the company while at the same time investing in critical areas and delivering on a significant wave of new products. 
The company is in, in my belief,  the best shape that I’ve seen. 
With that, we look forward to seeing many of you next week at our financial analyst meeting where Steve and our senior leadership team will provide more details about our long-term strategy. 
And now I’ll turn it over to Bill so we can start taking your questions. 
Bill Koefoed
Operator, let’s get going on questions. Can you please hold people to just one question and let’s go ahead and go.
Question-and-Answer Session

Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley.
Adam Holt - Morgan Stanley
Good afternoon. My question is about average selling prices as we head into the upcoming Windows cycle. You know, the premium mix of 59% in the quarter was obviously down quite a bit. As you head into next year, Chris, I believe you talked about the potential to outpace the PC market, which would suggest average selling prices can actually start to go back up. How do you get there? Do you expect to see mix improvement on the consumer side? Are you expecting to see a corporate upgrade cycle? Maybe walk us through A, what you are expecting and B, how you get there?
Christopher P. Liddell
Sure, it’s a great question. On the downside, if I start there and then talk about the upside, on the downside, as we are seeing weak markets in the last couple of quarters and the last year and in particular, the last quarter average PC sales were down sort of in the traditional market 16% to 18% and business was disproportionately badly affected. And because business is typically our highest ASP from a mix point of view, that hurt us on the downside. 
On the upside, as we go into next year, if we start to see, which is certainly my hope, if we start to see the economy improve, business spending improve, and we start to see a refresh cycle in the business PC side of things, which Windows 7 should obviously help facilitate, then you start to see the reverse impact, so hopefully business PC growth will be at or greater than consumer, and so what you will start to see is that our higher average selling price units will have a higher growth rate and hence, ASPs will go up. So hopefully we’ll see a double impact of a better PC market year over year and a better mix in terms of the types of PCs that we are selling relative to average selling prices. 
Adam Holt - Morgan Stanley
Terrific. If I could just ask a quick follow-up, the commentary on expenses for next year, do you anticipate the incremental OpEx cost controls to offset the increase in cost of goods sold?
Christopher P. Liddell
No, they are two different dynamics. We certainly have taken some money out of OpEx and relative to where we started from, certainly quite considerable. I certainly see the focus continuing in that area but we are managing OpEx to a large extent different from COGS. Now, we do actually have a project going looking at COGS opportunities and as I mentioned, I think we have the opportunity to take several hundreds of millions of dollars out of our cost of goods sold through that project. But then we have the dynamic of the changing business models going on and also volume related activities, so that’s really a different dynamic from OpEx, which is driven around, for example, people costs in particular. 
Adam Holt - Morgan Stanley
Thank you. 
Bill Koefoed
Operator, next question. 
Operator
The next question is from Brent Thill with Citigroup.
Brent Thill - Citigroup
Chris, just on the margins coming into the mid-30s, do you feel that margins have now bottomed, considering the ASP expansion as well as your strict operating expense controls for next year?
Christopher P. Liddell
It comes back to some of the commentary I mentioned in my prepared remarks, Brent, which is really around the shape of the year. So I still will see a relatively different difficult economy for certainly the balance of this calendar year and despite the fact that I think we have done a great job on expenses, it’s hard with the margin structure we have to take expenses out proportional to the revenue that we lost. So I would like to think that the expense controls were at the top end of people’s expectations but we still saw margin compression because of the macroeconomics. 
That’s going to be probably a continuation of that trend in the short-term. In the medium term, I certainly think the discipline that we are showing on costs as we continue through the next calendar year and beyond with an improving business cycle with all the products coming on-stream and some of the ASP factors that I mentioned, and certainly we’ve got the promise of margin expansion there afterwards, but I wouldn’t promise that in the short-term. 
Brent Thill - Citigroup
Okay, and just a quick follow-up -- the buy-back, you now have a cash position above $30 billion again. Can you just comment on why the last two quarters, you’ve chosen not to buy back stock?
Christopher P. Liddell
Basically look to -- obviously relatively conservative because in the last couple of quarters, we felt we couldn’t necessarily see the bottom. I think that at least we are seeing signs now of the bottom, so we are feeling more confident looking forward in the outlook, even though as I see it, I -- I see it going along the bottom for some period of time. 
I was more conservative from a financial point of view six months ago and even three months ago, if you’ll recall my remarks. I said it was going to be tough for the rest of the calendar year and we are really still not sure we are out of the woods. Now, I’ll still say that but I guess we are feeling better about the economic environment but unless, in that last six months, conservatism won over the natural desire to buy back shares, and we did accelerate the buy-back to some extent in the first six months of the year, so even for this fiscal year in total, we bought back around $8 billion of shares, which was close to our net free cash flow. So we front-ended it a bit in the first six months of the year and then just took a very conservative stance in the second half. 
Bill Koefoed
Okay, Operator, next question and guys, let’s stick to one question, please. 
Operator
The next question is from  Sarah Friar from Goldman Sachs.
Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs
Could you give us a little bit of commentary on what you have heard from customers in terms of both their willingness to start a Windows 7 upgrade? So you are clearly signing a lot of ELAs this quarter. They must have been talking about that. 
And then secondarily, in server and tools, do you also feel like there was any pent-up demand ahead of the new product upgrade cycle in the June quarter, and now you have that launched as we look into September?
Christopher P. Liddell
I’ll start with server and tools first, Sarah -- the market is still very weak and Bill mentioned server shipments were down, I think it was 24% for the quarter. So I don’t think we are yet seeing too much pent-up demand in the server area. 
As it turned out, even though our results were relatively weak, they were better than the server shipment numbers, so the division lost 6% in revenue but that 6% is relative to a 24% decline in server shipments. So we are certainly feeling good about our relative position but I would contrast that and say we don’t yet see a lot of pent-up demand in that area. 
Going into next year, sure. But it’s really macro conditions are going to continue to trump everything. We really need to see an increase in IT spending before I feel confident that we are really going to see an acceleration back in the server and tools area. 
Now, I’ve seen your forecasts and everyone else’s, and I think most people are saying we’re probably at about the bottom in the server area. We are probably going to be that way for a quarter or two and then things improve next year. That’s internally consistent with the way  that we see things as well, plus then we start to get the benefit of the new  server product and the new SQL product, so it’s a consistent story in the server area as it is in the PC area. 
When you go to PCs, we haven’t heard a lot of early discussion about how people are going to put Windows 7 in but again, it’s that same general sense of optimism that once we get through this year, people start to reset their budgets for next year, clearly a lot of businesses have extended their refresh cycle because of overall economics. They can only do that for so long. As they start to look into next year, hopefully a slightly better economic outlook, they start to look at refreshing their PCs and they have Windows 7 availability, then you start to get into a much more virtuous cycle. 
So there’s similar commentary to what we see in server and tools -- nothing immediately on the horizon but potentially start to see some positives next year. 
Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs
Got it. Great, thank you. 
Bill Koefoed
Operator, next question, please.
Operator
The next question is from  Brad Reback with Oppenheimer.
Brad Reback - Oppenheimer 
Chris, just to clarify a point -- as you talk about the economic rebound or the expected rebound and volume rebound in the back half of the fiscal year, just to be clear on the expense side of the equation, is the organization at a place where we can be fairly confident that the upside is not reinvested into the business as we’ve seen in other cycles?
Christopher P. Liddell
Yes, certainly for this fiscal year, I don’t see any potential for us to significantly vary from the numbers that I gave you. The only reason why it would would be something outside our control, like foreign exchange, so some of our expenses are outside the U.S., if we saw a significant change in the FX rate, then I can’t influence that. And things like some of our volume related expenses, so if we saw a really strong pick-up in some of our enterprise sales, some of our revenue driven expenses might increase. 
But in terms of things, which is the great bulk of the expenses which are totally inside our control, I don’t see any potential for us to blow expenses this year. 
Brad Reback - Oppenheimer 
Great. Thanks very much. 
Bill Koefoed
Operator, next question, please.
Operator
The next question is from Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities.
Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities
Chris, you had talked about September client revenue growing in line with traditional PCs and in the most recent quarter, we saw that you guys declined about 600 basis points more than traditional PCs. What accounts for the difference from this quarter to next quarter that would I guess raise you back up to the decline in the traditional PC rate?
Christopher P. Liddell
The biggest single factor is just inventory changes. We still saw inventory contraction in the fourth quarter, the one we just finished, relative to a year ago. So some of the other parties out there saw positive inventory. We were relatively late in the cycle so we saw inventory contraction and that cost us a lot of that 600 points that you mentioned year over year. 
As we start to go into this year and clearly Windows 7 is just around the corner, then we start to see that inventory position stabilize and even potentially over the course of the year start to actually get better on a year-over-year basis, which is one of the reasons why I feel better not only about the first quarter but how we might exit the year as well. 
Bill Koefoed
Operator, next question, please.
Operator
The next question is from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.
Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse
I have a question back on expenses again -- if you guys ex out some of those one-time charges, you know, the legal charges, severance, et cetera, FX, R&D costs, you ran an OpEx about 25.5 this year and obviously you are guiding 26.6, 26.9 next year. Just given the fact that most of the headcount reductions occurred in the second half of the fiscal year, how should I think about that increase in OpEx that you are guiding towards? Is it just a little bit of conservatism or is it because of all the product launches that you do have coming out, you know, marketing investment, sales, et cetera. How should I just think about that increase?
Christopher P. Liddell
Sure. We set our budgets a month or two ago before we saw some of the savings that we had in the fourth quarter, so that’s the first point to make. 
In terms of the year-over-year, the factors that are likely to see an increase are, as you mentioned, we’ve got some fairly significant product launches next year, so we do have some marketing associated with those that we are intending to spend. We are seeing some other factors, like non-cash charges associated with depreciations, so even though CapEx is going down next year, some of the deprecation [inaudible] from the increasing CapEx is starting to feed through. 
Stock comp, which is also non-cash, is going up as we layer investing. Acquisition amortization, if we do any acquisitions, which we provide for, some of the non-cash amortization will impact expenses next year as well, and then we have [inaudible] from pay raises last year, so we’ve got no pay raises this year but we did have some pay raises last year, so the full year impact of those. 
So there’s a series of relatively small items which add up to the increase that you are seeing. But we did, as I mentioned, we did actually cut back expense to for next year, despite all of those things which are likely to happen. We did cut them back from where we originally were. 
Bill Koefoed
Operator, next question, please.
Operator
The next question is from Todd Raker with Deutsche Bank.
Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank
I just wanted to dig back into unearned revenue. I didn’t quite understand the discussion in terms of timing -- that was flat year over year. So if you could just touch on that, and if you just talk about the annuity business in general, are you seeing any indications that the annuity business is decelerating, even ahead of a Win 7 product cycle?
Christopher P. Liddell
We have a slight difference in timing with our field year relative to our fiscal year. Our fiscal year is clearly June 30 but our field year can be either a day or two short of that or a day or two longer than that, just in terms of -- depending on whether they -- when they close their books. 
So from a fiscal year point of view, unearned was down but if you include the couple of days after the fiscal year to when the field closes their books, then it was basically flat and that’s how we tend to look at it internally because that’s the -- the field cycle is what essentially drives customer behavior. 
So essentially flat is either half full or half empty, depending on how you look at it. Half empty is zero is down from the double-digits that we were getting in previous years; the half full is getting flat bookings in the current environment, which is the worst economic contraction of our lifetime, is actually heroic effort in terms of our field sales. So inside that flat bookings or flat billings, you are basically seeing two dynamics. The renewal rate is similar to what we have been receiving traditionally, so that -- from two-thirds to three-quarters renewal rate that we have quoted in previous years actually held true this year, which was a very good performance from the field. 
What we are seeing that is different which is meaning that we are flat rather than double-digit increase, is that the people aren’t increasing the number of seats that they are taking, so clearly an environment that we’ve got, most businesses are flat in headcount or even contracting, so you are not seeing that uplift from the increased number of seats. And people are much more conservative with what they are buying, so we are getting certainly good growth from things like SharePoint but that’s really just holding the line in terms of keeping them dollar for dollar with the rate at which they are coming off. 
So average level of -- you know, on a contract by contract basis, the number that we renewed in line with history, what’s changing is the dollar value of those contracts, which is leading to sort of flat year-over-year performance.

The next question is from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.
Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch
Thank you very much. When I look at the deferred revenues, it looks like we definitely got a sequential improvement, so that’s got to give you some visibility. And Chris, you also talked about the transactional revenues which I think you quantified to be down 20% year over year in the March quarter. I was wondering how that metric fared in the June quarter and should we think about that metric in the June quarter as potentially the bottom, because the other pieces of your business are fairly coming off the balance sheet, if you will? So I’m just wondering if -- whatever that transactional growth was in the quarter or contraction was in the quarter, do you really think that this could be the bottom and that that transaction growth could actually pick up in the September quarter and beyond?
Christopher P. Liddell
The transactional business, it depends on whether you are talking about client, server and tools, or MBD -- 
Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch
Combined, everything combined. 
Christopher P. Liddell
Yeah, it’s in the 20% to 25% contraction if you do all of those combined. So if you think about  overall PCs down sort of that 18, 16%, 18%, you see server and tools, server hardware down 24%. Then the transactional business really follows those quite closely, adjusted for things like inventory, that I mentioned before. So if you think on average that our underlying hardware shipment decreases were in the 20% to 25% range on average, then that’s what the transactional business was as well, plus or minus a little bit. 
So do I think that’s the bottom? Yes, I do think that’s the bottom but as I probably said in my prepared remarks, I think it’s probably going to continue to be tough for a quarter or two so I wouldn’t necessarily promise that it’s going to be significantly better but if you look at a combination of say the first and second quarter, that’s the first half of the year, then that’s probably a good surrogate for the transactional business for the second half of the calendar year, the first half of this fiscal year and the confidence of that is really in terms of that sequential trend that we mentioned in our prepared remarks. 
Bill Koefoed
Doe that help, Kash?
Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch
Yes, and just a clarification on the COGS, you said you were working on some internal initiatives to drive COGS down, and you also said that given the transition of the cloud, that COGS was going to go up by 200 basis points. Were you talking net or gross? That is, in other words, COGS goes up by 200 basis points but you also have these internal initiatives that could drive COGS down by hundreds of millions of dollars, so should the net number then be lower than the 2% of revenue hit? 
Christopher P. Liddell
The 2% is net of the initiatives that we’ve seen. Now clearly if we outperform on that, we will offset it by more but that was a net figure that I was giving you, so the combination of the infrastructure costs associated with that, some of the distribution deals that we’ve done, the volume related, because clearly with the Windows 7 launch, that has a lot of COGS associated with it, is offset by the things I talked about to give the 2% decrease. 
Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch
Got it -- increase, you mean?
Christopher P. Liddell
Increase, decrease in gross margin . 
Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch
Okay, got it. Thanks.

Operator, next question, please.

The next question is from  John DiFuca with J.P. Morgan.
John DiFuca - J.P. Morgan 
Thank you. I have a follow-up to Brendan’s question earlier -- a question on the channel effect on client. Chris, a few quarters ago, you said that client was negatively affected by I think 2 percentage points and then last quarter I think you said there was a slight negative effect. Now this quarter it sounds like it’s the majority of that six percentage point delta between OEM and PC shipments. I guess two things here -- well first, I would think that this is a cumulative effect, so when it comes back and it does reverse, how would you think this will come in? Will it come in over a long period of time when inventories build? Or is this going to come in relatively quickly in one or two quarters? I know you are not suggesting it is coming in anytime soon, the economy is weak out there. 
And the second point, why wouldn’t it happen, you know, soon? Like next quarter? It does sound like some of the component vendors benefited from inventory restocking this quarter, so why wouldn’t -- you do say you guys are later and you lag but why would it be a long lag?
Christopher P. Liddell
All great questions -- so first to start with the underlying math, assuming inventory went down three quarters ago and stayed down, then year over year you are always going to have a negative, so the fact that it’s negative quarter after quarter doesn’t mean that it’s continuing to contract. It just means it contracted and stayed down. 
Having said that, in the fourth quarter contracted a bit more and you’re right, the two or three basis points of slippage that we saw in the second and third quarter were more like 3% or 4%, so the majority of that 6% in the fourth quarter. So it was a little bit higher there but also we are always talking about year over year, so just recall that. 
To the second half of your question, you are correct, it could come back quite quickly and in our modeling is likely to in the first and second quarter. So we will see a positive impact on that. 
The reason why I say that in the first quarter revenue is more likely to be close to underlying market growth is that even though we will start to get a positive inventory,  I don’t think we’ll start to get the positive ASP benefit from business sales that I talked about, so that will still potentially be a slight negative, and that won’t start coming back until let’s say the first half of next year. Then you get into the first half of next year, you get the positive inventory impact because it will go back up and hopefully stay back up and you start to get the business cycle as well, so you start to get both of them being positive rather than offsetting. Does that make sense?
John DiFuca - J.P. Morgan 
Yeah, it does. That’s very helpful, thanks. 
Bill Koefoed
Operator, next question, please.

The next question is from Tim Klasell with Thomas Weisel Partners.
Tim Klasell - Thomas Weisel Partners
Good afternoon, everybody. My question has to do with the Office 2010 launch and actually, I think you’ve got the entire productivity stack launching next year. Can you sort of guide us through how you think that will affect revenues? Will there be a burst afterwards like we see in Windows 7 or can you help us sort of think about our models going into next year with the business division?
Christopher P. Liddell
Given that it’s going to launch in the fall of next year, I don’t really see a significant impact in 2010 as a result of it. In fact, again, we could start to -- it could be a headwind for the first half, then start to turn around in the second half and you start to see a very good situation in terms of 2011, but if you’re just trying to model 2010, it’s not going to be a significant positive. 
It will certainly help in terms of annuity sale and help mitigate some of the negative transactional impacts that we are seeing, so some of the signing up annuities that I mentioned, people are looking forward to Office 2010, some of the new business that we are signing, as well as some of the other products that are coming up in that division, for example, SharePoint and Office Communication Server. 
So it will be a slow burn in terms of MBD. I think we’ll see a more positive earlier trend than server and tools and client but MBD to my mind is pretty much a 2011 story, not a 2010. 
Tim Klasell - Thomas Weisel Partners
Very good. Thank you.

The next question is from Katherine Egbert with Jefferies.
Katherine Egbert - Jefferies
Good afternoon. Chris, you’ve given a pretty tight range of guidance for operating expenditures for fiscal ’10, especially give how much cost you took out in the back half of fiscal ’09, I mean, I’m struggling a little bit with -- I mean, is revenue going to grow next year and can you handicap why that range is so tight? What happens if revenue is significantly better or worse -- will it still stay there?
Christopher P. Liddell
As I mentioned, we have a very -- what I described as a very tight rein on costs and I think you saw that in the performance this year. So I am feeling very good about the organization’s ability to keep a tight control on costs across the board in terms of things like headcount, which we look at on a month-by-month basis, in terms of cost per head, salary increases, which are zero this year -- it’s going to be hard to vary much from zero. Costs per head in terms of travel and entertainment, the things that we can control through a very good cost control mechanism, I think we have a good handle on and therefore I don’t feel exposed in terms of it peaking or troughing much from it. 
In terms of some of the areas where we don’t control our revenue driven expenses, you know, for example, money that we might pay our partners if they outperform on revenue, yes, those could go up and therefore that number could go outside that range as a result of that. I guess I would say if that’s the case and revenue outperforms and it costs us a little bit more expense, it’s probably a positive thing and we’ll explain it at the time. But in terms of the great bulk of expenses which are very much around our people internally, I feel good that we have handle on those. 
Katherine Egbert - Jefferies
Okay, very good. Thanks.

The next question is from Sandeep Aggarwal with Collins Stewart.
Sandeep Aggarwal - Collins Stewart
Thanks for taking my question. Chris, I have one platform related question -- as you know, Google announced the launch of Chrome OS for netbook in 2010. In your view, is there really a need for an OS that can handle online services and cloud client computing better than Windows and how do you think Microsoft is to respond to that kind of competitive move? Thank you. 
Christopher P. Liddell
Sure, I mean, we’ve been fighting free OS in the client area for quite some time, as you all know, and I would point to the general value that we think Windows has and in particular around Windows 7, which we think is going to be our best ever operating system, and we still believe that the very, very, very large majority of people are going to want both a client and an Internet based experience on their PC, so of course people want to surf the Internet and access. They can do that quite freely with Windows and all the Internet Explorer and choices that they have, so a browser only based like software may have applicability as it does with Linux based systems already, but we don’t see that significantly changing just because of Chrome OS coming out. 
Bill Koefoed
All right, Operator, let’s have one final question. 
Operator
The last question is from  Robert Breza with RBC Capital Markets.
Robert Breza - RBC Capital Markets
Chris, I just wanted to get your thoughts as you look out here -- do you see much change from a geographic perspective? I mean, I would love to just get your thoughts from an economic perspective as you are looking out across the different geographies -- do you see much variance between North America, Europe, and maybe how we should think about that going from the first half to the second half of the year? Thanks. 
Christopher P. Liddell
Sure. If I cluster the areas into I guess four -- let’s do it in four, which would be Europe, North America, Asia non-Japan, and Japan, I would say that we are most encouraged in Asia in general developed markets, so we are starting to see reasonable growth in those areas. Now, that tends to be our lowest ASP market, so it’s not helping us enormously but nevertheless, when we look out, we would say that to the extent that there’s a -- we come out of a global recession, those are the areas that are going to be the first to come out of it and we see positive growth. 
Next in line would be North America, which is still obviously very tough but relative to say Europe and Japan, is just looking in better shape and that’s as much anecdotal as it is macroeconomic, just in terms of our sales force and talking to them and looking at our budgeting for next year. 
So I’ve rank ordered them emerging markets, North America, and then right at the tail end, Western Europe and Japan.

Welcome to the Microsoft Third Quarter 2009 Fiscal Year Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. (Operator instructions) Today’s call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Bill Koefoed, General Manager, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Bill Koefoed
Thank you, Barb, and thanks everyone for joining us today on our third quarter earnings call. I am joined today by Chris Liddell, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Corporate Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel.
The format for today’s call will be as follows. Chris will summarize some of the key take-aways for the quarter. I will then provide details around our third quarter results, and then hand it back to Chris for a more detailed discussion of our business outlook. After that, we’ll take your questions.
Please be aware that we filed our Form 10-Q today in conjunction with our earnings release. We have also posted our quarterly financial summary slide deck, which is intended to follow the flow of our prepared remarks, as well as provide a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures that we will talk about today. You can find these documents at the Investor Relations website at www.microsoft.com/msft.
Today’s call will be webcast live and recorded. Please be aware that if you decide to ask a question, it will be included in both our live transmission as well as any future use of the recording.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.
And now, I’ll turn the call over to Chris.
Chris Liddell
Thanks Bill. Our third quarter results reflect the combination of two forces, firstly the most difficult economic environment the company has faced in our 30 year history, about offset by company specific factors. On the macroeconomic front, we saw a broad-based slowdown across virtually all product lines and geographies. Our transactional revenues, for example, and our emerging markets, in particular, were impacted by the economic reset that we are all seeing with demand down as much as 15% to 20%.
Against that backdrop, while I can't be happy with any quarter where our revenue and earnings per share decreased, I was actually pleased with our relative performance. First, our annuity licensing held up well, reflecting the strength of our diversified business model. Second, we managed expenses significantly below our expectations going into the quarter, which is a credit to our employees' ability to adapt to a new reality. And third, despite all the distractions, including the first significant layoffs the company has ever implemented, we executed on our product development milestones.
Globally, overall IT spend, in particular, business hardware purchasing continued to slow from the levels seen in the second quarter and severely impacted transactional license sales in our client Microsoft business division and server and tools businesses. We did see some pockets of strength reflecting consumers' desire to purchase down the price points. For example, we saw healthy unit volumes at netbooks, office suites at retail and Xbox 360 consoles.
Geographically mature markets slowed noticeably, while emerging markets, which has historically been sources of strong revenue growth for us reported even deeper declines than mature markets. Our annuity business is clearly our bright spot. With strong sales execution, corporate customers are renewing their long-term commitment with us, which reflects both the value of our current product portfolio and anticipated future product innovation.
On the expense side, we executed against cost-saving initiatives with production down across the board, marketing, vendor costs, and other discretionary spend, as well as a reduction in headcount and headcount related costs, and lower capital expenditure. We ended the quarter with 800 less employees than we started the quarter with, and importantly, we're also seeing our people focus on efficiency and the need for fiscal discipline.
We accomplished this while also focusing on operational excellence. This quarter, we made significant product development progress towards the next wave of product and services. Over the next 18 months, we will be delivering updates to our core franchises, namely Windows 7, Windows Server and Office 2010, as well as bringing new services like Windows Azure to market.
So in summary, we remain cautious – more cautious than most about the state of the world economy. Our globally diversified business gives us insight into a world where economic pressures are both broad and deep. While we would all like to think that a recovery will be short and painless, we unfortunately believe that it'll be so and gradual. We expect trading conditions to remain very difficult through the next quarter and potentially through the balance of this calendar year.
Against that backdrop, we have to focus on our relative performance. We have the benefit of a strong annuity business, which partially insulates us. We can continue to be tight on costs. We can continue to focus on maximizing the strongest cash flow of any company in the industry, and we will continue to launch a counter cyclical wave of products over the next 12 to 18 months, which will help growth in fiscal year 2010 and beyond.
So with those high-level themes, I will turn the call over to Bill for some more details on the third quarter.
Bill Koefoed
Thanks. As Chris mentioned, our revenue results were impacted by a weak macro economic environment. However, strong execution on our cost initiatives helped to offset the impact to operating income. I'm going to provide you with details on our financial performance. I'll start with the overall company business and financial momentum points and then follow up with revenue performance for each of the business units. All growth comparisons I mention relates to the comparable year of last year unless otherwise specified.
Overall, revenue declined 6% to $13.6 billion, due to continued weakness in global demand, particularly in the business PC and server hardware market. Despite this revenue shortfall, excluding the $0.06 of charges related to severance and investment impairments, earnings per share for the quarter were $0.39, in line with expectations. Within the business results, the transactional portions of our business are down substantially as a result of weakness in the associated market while our annuity business remains healthy.
Within our customer segment, small and mid market customers remain the most severely impacted by the current economic conditions. In the consumer segment, we have seen healthy volumes in the lower-priced products, but experienced weakness in the higher -priced SKUs as can be expected in this environment. The enterprise customer segment has held up and renewal rates were stable and within our historical range.
Driven by these dynamics, our product billing mix continues to shift toward our annuity licensing, which is up five percentage points from the prior year to about 35%. The remaining billing mix is approximately 30% from OEMs, 15% from transactional license only sales, with the balance from our other businesses.
Unearned revenue grew 1% year-over-year to $12.3 billion. Our contracted not billed balance exceeds $12.5 billion and was also up year-over-year. Overall, total bookings for the company declined 15% driven by the declines in the transactional portions of our business. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations did not materially impact overall revenue growth this quarter.
Now let me move to the revenue and business drivers by segment beginning with Windows client. I will start with some commentary on the PC market. We saw continued deterioration in the overall PC hardware market, which we estimate to have declined 7% to 9%. Traditional or non-netbook PCs were down 15% to 17% compared with the year ago quarter. We have seen continued weakness in the business segment of the PC market as companies cut their IT hardware spending and extended hardware refresh cycles.
The small notebook PCs or netbook category in the market continued its growth and represented about 10% of the total PC shipments for the quarter. Unit sales in the consumer segment of the market benefited from the growth in the netbook category and were about flat year-over-year. So with that market context, let me move on to client.
Client revenue was $3.4 billion, down 16% from a year ago. This decline is consistent with the framework we provided to you last quarter with client revenue declining in line with the traditional portion of the PC hardware market. Overall OEM unit sales declined 6% performing slightly better than the overall PC market due to attach rate improvement. The particularly strong attach rate in netbooks illustrate that customers continue to prefer Windows.
OEM revenue was down 19% driven by the dynamics in the underlying PC market. Specifically, sales of premium SKUs were down over 20%, primarily due to the declines in the traditional business PC market, I mentioned. Partially offsetting the decline in premium units was strong growth in our lower price netbook software.
The commercial and retail portion of the client business grew 1%. The enterprise annuity business continued to have healthy growth. This growth was partially offset by lower retail sales attributable to general consumer spending softness, as well as some normal slowing ahead of a major product release.
Against the current economic backdrop, the client revenue remained – the client division remained focused on execution and delivering on the product pipeline. During the quarter, we released the public beta of Windows 7. We feel very good about the response we are getting to Windows 7 beta testers and our progress against the next milestone, which is the release candidate. We also delivered significant innovations to the browser with the release of Internet Explorer 8, which has also received strong press and analyst reviews. We remain very positive about the client product pipeline and its ability to drive long-term growth for the company.
On the marketing side, we have seen a measurable perception increase for Windows from our recent advertising campaigns. Specifically, our research shows that 10% increase in preference for Windows PC since these campaigns launched.
Now let us move to server and tools where revenues grew 7% to $3.5 billion. Revenue was driven by double-digit growth in our enterprise annuity business from sales of premium editions of Windows Server 2008 and SQL Server 2008 in addition to strong growth in System Center Management suite. The consulting and support services portion of server and tools revenue grew 6%. Revenue from the transactional and OEM portions of the business declined over 15% during the quarter in line with the estimates for the underlying x86 server hardware market.
Industry analysts continue to publish healthy market share performance for Windows Server 2008, a validation of the competitive benefit it provides the customers. On the product front, the server and tools division delivered the beta release of Windows Server 2008 R2, which builds on the value of Windows server, with new features like live migration. In addition, we released the beta version of Silverlight 3, which delivers new functionality to run Silverlight applications off-line.
Moving on to the online services business, revenue declined $122 million or 14%. Online advertising revenue was down 16% primarily due to the significant decline in display advertising rates across the industry. Partially offsetting this was continued growth in both page views and search queries. The Microsoft business division had revenues of $4.5 billion, which declined 5% due to declines in non-annuity licensing. This transactional revenue was primarily impacted by the traditional PC market decline. We increased attach with pricing promotion, but due to lower prices and PC sales, overall transactional revenue declined more than 25%. This decline was partially offset by healthy 15% revenue growth from our annuity business.
In the quarter, we continued to see strong demand in our SharePoint, Office Communications Server and CRM products, which all grew more than 20%. On the product front, during the quarter, we released a new version of our unified communications offering, with Office Communications Server 2007 R2. Additionally, last week, we announced the timeline for our next release of Office 2010 and made available the beta version of Exchange 2010, which will be for sale in the second half of calendar 2009.
Moving to the entertainment devices division, revenue decreased 2% to $1.6 billion. The Xbox 360 business had a very strong quarter selling over 1.7 million consoles. This represents growth of almost 30% over the prior year. This fiscal year to date, we have already sold approximately 10 million consoles, about 15% more than we sold in all of last year. Attach rates for Xbox continue to lead the industry with software attach rates growing to 8.3 and accessories attach rates growing to 3.9.
In addition, Xbox Live is a key differentiator for our platform. For example, 1 million Xbox Live gold members have activated Netflix on Xbox Live. You'll hear more about our Xbox Live progress at E3 in June. During the quarter, we unveiled Windows Mobile 6.5, the next version of our Windows Mobile software platform. You can expect to see phones running Windows Mobile 6.5 by the fourth quarter of this calendar year.
Now for the rest of the income statement. Cost of revenue increased 12% primarily driven by increased distribution and data center costs. Operating expenses decreased $1.3 billion or 16%. This year's results were impacted by $290 million of employee severance charges, as a result of our announced plan to eliminate up to 5,000 positions. Prior year's results included $1.4 million in certain legal charges. Adjusting for these items, operating expenses were down 2% year-over-year and 10% sequentially, due to our focus on efficiency that Chris described earlier.
Operating income of $4.4 billion was up 3% but down 17% after adjusting for impacts of the employees' severance and legal charges from the current and prior years. Other income and expense was a net loss of $388 million and includes $420 million of impairment charges on investments, primary due to the continued declines in the market. Given the uncertainty and volatility of marketing conditions, we remain focused on cash and working capital management.
The company generated $5.4 billion or $0.61 per share in free cash flow this quarter, reflecting moderated operating expenses and capital expenditures. We have maintained our AAA debt rating and rebuild cash to over $25 billion while returning $1.2 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends. Our effective tax rate was 26.5% for the quarter in line with guidance we provided. Diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were $8.9 billion, down 6% from the prior year. As I mentioned earlier, excluding the severance and impairment charges of $0.06, earnings per share for the quarter were $0.39, meeting expectations.
So in summary, we remain focused in the areas we can control and in the third control delivered meaningful cost savings and significant progress on our product pipeline. With that, let me turn it back to Chris who will provide you with more insight into our business outlook.
Chris Liddell
Thanks. For the remainder of the call, I will speak to our broad expectations for the fourth quarter and our preliminary view of fiscal year 2010. As I mentioned in the opening remarks, we witnessed deterioration of spending levels through the third quarter as macro factors pressured hardware market's IT budgets and advertisement spend. In the fourth quarter, we expect the overall spending environment to remain difficult.
Given the numerous underlying trends though, rather than providing a static quantitative revenue and earnings per share guidance, we recommend that you look at the market drivers of our business using the following framework. In the client business, PC shipments remained the primary driver of revenue, and we expect traditional PC shipments, both excluding netbooks to remain weak. In the fourth quarter, we expect client revenue to be in line with or slightly below the growth rate in the traditional PC market, based on a year ago comparable which had higher than normal levels of inventory at OEM and at retail, and continued weakness of business PC demand, which has a higher associated selling price. We expect the netbooks mix of total PCs to follow the trends seem in Q3.
In the Microsoft business division, traditional consumer and business PC shipments remained the primary drivers of approximately 40% of the segment's revenue, which is transactional in nature. This revenue is the most susceptible to the volatile market conditions. In the fourth quarter, we expect this part of the revenue to lag traditional PC shipments by several points, the result of general purchasing power weakness from small and mid market customers, and continued inventory contraction and retail and our OEMs.
The remaining 60% of MBD revenue is from annuity licensing, which is being supported by the strength of new growth businesses like SharePoint and unified communications. In the fourth quarter, we expect positive annuity growth of single digits, slightly ahead of overall IT spend. The pipeline for annuity contracts in the fourth quarter includes a large renewal wave, which we are optimistic on closing given our year-to-date performance, but there are clearly risks from lengthening sales cycles.
Like MBD, the server and tools segment includes both transactional and annuity licensing components. We expect the transactional portion of the business, which is about 30% of the total, to generally align to the server hardware market. Third-party analysts expect both server hardware shipments to be consistent with the third quarter and therefore remain weak. The remaining annuity licensing and enterprise services portion of the server and tools segment will trend towards overall IT spend.
Our OSB revenue, excluding our legacy Access business, should mirror the online advertising spending market. Volume should continue to increase but monetization rates, in particular, the display advertising portion of our business will remain under pressure. The entertainment devices division primary driver remains consumer sentiment and spending. Our overall market position and volume remains very good, but console revenue, representing 30% of the segment should decline in the fourth quarter as a result of our earlier pricing actions and a mix shift to lower priced consoles.
Console attach rate of revenue representing another 30% of revenue should benefit on a year-over-year basis from the increased install base of consoles, partially offset by moderating attach rates. The other non-gaming portions of the business should be impacted by the underlying PC market and overall consumer spending behavior. In summary, the transactional, consumers and advertising revenue will remain under significant pressure until market conditions improve, offset by annuity revenue, which will start to converge with, but still outperform overall IT spend.
With those things on revenue, I will turn to our expectations of fourth quarter operating expenses. Given the progress made on cost reductions in the third quarter, we're further reducing our full year operating expense guidance by up to $1 billion from the guidance we provided to you last quarter of $27.4 billion. This is on top of the $1.5 billion decrease we forecast in our January call, so it totals up to $2.5 billion of savings from our original July guidance last year. We now expect fiscal 2009 operating expenses to be between $26.7 billion and $26.9 billion. This forecast includes the $290 million severance charges, which were not in the prior forecast.
We also now expect capital expenditure to come in at $3.1 billion, an additional $200 million below our January guidance, and some $900 million lower than our expectations at the beginning of the year. Moving to the other drivers of earnings per share, we continue to expect an effective tax rate of 26.5% for the fourth quarter. Other income will be largely dependent on market movements.
So I would like to spend a few minutes looking ahead to fiscal year 2010. Our planning expectation is that macro conditions remain very challenging through the remainder of this 2009 calendar year, which covers the first half of our fiscal year. Third-party analysts generally expect continued decline in the demand for PC and server hardware, which as I told earlier, will likely impact the non-annuity components of our Microsoft business division, client and server and tools segments. Growth in the annuity portions of our business should still outperform non-annuity or moderate reflecting the lower growth rate in bookings. We expect the volatility seen in emerging markets to continue.
In calendar year 2010, there is some potential for market conditions to improve, but it is clearly too soon to call. Many third-party economists are predicting the re-emergence of GDP growth, which should favorably impact IT spend, hardware markets and advertising spend. We will also begin to benefit from favorable year over year comparables in the second half of fiscal 2010. And finally, we will begin to see the impact from the next wave of new products coming to market. As to COGS, cost of goods sold, next year, we should expect to continued growth driven by increasing costs and the distribution deals we signed in fiscal year 2009 ramp and more of our business goes towards the software plus services model.
In January, we shared with you a preliminary estimate for operating expenses in fiscal year 2010 of $27.4 billion. We are currently in the process of finalizing next year's budget, and while we are looking for additional opportunities to save, we will provide you with an updated view of fiscal year 2010 operating expense in July.
The headcount, as I mentioned in last quarter's call, we are committed to eliminating 5,000 positions by July 2010. In addition, we said we would make cuts in our cost of goods sold stopping. We're making progress on that plan and remain committed to implementing it as soon as practical. As we also said in January, we will add 2,000 to 3,000 new jobs in new high-growth areas over the next 18 months. The vast majority of these will be US workers, but we are also committed to hiring the best employees from around the world. So we will continue our Visa program, albeit at a lower rate, with overall applications for H1B Visas down from 20% and new hire Visas down 40%.
Cash maximization will continue to be a focus area in fiscal year 2010, given our view of the economy. We are fortunate to have a business model that is exceptionally strong in cash generation. Despite the turbulent economic conditions, we are generating net cash flow from operations at an annualized rate of approximately $20 billion. We expect free cash flow to continue to exceed operating income, and this will be assisted by significantly lower CapEx spending in fiscal year 2010. Capital expenditures are expected to decrease from the $3.1 billion I mentioned earlier this fiscal year to approximately $2 billion next year.
We are very vigilant on customer credit issues and to date have had an extremely good collection experience. Finally, we remain committed on returning capital to shareholders, and while stock repurchases will vary from quarter to quarter, we remain a net purchaser of stock over the long-term and a committed payer of dividends.
So in summary, it was a tough quarter, but I'm pleased with the organization's response by managing costs and executing on our product portfolio. Over the next 18 months, we were bringing a large wave of products and services to market, and as such, while on the short-term, our results will be impacted by the current economic conditions, we believe the long-term outlook for technology and our relative position remains very strong.
So with those comments, what I am going to do is hand it back to Bill and very happy to take your questions.
Bill Koefoed

(Operator instructions) And our first question comes from Heather Bellini with UBS.
Heather Bellini – UBS
Hi. Good afternoon guys. Chris, just to follow up on your COGS comment before, you said – I believe you said we should expect to see continued growth given the deals signed in fiscal year 2009 ramp. I'm just trying to get a sense, should we expect the – I mean gross margins I think were a little bit disappointing to people this quarter. I thought that was an area where Steve mentioned at the event that you could actually expect to get a little bit of an improvement there. So…
Chris Liddell
Yes, Heather. We are – relative to Steve's comment, we are looking for opportunities to make efficiency savings in that area, and in fact we have got a task force looking at that over the next quarter. Having said that, that efficiency is against a generally increasing trend as the mix of business shifts in that direction. So we have clearly been making some fairly significant investments in our data center, infrastructure, as we shift to a more online business and more software services. So that will start to flow through in terms of depreciation. And we will also be making some distribution transactions we've announced. So you'll start to see the costs…
Heather Bellini – UBS
So it is going to start growing faster than – it is going to be growing still faster than sales?
Chris Liddell
Yes. I would think in particular in this environment because we're going to see a relatively subdued environment certainly for the first half of the fiscal year. So yes, you can assume that is the case.
Heather Bellini – UBS
Okay, thank you.
Bill Koefoed
Thanks Heather. Operator, next question?

And next is Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley.
Adam Holt – Morgan Stanley
Good afternoon. I had a question about the client commentary heading into the fourth quarter. I believe you mentioned that we should expect units and revenue to be in line maybe with revenue a little bit below unit. And I guess I was wondering, given that the delta in this quarter between licensing and units being pretty wide, should we expect to see that similar kind of delta as average selling prices are under pressure, do you expect that to close as we get into the quarter? And then just as we look a little bit further towards Window 7, what would you expect to see with the commercial and retail licensing business as we get a little bit closer to the release? I would think it would probably drop off. Thanks.
Chris Liddell
Yes. Thanks Adam. Good point. In quarter four, I would say you're going to see broadly the same trends as we saw in Q3. I mean the introduction of netbooks makes it difficult for us to do our normal walk-through of units and revenue, but the rule of thumb that we gave you last quarter is, if you look at the non-netbooks growth, or in this case decline, that would broadly approximate the revenue in the client business. So the negatives we're seeing on our ASP will be made up for the positives that we get from netbooks growth.
I think that's a reasonable rule of thumb going forward, the same sort of trends we will see in terms of lower ASPs, netbook growth you can expect to see. The only thing that you I think we will see in the fourth quarter, that is probably slightly different from the third quarter, is a continued pressure on the business segment, which is the Pro, which is their highest revenue generator. So we might see a little bit of a gap there. And also in the finished goods area, which you asked about for fiscal year 2010, will just start with the fourth quarter. I think that will be a tough comparable because we had a good very good performance in the fourth quarter of last year. So that might be a – that my drag the overall growth rate down, attach as well. Going into next year then the finished goods area, in particular, FPP in the second half of the year when we start to see the Windows 7 impact, that will start to look more favorable. So we're going to see a declining trend for a while, improving as we get to the back end of next fiscal year.
Bill Koefoed
Thanks Adam.
Adam Holt – Morgan Stanley

Next is Brad Reback with Oppenheimer.
Brad Reback – Oppenheimer
Hi guys. How are you?
Chris Liddell
Good, thank you.
Brad Reback – Oppenheimer
Chris, you had talked about annuity rates, renewal rates being pretty stable over the course of the quarter and the expectation that they remain that way. Could you give us any sense of what pricing trends look like and what you might expect them to be for the remainder of the fiscal year?
Chris Liddell
Yes. The first comment I will make is that the third quarter was a relatively quiet quarter for us, fourth quarter is a very big quarter. So this will be an important quarter for us in terms of renewals and that will feed through what happens in fiscal year 2010. The experience to date is that we have seen no – what we discovered is no unnatural discounting. We've certainly seen customers being very price conscious, but to date our renewals have been broadly in line with the revenue that is falling off from previous contracts being revenue renewed at about the same rate.
Now what we're losing is perhaps some of the upside that we saw in previous years, so typically when we renew a contract, we take the opportunity to up sales, put some of the new products into the mix. Hopefully for most customers, we are seeing them with more seats at the end of three years than they started that with, more employees. Clearly that trend is more difficult, so we're seeing customers with the same or even less employees than where they were three years ago. And while we should be offering them new products, we might be losing some, picking up something from the new products, so overall awash.
The general sort of environment that we're seeing is good renewal rates, no unnatural price discounting, but we have lost some of the upside, so therefore our renewals and our billing is sort of trending down to low single digits from the sort of mid double digits that we are experiencing in the last years. So still overall what I would describe particularly in this environment as very healthy, but not sort of double digit rates we would have loved to have seen.
Brad Reback – Oppenheimer
Great, thanks.

And next is Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.
Phil Winslow – Credit Suisse
Hi guys. Just wanted to dig into cost of goods sold just a little bit for the count down next year, just wondering if you can give us a sense of quarter to quarter there, just what your expectations are? And that is it.
Chris Liddell
Yes sure. We're not giving out guidance on cost of goods sold. We will certainly give you some more color in July. But if you see the trends that have been happening in the last few quarters and extrapolate those, you can expect that to continue. Now you have to look a little bit deep into the underlying trend. So for example we have hardware cost of goods sold, they tend to move very much with Xbox sales, so that is one dynamic. Then you have the online cost of goods sold and that tending to go up as we depreciate some of the infrastructure we have put in that tends to follow the capital expenditure that we have been talking about over the last couple of years. And then you have got sort of general cost of goods sold and things like distribution deals which is starting to ramp up with the announcements that we have made over the last few months. So if we take these three trends and combine them together and extrapolate them, you get some sense of what fiscal year 2010 will look like.
Phil Winslow – Credit Suisse
Thanks.

Operator
Next is Brendan Barnicle with Pacific crest.
Brendan Barnicle – Pacific Crest
Thanks so much. Chris, as you start to think about Windows 7 and how that may be released and we start to think about modeling that, should we look at that to have the same sort of tech guarantee program that we had with Vista and as a result that same impact on deferred revenue, or would there be any change, maybe more like was done in earlier OS releases?
Chris Liddell
Yes. We obviously haven't finalized all of those details. It is not unreasonable to assume that we would do a tech guarantee at some stage, but the exact timing of that will depend on clearly the release time of the product itself, and that could cause some inter-quarter accounting recognition issues, but not a significant issue. Obviously it will washout over the course of the year. So yes, you can assume that from a modeling point of view. I you're looking over the long-term, it won't have any impact.
Brendan Barnicle – Pacific Crest
Might it be – see its effect in the shorter period than we saw with Vista?
Chris Liddell
Too early to tell. I think that a similar period is how I would assume.
Brendan Barnicle – Pacific Crest
Okay great. Thank you.
Bill Koefoed
Operator, next question?
Operator
Next is Sarah Friar from Goldman Sachs.
Sarah Friar – Goldman Sachs
Good afternoon. Chris, if I could just take you back more to kind of a macro view, feel like you have given us more color than last quarter. Is there anything in the linearity of the quarter that made you feel a little bit better as you got towards the end of March? And in particular, if I kind of think of even just the guidance you have given us, you have clearly given us a lot more color this time around than you give us back in January. But it feels like you're signaling that maybe you still have your arms around it better, is that fair or unfair way to think about it?
Chris Liddell
A couple of comments. Firstly, this is the quarter we typically start to talk about fiscal year 2010, so I'm giving you a little bit more color, because I'm trying to give you some sense of the fiscal year the next year as opposed to what is just happening for the next quarter, so you are picking up that. The second, in terms of linearity, I guess (inaudible) learning things like second derivative, and what they mean. How do I feel about the shape of the quarter? I don't see any improvement at the end of the quarter that gives me encouragement that we are at the bottom and coming out of it. I think – I would like to think that trading conditions will not get any worse than where they were in the third quarter, but hopefully my commentary gives you some sense that we expect them to continue in the fourth quarter and second half of the year, a little bit early to tell, but probably continue to be tough as well. So if you like, during the quarter, they stopped getting worse, but that is different from they started getting better.
Sarah Friar – Goldman Sachs
Sure.
Chris Liddell
And I think that's a safe assumption for the fourth quarter.
Sarah Friar – Goldman Sachs
And US versus Europe, just the two very major geographies, any particular differences between the two?
Chris Liddell
Not between US and Europe, Western Europe anyway. Eastern Europe very weak, places like Russia, particularly weak. Japan, very weak; Brazil, very weak. So some of the areas where a year ago we were talking about extremely good growth rates, countries like Russia, particularly had extremely good growth rates a year ago, have gone the other way. So the US and Western Europe, very similar picture, weak, but not significantly. When you go into Eastern Europe and emerging markets, the picture is generally worse.
Sarah Friar – Goldman Sachs
Okay, thank you.

And next is John DiFucci with JP Morgan.
John DiFucci – JP Morgan
Thank you. Chris, last quarter you said that clients saw 2% headwind because the channel inventories were below normal levels, and it looks like the OEM license G&A growth was about 2% better than PC unit growth. I'm just curious is that all – is that all inventory making up for the inventory of last channel, and where is the industry today, or is there something else happening there also?
Chris Liddell
It is a combination of factors. Inventory is one of them; attach rates were actually quite good in the quarter, so not only because of the netbooks impact. We have an exceptionally high netbooks attach now, about 90%, I believe. But we also saw good attach in the non netbook segment as well, so there's a few variables moving there, inventory being one of them, I think was a slight negative, to be honest, inventory but attach rate was particularly positive, and that led the impact that you are seeing.
Bill Koefoed
Operator?
Chris Liddell
Sorry? Yes.
John DiFucci – JP Morgan
So the – just to be clear there, so inventory has the 2% headwind last quarter and you saw another small headwind again this quarter as inventory levels actually got a little lower?
Chris Liddell
Correct.
John DiFucci – JP Morgan
Okay, thanks Chris.
Bill Koefoed
Operator, next question?

And next is Brent Thill with Citigroup.
Brent Thill – Citigroup
Chris, your expense controls are significantly ahead of your plan you just gave just two months ago. How do you think about the next phase of expense control, and I know you mentioned you are not going to give 2010 guidance? But I think the way you guys mentioned, to think about it is that would be flat in 2009 with 2010, so I think we are assuming that that number that you have given us now is flat for 2010? Can you just help us clarify if there is anything else that you plan to spend ahead of some of these major launches that would change that trajectory that you just give us two months ago?
Chris Liddell
Let me give you a bit of overall context about how I think about the savings in general and then I can answer your question specifically. I think you've probably heard me say that in this company and in the previous companies I've worked, I've always felt that the best cost savings programs are ones that are a combination of, I describe, a top-down and bottom-up. Top-down being basically, we're going to cut headcount by X, we're going to cut travel expenditure by Y, and these are the new rules.
The bottom-up is how then employees actually apply those rules to how they run the business. Now when I give you the numbers a couple of months, three months ago effectively, for this year, that was the sum total of our top-down initiatives. So if employees implemented them exactly how – implemented the rules exactly how we told them, effectively you would have had that number. The fact that we have been able to achieve operating expense savings in excess of that is really a credit to people implementing in an even more extreme fashion.
So they have even traveled even less than what we have asked them to, they have taken – been doing cost savings even more than what we have asked them, and we have ramped headcount even slower than what we were anticipating. So I don't bank the bottom-up on a continual basis. I only bank what I describe as the top-down, so my starting position for fiscal year 2010 remains where it was, in dollar terms, a quarter ago.
Having said that, if we get a cultural change and employees continue to have fiscal responsibility and implement the rules in a very efficient fashion, then we could see a lower number. So I'm not going to promise that to you this quarter. There will be part of what we do in the budgeting round, but I would be starting next year with the number I gave last quarter, and hopefully we can beat that when we talk to you about it in three months time.
Brent Thill – Citigroup
Thanks Chris.
Bill Koefoed
Operator, next question?
Operator
And next is Tim Klasell with Thomas Weisel Partners.
Tim Klasell – Thomas Weisel Partners
Yes, good afternoon everybody. Just wanted to go over to the Microsoft business division where you said on Office you had a higher tax rate but lower ASPs and lower units. Is that lower unit – excuse me, lower ASP and higher tax rate going to be something you want to do prominently, i.e. if units begin to pick back up, we can model it like that, or do you think we might see the ASPs begin to increase after the release of the next version or if the economy gets better?
Chris Liddell
There was two impacts last quarter that hit ASP and what (inaudible) talked about how you expect them going forward. The first was that we just had a price decrease. We took the opportunity to have a special price. We will – and that certainly we got a volume pickup as a result of that but a lower ASP. You won't see that as a permanent basis, that was something that we did for a quarter or so. That was one thing.
The second was that we generally saw a continued buying activity in the lower price points and less buying activity in the high price points because of the worse business PC growth. So if you like, you saw a mix change to a lower SKU. Again that is really going to be driven in the future by not our action, but by how PCs, business PCs recovered through next year. I think it is going to continue to be relatively weak for the foreseeable future, and I think I foreshadowed that in my overall comment. Going into the releases the next calendar year, I would like to think that business PC demand is hopefully going to be picking back up by then, plus we'll have the new release. So you'll start to see that trend come back the other way, but it is going to be some time.
Tim Klasell – Thomas Weisel Partners
Okay great. Thank you.

And next is Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.
Kash Rangan – Banc of America Securities/Merrill Lynch
Hi, thank you very much. Chris, you made a comment earlier that you are looking forward to launching a counter cyclical wave of products in the next 18 to 24 months. I was wondering if you could expand upon that and also talk about, to the extent that you can on a quarterly earnings conference call, what kind of changes we should anticipate to the business model (inaudible) associated with that? Thanks.
Chris Liddell
Sure. I mean – it is difficult launching a massive wave of products into a weakening demand, so that is what I've described as the counter cyclical. But when you look across virtually all of our businesses, there is going to be a major release of some form of them in the next year, the most obvious is Windows 7 clearly which has been well foreshadowed. Office will be coming out with a new version, Exchange will be coming out with a new version. We have got potentially a new search product coming out in the foreseeable future. So you will see, in all of our major products, a significant release in the next let's say 12 months.
Now that is going to be into a soft demand environment potentially, but we think that is really the right thing to do. And clearly that is an investment that is driven around our product development portfolio, not the economic cycle. But once we start to get economic pickup, we think that we will outperform that economic pickup. So the moment it is really about the surviving the economic reset, going into a growth period, which we like to think is going to be around the corner at some stage. We will actually be going into that growth pickup with a very, very good set of new products, and so the environment, one to two years out, starts to look much more interesting.
Kash Rangan – Banc of America Securities/Merrill Lynch
And also Chris, the business model changes associated with that product rollout?
Chris Liddell
Well, the ones that I meant, and why it would be a significant business model are the ones that you will see, the Windows Azure also will be generally released over that period. So that will start to change the business model. You'll start to see more online driven version of some of our key products, so that will start to change the business model. But the revenue impacts of that are going to be relatively modest, certainly in fiscal year 2010. That is more of a fiscal year 2011 and 2012 impact in terms of significance.

Robert Breza – RBC Capital Markets
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Chris, just a follow up to Sarah's question about the geographic weakness that you mentioned in some of those countries, are you specifically talking about the transaction business, the annuity business or both, kind of follow up on that? Thanks.
Chris Liddell
Yes, I tend to look at the transactional business because it is probably more of an indicator of the instantaneous economic activity in that particular country, although the blended rate is also the same basic trend. But my comments were in particular around transactional. So you tend to obviously see in countries like Russia, it is more driven around transactional anyway. There isn't a strong enterprise agreement driven part of that economy yet. So the transactional tends to be a higher component and particularly when [ph] I was mentioning countries, I was thinking about that.
Bill Koefoed
Operator, let us take one more question.
Operator
And our last question comes from Katherine Egbert with Jefferies.
Katherine Egbert – Jefferies
Thanks. Chris, you didn't repurchase any stock this quarter. Can you talk about that, you approach to capital? I mean is this environment driven or is there another reason? Thanks.
Chris Liddell
It is generally environmental. I put that – foreshadowed that at the last call that we would be generally more cautious in this current environment in terms of building our cash reserves. I am happy on the flip side to lower share repurchases. We have built cash and investments back over $25 billion. So we have purchased back around $9 billion of stock this fiscal year and paid out around $3 billion of dividends. So we have returned about $12 billion.
Going forward, as I think I have said consistently, we still will be a net purchaser of our shares. We are still committed to paying dividends. So we are still committed to repaying cash as much as possible, but it is going to vary quarter by quarter, and is going depend enormously on the environment we find ourselves in, and things like our working capital management as well.
But overall one of the great positives of the company, which I mentioned briefly in my prepared remarks, is just the overall cash flow. We are generating free cash flow at around $20 billion annualized rate, which is tremendous in this environment. So there is no reason to suspect that over the medium to long-term we won't continue to be net buyers of our shares.
Katherine Egbert – Jefferies
Okay, very good. Thank you.

Welcome to the Microsoft fiscal year 2009 second quarter earnings call. Today’s call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Koefoed, General Manager, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Bill Koefoed
Thank you, operator, and thanks everyone for joining us a little earlier than normal today for Microsoft’s second quarter 2009 earnings conference call. We decided to align the timing of the earnings release this quarter with the cost management initiatives that we announced this morning. We will talk further about these initiatives later on the call.
I am delighted today to be joined by Steve Ballmer, our Chief Executive Officer, as well as Chris Liddell, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Corporate Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel. The format for today’s call will be as follows.
Chris will summarize some of the key take-aways for the quarter, as well as address the announcement we made this morning. I’ll then provide details around our second quarter results and then hand it back to Chris for a more detailed discussion of our business outlook, and then Steve will make some comments. After that, we’ll take some questions.
Please be aware that we filed our Form 10-Q today in conjunction with our earnings release. We have also posted our quarterly financial summary slide deck, which is intended to follow the flow of our prepared remarks, as well as provide a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures that we will talk about today. You can find these documents on the Investor Relations website at www.microsoft.com/msft.
Today’s call will be webcast live and recorded. Please be aware that if you decide to ask a question, it will be included in both our live transmission as well as any future use of the recording. A replay of the call will be available at the Microsoft Investor Relations web site through the close of business on January 22, 2010. This conference call report is protected by copyright law and international treaties. Unauthorized reproduction or distribution of this report or any portion of it without the express permission of Microsoft may result in civil and criminal penalties.
We will be making statements during this call that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in today’s earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the risk factors section of our Form 10-Q, our most recent Form 10-K, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.
And now, I’ll return the call over to Chris.
Chris Liddell
Thanks, Bill, and again thanks to all of you for accommodating our timing changes. Our second-quarter results reflect a difficult environment as the global economy continued to deteriorate beyond our expectations, particularly during the month of December. Despite this economic backdrop, we were able to grow revenue and utilize accelerated cost reductions to offset the majority of the impact of the revenue shortfall on operating income.
On a segment basis, our client business, being the most severely impacted by the softening economy, declining 8% due to the significant weakness in the traditional PC market sales, partially offset by the rapid growth of netbooks. Revenue from Microsoft business division and server and tools divisions grew a combined $500 million or 7% driven by healthy demand from enterprise customers while the transactional aspects of these businesses were impacted by lower PC and server hardware unit sales. Our online services business revenue was flat, although online advertising revenue was up 7% in a tough environment. And entertainment and devices division delivered revenue above the high end of our guidance driven by a record number of consumers purchasing Xbox 360 consoles during the holiday season.
Against the backdrop of a deteriorating economy, we are focused on the need for fiscal discipline and on executing in the areas we can control by managing expenses while delivering on the next wave of our product pipeline. During the second quarter, as the economic outlook continued to slow, we accelerated our expense reduction plan. These actions allowed us to deliver operating expenses in the second quarter $600 million below our October forecast.
However, today we have also announced steps we will take to further manage our cost structure. These steps include a reduction in headcount related costs, including plans to reduce up to 5,000 positions in the areas of research and development, marketing, sales, finance, legal, human resources and IT over the next 18 months, of which 1,400 are effective today. There will be no pay raises next fiscal year. We have plans to significantly reduce our vendor and contingent staff expenses. We’ll also be looking for reductions in marketing expenses, reduced capital expenditure and facility costs, as well as tighter discretionary spending, including significantly reduced travel related expenses.
The cumulative result of these actions taken during the quarter and those announced today will result in operating expense savings of $1.5 billion and capital expenditure savings of $700 million lower in this fiscal year 2009 than assumed in our July guidance. Lastly, we plan to manage operating expenses broadly flat in the fiscal year 2010 and capital expenditure to be lower year over year. While we are managing our expenses tightly, we continue investing in key strategic opportunities which will fuel the future growth of the company. We have a strong product pipeline and are bringing to market a number of significant product releases over the next two calendar years.
With those high level themes, I will turn the call over to Bill for more details on the second quarter.

Thanks Chris. I will discuss top line financial and business momentum points followed by revenue performance for each of the business units. Then I’ll review the rest of the income statement. All growth comparisons relate to the comparable quarter of last year unless otherwise noted.
Revenue grew 2% to $16.6 billion, which was below our low end guidance as the economic environment weakened further than we expected, particularly in the month of December. Our mix of product billings was approximately 30% from OEMs, 25% from multi-year licensing agreements, 20% from license only sales, and the balance from our other businesses. Despite the broad economic weakness, the annuity portion of our volume licensing business remains healthy and increased one percentage point in our billing mix. Enterprise agreements renewal rates were in line with historical trends.
Unearned revenue grew over 7% to $13.1 billion but was down sequentially. Our contracted not billed balance increased 10% year over year but was slightly down on a sequential basis remaining at over $13 billion. When taken together with reported revenues, total bookings for the company declined 10% this quarter, reflecting the general economic weakness, primarily in our non-annuity business. Overall, changes in foreign exchange rates added about 1 percentage point to our revenue growth.
Now I’ll provide revenue details by business segment starting with Windows clients. Client revenue declined 8% to $4.0 billion. I will review the main drivers that contributed to this performance beginning with an overview of the PC market. We estimate that the PC market for the quarter was approximately flat year over year, well short of our forecast of 10% to 12% growth as the PC market weakened much more quickly and severely than expected. Adding a bit more color, traditional PCs declined almost 10% with weakness in both consumer and business PCs. This was partially offset by incremental growth in the new notebooks category.
During the quarter, our Windows OEM licensed units declined by 1%. OEM revenue was 12% lower year over year driven primarily by the dynamics of the underlying PC market. Specifically, the decline in traditional PC sales drove double digit declines in business and consumer premium SKUs. This impact was partially offset by strong growth in our notebooks offering. Our attach rates were under pressure during the quarter, but we didn’t experience a material change versus historical rate. Our notebook attach rate now exceed 80% as customers are clearly opting for the value Windows provides.
We estimate that we lost about two percentage points of growth due to the channel holding lower than historical level of inventory. The commercial and retail portion of the client business grew 19% as it benefited from continued adoption of Windows Vista in the enterprise.
On the product front, our engineering team reached a major milestone with the delivery of the public beta of Windows 7, which has received great reviews to-date. We remain very positive about the client product pipeline and its ability to drive long-term growth. Server and tools revenue grew 15% to $3.7 billion despite a declining server hardware market. This achievement marks the business' 26th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.
Annuity licensing continued to grow faster than non annuity licensing. The momentum of SQL Server 2008 and our Hyper-V virtualization helped drive Windows server sales and increase our systems center management tools attach rate, thus allowing us to grow our revenue per server. As a result, server and tools continued to grow faster than the hardware market.
Demand for our consulting and support services to deploy Microsoft technology remained strong, driving revenue growth at 16%. On the product side, the server and tools division made significant product development progress. Released to beta, Windows Server 2008 R2 will add the Live migration feature to Hyper-V, further enhancing our virtualization offering.
At the Professional Developers Conference in October, we provided a preview to Windows Azure, our cloud based services platform. The Azure services platform hosted in Microsoft data centers provides an operating system and a set of developer services that can be used to build new applications to run from the cloud or enhance existing applications with cloud based capabilities. This architecture gives developers the choice to build web applications, applications running on connected devices, PCs, servers or hybrid solutions, while using the same tools they use today.
The online services business revenue was relatively flat at $866 million. Online advertising revenue grew 7%. Search revenue grew double digits while display revenue grew slower in a weak ad spending market. We continue to see healthy growth in our traffic with page views and query searches both up on a sequential and year over year basis. In the online services business, we recently announced important partnerships with Dell, Verizon, and Sun Microsystems, and released a new suite of Windows Live services. We remain committed to the benefit that a strong online services business will bring to Microsoft.
Microsoft business division revenue was up 1% to $4.9 billion. Business revenue grew 7%, driven by continued strength of the annuity business across Office, SharePoint and Client Access licenses suites, and benefited from strong deferred revenue recognition. Non annuity revenue declined on weakness in the mid market, small medium business and consumer segments. Specifically consumer revenue declined 23% driven by the weakness in the core PC market, a mix shift to lower price SKUs and inventory reductions from Q1. From a product perspective, SharePoint, Office Communication Server and CRM, all grew at double-digit rates. We made significant progress against the product pipeline by releasing final versions of Exchange Online and SharePoint Online.
In October at PDC, we demonstrated our Office 14 Web applications, which will enable the rich and familiar office experiences through the browser. Entertainment and devices division revenue grew 3% to $3.2 billion, a record 6 million consoles were sold in the quarter growing over 41%. In Europe, Xbox 360 sales nearly doubled those of previous holiday season. Based on US NPD numbers released last week, Xbox 360 outsold PS3 two one.
We continue to lead the industry with our software attach ratio of 8.1. During the quarter, we also launched the new Xbox Experience, which has been received extremely well. This software update has given our customers a new upgraded experience that broadens its appeal and increases the value and durability of the platform to customers and Microsoft. Xbox Live membership has grown 70% from last year to 17 million members.
Now, for the rest of the income statement. Cost of goods sold was $3.9 billion, increasing as a percentage of revenue two percentage points to 23.5%. Cost of goods sold growth was driven by higher Xbox 360 console volumes, increased data center and traffic acquisition cost in the online services business and growth in enterprise services.
Operating expenses were $6.8 billion, over $600 million less than was assumed in our low end guidance. This represents a significant slowing in the operating expense growth rate. Savings included marketing, vendor, people and general and administrative expenses. As a consequence, operating income, which was $5.9 billion was only $174 million below guidance despite revenue being $712 million below guidance. Other income and expenses was a loss of approximately $300 million for the quarter, driven by currency evaluation declines on unhedged portions of the balance sheet and investment impairments, offset by dividends, interest and net recognized gains on investments sold.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, half a percentage point lower than guidance, driven by an earnings mix increase in lower tax jurisdictions. During the quarter, we repurchased 94 million shares or over $2.2 billion of company stock. We also paid out about $1.2 billion in dividend to shareholders. Diluted shares outstanding were 8.9 billion, down 6.2% from the prior year as a result of the share repurchases. Earnings per share were $0.47 representing a decline of 6%.
As Chris noted earlier, the business environment made for a challenging quarter, but we feel positively about our quick response in managing expenses to mitigate the impact as much as possible. With that, let me turn it back to Chris, who will provide you with more insight into our business outlook.
Chris Liddell
I am going to spend my remaining time talking about the balance of fiscal 2009. Clearly, the volatility in the macro economic climate created a great degree of uncertainty in the second half of our fiscal year. And in particular conditions progressively worsened throughout the second quarter, creating a broader the normal range of possible extrapolations looking forward. So given that we expect macroeconomic conditions to be the most important variable in predicting our results in the second half, we’re not providing quantitative revenue or earnings per share guidance at this time.
We will however provide you with a framework to help you think about the drivers for our business. I’ll start with revenue, beginning with clients. The PC market is clearly the key driver of client revenue and it is likely to remain weak over the second half of our fiscal year, with market trends similar to or potentially weaker than the second quarter, especially in the traditional PC market, excluding the Xbox. Offsetting that partially, the netbooks mix of total PCs will likely follow similar trends to Q2, with continued strong Windows attach on netbooks contributing to overall Windows revenue. However, as the economy slows, continued inventory contraction and pressure on tax rate would negatively impact revenue growth in the second half. So overall, we expect client revenue to perform broadly in line with the traditional PC market.
For the Microsoft business division, I will speak to the three main drivers for the business. Consumer revenue, which makes up about 20% of the divisional revenue, will be impacted by the declines of the traditional or non netbook PC market, in addition to further channel inventory contraction. Transactional licensing sales to business customers which make up about 25% of the divisional revenue should generally align to the business PC hardware markets which may continue to decline in the second half. Finally, the remaining annuity licensing portion of MBD revenue which makes up approximately 55% is likely to remain somewhat insulated from macro trends and grow faster than IT spending due to the strength of the businesses like SharePoint and unified communications, although it could face pressure due to lengthening sales cycles.
The server and tools segment has many of the same drivers as the business division. The OEM and transactional licensing to business customers, which is approximately 35% of the business, should generally align for the server hardware market which at this time of the year [ph] and we expect will decline over the second half of the year. The remaining annuity licensing and enterprise services portion of the business will likely continue to grow faster than IT spending based on the strength of our product portfolio and business model but also could face some pressure due to lengthening sales cycle.
Overseas revenue should followed similar trends to what was experienced in the second quarter, as advertising spending will likely remain weak until the economy starts turning. This is particularly true for the display advertising portion of our business where we expect monetization rates across the industry to continue to worsen. Also keep in mind that ongoing expected declines is our XS business will weigh on the overall growth of the segment. Additionally, we would expect a headwind from the impact of foreign currency in the second half of the year, given the high proportion of revenue that comes from international markets.
The entertainment and devices division is highly dependent on consumer spending and while we feel good about the first half results, a shrinking consumer spending environment would weigh on the segment's results in the second half. Console revenue will likely decline as a result of our earlier pricing actions. Attach revenue may also slow due to contracting consumer spending and moderating attach rates. The other software and peripherals portions of our business followed the underlying PC market in the second half.
With that primarily to assist [ph] our revenue prospects, let me move to our outlook on expenses. The economy has clearly deteriorated more than we expected and we have responded to this environment by taking further actions to reduce expenses and to prioritize our efforts. We have initiated a number of cost savings which will layer in progressively over this fiscal year. As a result of these actions, we now expect fiscal 2009 operating expenses of approximately $27.4 billion. Going forward, we expect to maintain our operating expenses broadly flat in fiscal year 2010.
Moving to the other drivers of earnings per share, we continue to experience – we continue to expect an effective tax rate of 26.5% for the year. Other income may be negatively affected by further market movements. We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders through stock repurchases over the long-term. However, given the increased uncertainty in the current market, our repurchase activity will slow in the second half of fiscal year 2009.
With those overall comments and outlook, I would now like to hand the call over to Steve, so he can share his perspectives before we take your questions.
Steve Ballmer
Thanks Chris. We are certainly in the midst of a once-in-a-lifetime set of economic conditions. The perspective I would bring is not one of recession, what I would say rather is the economy is resetting to a lower level of business and consumer spending that is based largely on the reduced leveraged in the economy. Consumers cannot refinance their homes, don’t have that extra money to buy discretionary second and third PCs. In the business market, we certainly see a production in capital expense based upon lack of leverage in business conditions. IT spending represents about 50% of US business capital spend. And so neither the consumer nor the business side of the technology industry is immune to these economic conditions. As a participant in the market that at least in some areas like our client business has a very significant market share, you certainly feel the overall market impact most clearly.
In these times, I think there is three things to focus in on, and not surprisingly two of them are very similar to things we focus in on everyday. The three things are, number one, innovation, which I will talk about. Number two is market share, because even in a market that is suffering, share increases drive revenue growth. We are always focused on share but particularly now. And number three is efficiency and effective resource prioritization and allocation, which is where I want to start and one where perhaps we spent a little less time with you historically.
We are long-term and I’ll come back to this. We remain incredibly positive on Microsoft, the technology industry, the opportunity for innovation, and yet now it’s certainly the time to ask critically which of our investments should we prioritize and how can we get more efficient, get the same amount of work done, if you will, for less. We have been, through an exercise and continue through an exercise, looking at work processes and driving for efficiency, rightsizing and prioritizing some of our investments. And we've had to take a number of actions, we are taking a number of actions and in some sense manage our cost base.
Our cost base has grown, as many of you know, significantly over the last few years. And while as Chris said, we don’t plan on shrinking it in FY '10, we are really putting the brakes on at a new level and quite significantly putting the brakes on. With that said, we’re going to continue to invest in important areas of opportunity for the company and so even while we take out up to 5000 jobs, we will also be adding a few thousand jobs back in the areas like search, where we continue to see incredible opportunity to do good work. So, we will take out, put back in, but in aggregate manage expenses consistent with the comments Chris had a chance to make.
In terms of market share, I think we have some great opportunity. Bill talked about the performance of Xbox, sold over 5 million Windows mobile units this quarter, which was great, we got a lot of opportunity in search and we are glad to have search volume up so significantly for us this quarter. Our server and tools business reflects our ongoing market share improvements basically in both Windows Server and in our SQL business. You’ll see us continue to invest particularly in Web Servers and technical computing as we move forward.
In the client business, we sold north of 50 million units of Windows and had another big chunk. Unfortunately probably got used without pay, but not paid for, and yet we lost maybe a point of share as Apple sold 2.5 million Macs during the same period. We have big plans there with Windows 7 and everything that we have coming forward. And certainly in this economic climate, the kind of price premiums that people pay for Macintoshes versus PCs I think will be looked at farmer critically by customers as a number of reviewers have started to note. In the case of netbooks, we have gone from no share to, as the guys said, over 80% share and climbing. It is a whole interesting topic in and of itself.
Our office business with the consumer market, unit volumes are up dramatically year-on-year, over 14%, which is a business people think where we have high share and we have great opportunity. So a lot of focus in the enterprise space, in the online space, in the entertainment area, in the client area. There are a lot of opportunities to work on market share, both from a product development standpoint and from a sales and marketing perspective.
Our product pipeline and the work we are doing in innovation, I am excited about. We have had first looks on Windows 7, we had good market reaction to Windows Azure, a new version of Office, Office 14. I am excited to be out in the next year or so. Windows Server 2008 Release 2 builds on the strength of Windows Server. We have certainly got our work cut out for us. There are businesses where we got a lot of work to do, where we don’t have leading positions, and there is some businesses where we’ve got leading positions, which have phenomenal new products to come. But we will continue to invest strongly in R&D, that gets very well funded in the operating expense strategy that Chris talked about, but at the same time, we are prioritizing, we are focusing on the most important stuff as we go forward.
Certainly while the size and scope of this economic dislocation is unprecedented and may delay some technology adoption in the industry at large, I don’t think there is any stopping the forward march of our industry or of Microsoft. And in the long run, let us call it the pause that the economy is imposing on our industry will certainly just be that, it is a pause and there will be renewed strong growth in the technology industry overall and certainly at Microsoft. And we’re focused, we are focused on efficiency, on market share, and on renovation as we drive forward.
And with that, I am going to hand things back over to Bill so we can start taking some of your questions.
Bill Koefoed
Thanks Steve. Let’s now proceed to questions. We want to accommodate questions from as many people as possible, so please avoid multipart questions and I will strictly limit you to just one question. Operator, will you please repeat your instructions?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator instructions). And our first question comes from Brent Thill with Citigroup.
Brent Thill – Citigroup
Thanks. Good morning. If your fiscal 2009 guidance holds, this will be the fourth consecutive year of operating margin decline. Do you think you're taking quick enough action to realign the business to this lower demand environment?
Chris Liddell
Yes, Brent, we believe certainly taking as you saw $600 million worth of costs out in the second quarter, which is almost 10% of our cost base for the quarter, was very prompt action. And if you look at $1.5 billion for this year as well, that we believe in the context of a deteriorating economic that really accelerated in December, so we're talking about reacting to the last in particular month to six weeks or so of economic data. We think the actions we took were actually quite very fast and appropriate for that now. I agree with the margin comment, but clearly also the mix of our business is changing quite significantly as well. So as we sit here today, based on the facts that we have seen in particular over the last few weeks, we think we have taken the right degree of action in terms of reducing the cost base but continuing to still invest against the revenue that we see coming forward.
Steve Ballmer
I think one thing you have to understand is with our margin structure i.e. with high margins as a percentage of revenue, we're going to be far more volatile both on the upside and on the downside due to fluctuations in revenue. And unlike a company that is sort of more about manufacturing where everything kind of scales with volume, we have a much larger fixed costs chunk. And on the upside, when revenue goes strong, it’s a chance to increase margins, but when revenue is weaker, it is likely that margin percentages will decline.
Chris Liddell

And when you look at the initiatives we have taken, depending on the item you are talking about, whether it's from people to things like travel expenses to vendor cost, we're taking out somewhere between 5% and 15% of the cost line that we’re talking about, which we think in this environment relative to the reset in the economy is broadly the right level.
Bill Koefoed

Thanks. Next question?
Operator

And the next question comes from Heather Bellini with UBS.
Heather Bellini – UBS

Hi, good morning. You mentioned that you are laying off 5,000 people. I'm wondering if all of those are Microsoft employees, or there are also outside contractors that work at Microsoft that you're not including in that total? And I guess along that line, are you including cash severance charges that you are going to take for the reductions in force, are you including that in your operating expense guidance for fiscal year 2009? Thank you.
Chris Liddell

Yes, Heather. The outside contractors are not included in that number, and we will be certainly looking to reduce that cost line, probably in proportion by more than what we are talking about in terms of internal people. So the 5,000 jobs we talk about are entirely Microsoft related.
Steve Ballmer

It is not really five – I mean let me make sure the math is clear. We may eliminate up to 5,000 jobs, but we are also adding a few thousand jobs.
Heather Bellini – UBS

Yes. No, I think we all assumed that, that net-net it is going to be less than 5,000.
Steve Ballmer

And we're talking here now primarily about operating expense head count as opposed to cost of goods, which varies in its own criteria. So on the operating expense line, I expect this to been down more like a net sort of 2,000 to 3,000.
Heather Bellini – UBS

Right. Then to Chris’ point, it looks like you will end up cutting more outside contractors than the 5,000, or than the 2,000 to 3,000 you just mentioned?
Chris Liddell

Yes, those numbers are all internal people, Heather. The external contractors I guess if we think about more in terms of the dollars that we spend overall, that's on top of the numbers that we are talking about and that could be down up to 15%.
Heather Bellini – UBS

Okay. And then the cash severance charge part?
Chris Liddell

The cash severance charge is not included in the operating expense that we are talking about. It will not – we are looking at the number and it obviously depends on the final number that we talk about with people, but we will call that out separately in the third quarter for the 1,400 people that we are talking about today, and then I guess that as other people leave the company, we will look at the charge at that time.
Heather Bellini – UBS

Okay, thank you.

Bill Koefoed

Let's go to the next question please.

Operator

Next is Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley.
Adam Holt – Morgan Stanley

Good morning. My first question is about the buyback, is the slowing of buyback activity principally related to just capital preservation, or do you see an opportunity to maybe be more aggressive on the M&A side given some of the depressed valuations? And then just secondarily can you walk us through maybe even some high-level thoughts on how you view the PC market? I know you are not giving explicit guidance, but what your expectations are for piracy, any just kind of guidelines for how we should be thinking about PC growth in the back half of the year? Thanks.
Chris Liddell

Sure. On the buyback, it is both the factors that you mentioned. Certainly capital preservation in this environment is more important than it's ever been. On the acquisition side, clearly the opportunity to buy shares is very good. And Microsoft, having said that, the opportunity to buy other companies has probably never been better relative to their prices. Having said that, I wouldn't expect M&A activity to be particularly significant in the second half of the year, simply because I don't think the market generally has yet lowered their expectations to the new level of prices we're talking about. So we will continue to buy some small medium-sized businesses as we normally do. Prices are certainly coming down and that's an opportunity from our point of view, but I think the level of activity will be relatively low, certainly in the next quarter or two. But the opportunity there afterwards to buy companies, again generally speaking the small and medium sized, I think is going to be very good and that's part of thinking about why we're trying to retain that capital and retain our powder as much as possible. On the PC market, you are right, we're not giving guidance. I gave some directional thoughts. We aren’t predicting and clearly macro economic rather than Microsoft specific factors are really going to drive the PC market over the next six months. But you have so realistically the base cases for continuation or even possibly a slight deterioration from the second quarter in what we described the traditional PC market.
Steve Ballmer

It is worth remembering that the market has let me just say broadly speaking four pieces to it. Business PCs, for which we receive our highest royalty, consumer PCs, netbook, netbook PCs, and then let's just say everything in emerging markets, of which China is half of that. And I mentioned that because we have different pricing in each and we have particularly in the last one we have some high piracy dynamics, which affect us. PC market overall is probably strongest today in emerging markets, second strongest in the netbooks, third strongest in home PCs, and weakest in business PCs, because that's where – it is a place where businesses will say, we will just extend the refresh cycle. So our economic drivers don't look like overall PC market, they look like the components, and unfortunately right now we are in let’s say tough wind relative even to that mix.
Chris Liddell

And the other thing I would say, and I think this is generic to all the businesses, is we saw quite a different shape in the quarter. I mean December in particular was relatively weak inside the quarter. October trading conditions were generally speaking in line with our expectations, the first half of November was, and we like I think most companies out there saw the weakness really started to set in in late November and through December. So to some extent, at the end of the year, we extrapolate the quarter overall or the conditions that we and most companies saw in December, as to what sort of an environment we’d see in the first half, and that creates if you like the bookings of expectations, but those are quite wide. If you extrapolate the quarter overall, or extrapolate December, you get quite different answers, and that's true of the PC market, also true for business overall.
Adam Holt – Morgan Stanley

Good color, thank you.
Bill Koefoed

Let's go to the next question.
Operator

And next is Sarah Friar from Goldman Sachs.
Sarah Friar – Goldman Sachs

Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a follow up there on the PC growth rate versus Microsoft growth rate. Steve, I understand your point about your oriented away from maybe some – or you don't make as much money on some of the segments that are growing fastest. The delta we saw this quarter of about 8%, is that a reasonable delta to think about going forward, particularly you have a sense of how inventory noise was in the quarter? Does that dive back and maybe close the delta or should we keep thinking about it about an 8% delta?
Steve Ballmer

I don’t know that you can pick any magic number because the dynamic – unfortunately, the dynamics shift fairly quickly. My guess is, wherever businesses are going to reset, that will reset more quickly than where the consumer will wind up resetting to. The consumer will be more volatile. Our business customers will go through one round of thinking rethinking budgets, and then they will reset it at a new level. And so I think we are going to see more dynamism unfortunately in that number.
Chris Liddell

Yes, Sarah, if I add a little bit color for that, and there are more – as Steve says, there are more moving pieces this quarter than there are normally, but if I try and simplify it a little bit, if you take what we described as our traditional PC market, which is a mixture of the business and consumer that Steve just mentioned, and take that as one growth rate, netbooks will clearly grow in excess of that and give us a little bit of a revenue uplift. We will see probably some inventory contractions. Attach rates on average are probably going to be much the same, we might lose some in the traditional market but gain a bit on the netbooks side, and then we will see our traditional shift to emerging markets, although interestingly they have slowed more than traditional markets inside the quarter. You throw all those things together and we would expect that revenue in client to be broadly in line with the growth rate from the traditional PC market, so all the other pluses and minuses will generally speaking cancel themselves out.
Sarah Friar – Goldman Sachs

But not as big a delta as we saw this quarter?
Chris Liddell

Relative to the PC market, in fact, we saw it’s about the same. So the traditional PC market we think shrinks somewhere between 7% and 10% in the quarter and our revenue for the client business was down around 8%, so in that range. So that sort of trend based on the set of factors which Steve mentioned are moving quite quickly, but if I hold relative to the second quarter, you're probably going to see that same overall trend in the back half.
Sarah Friar – Goldman Sachs

Thank you.

Bill Koefoed

Thanks. Operator, next question?

Operator

Next is Karl Sharingan from Bank of America.
Karl Sharingan – Bank of America

Hi. Thank you very much. Steve, since we have you on the line, just thought I’d ask you a question on the headcount reduction. You pointed out that the consumer spending and business spending has contracted pretty sharply and yet we are talking about a 5,000 person headcount reduction here which still leaves the operating expenses for this fiscal 2009 up about 10% despite the revenue growth of what looks to be about a percent or so? So I'm wondering what your thoughts are, what are your assumptions? I mean it looks like you're factoring in some sort of a rebound, maybe on 12 months, 15 months? Certainly you don't want to lay-off a lot of people if you end up having to hire them back when the economy starts to turn. I'm just wondering if that's the way you are thinking about it, or are you actually open to revisiting the cost structure if indeed the economic conditions continue to act the way that you portrait, that is a vastly lower level of consumer and business spending on technology? Are you open to another round of cuts if you have to in order to bring the OpEx in line with net revenue growth that we are looking at in 2009 and 2010?
Steve Ballmer

Well, no. I would say actually a couple of things. I don't know about that. We are not used to down markets. So PC market, the traditional market, as Chris calls them, is down 7, or whatever it is, 8% or so. But 8% is vast, something that's always grown a lot. But maybe some of your attributes, I would modify slightly. We are certainly dealing with unprecedented grounds. Our model is not for a quick rebound. Our model is things go down, as I said, and they reset. The economy shrinks and then it doesn't rebound, it builds from a lower base effectively. So that kind of built in in our work on costs overall reflects that model. So no, I'm not expecting a balance. And when we did our resizing, we did our resizing with an eye both towards margin, total profit, shareholders short-term and long-term investment in the growth opportunities that we see. So no, I would say that if the economy stays down and then builds slowly, we're probably at about the expense base, we will stay at about the expense base that Chris talked about. You can't tell, the economy could also get a whole lot worse, it could get a whole lot better, but our basic view is that things go down, they are down for a while, a year or two years, I don't know what it will be, and then start to build back again. That's kind of the basic planning model behind this resizing of our cost base. You could say that means you could see lower total profit percent margin and that's certainly possible.
Bill Koefoed

Next question.
Operator

And next is Philip Winslow from Credit Suisse.
Philip Winslow – Credit Suisse

Hi, guys. I just wanted to dig into the severance charges for a minute, you mentioned that you are clearing those in your GAAP OpEx guidance, what level would you expect that to be in the second half of this year?
Chris Liddell

Yes. I said just to be clear, that it wasn't in the number of 27.4 that I mentioned, so it would be on top of that. And we’d expect it to be several tens of millions, but less than 100 million to give you an order of magnitude, and it’s going to depend entirely on the number of people that we talk about, yes, the individual circumstances. So I can't give you an exact number, but that's the order of magnitude.
Bill Koefoed

And next is Brad Reback with Oppenheimer.

Brad Reback – Oppenheimer

Hi guys. How are you?
Steve Ballmer

Good.
Brad Reback – Oppenheimer

I'm a little confused. If, Chris, as you talk about on the share repurchase side, slowing it down in the second half of the year, but on the other side when we are talking about $1.5 billion of cost coming out over the next 18 months, clearly it is still a very valuable franchise with a lot of cash flow, why not take this opportunity to buy back probably the best investment there is at least from your perspective?
Chris Liddell

Yes. My comments were certainly from the – over the long term, we remain committed to the buyback activity. The buyback activity in the first half was actually very high. All I did was signal that we expect in the second half that will moderate from that level. Will we continue to be a net buyer of our shares? Absolutely. Do we think liquidity in the current environment? Certainly, until we get a clearer pattern on economic activity overall. Is it a premium? Yes, I do. Do I think there's going to be some outstanding opportunities over the medium term to potentially buy some other companies that we have looked at? I’ll mitigate that by saying small to medium, yes, I do. So the opportunity cost of buying our shares has also gone up as well as the price going down. We are just trying to balance those factors, but we certainly are not talking about getting out of buyback activity as a general concept.
Steve Ballmer

I will remind you that there was a time when tendered our shares at 25 bucks because they looked super cheap for us. That we could – I mean it is hard to know what the underlying market is going to do, and asset values, and we just think it makes sense to keep a little bit more liquid for a while.
Chris Liddell

But also being consistent on this, we try not to tell you in advance what we are doing on the buyback activity. We do that in the quarter, all I'm doing is giving you a directional trend.

And next is John Difucci with JPMorgan.
John Difucci – JPMorgan

Thank you. Guys, can you just help me a little bit here in reconciling sort of a follow-up to some of the other questions, because you're talking about the declining environment actually meaning going down, and the uncertainty going forward, and you're resetting expenses to reflect this. But your new guidance for operating expenses is still up meaningfully in the second half year over year when you adjust for the third quarter charge last year. And it just if you really think things are – and they obviously are, we all know they are tough out there, and today it looks like it's coming down, it is getting worse year over year, but your expenses, you're laying off some people, no one like to see anybody get laid of, I am sure you don’t, we don’t, but net 2,000 to 3000 out of 91,000 or whatever you have, are you really resetting expenses to reflect what is out there?
Chris Liddell

Bear in mind of course in the year, half of the year has already gone, and we are reacting to a situation, as I say, and in particular, it’s in the back half of the quarter. So –
John Difucci – JPMorgan

This is year over year for just the second half. Your expenses are still up, your operating expenses are still going to be if you exclude the third quarter last year that 1.35 fine, so it is – I'm sorry, go ahead, Chris.
Chris Liddell

Your points are valid, and I am very happy to address that. What I described it as changing the momentum of our expense base going forward, but clearly we already have things in the pipeline and people who are employed, who we have to bear the expense of. So we are talking about a plan that stretches out over the next 18 months as opposed to the next few months of which the first few steps were taken in the quarter, that's why we were able to reduce by 600 million, 1.5 billion over this year and flat the year afterwards, and a program to reduce not only people internally, but the balance of initiatives that we took. So these things are layering in over time and are in response – you remember I talked about it at the last call, we are taking a set of initiatives in that quarter, and we said – I said at the time that if things got worse, we will probably look to do more. Things did get worse, and we did do more. So we're talking about layering in as we see economic conditions change. So, yes, we would all like to be able to take things out instantaneously. The reality is that we can't do that as quickly as we would like, but you will see us take actions that have an impact over the next few months.
Bill Koefoed

Operator, next question.
Operator

And next is Todd Raker from Deutsche Bank.
Todd Raker – Deutsche Bank

Thanks guys. Chris, I was wondering if you look at the overall corporation, could you give us a sense in terms of how kind of consumer versus transactional business versus annuity breaks out? And what's the risk as we look at this spending environment as the annuity business starts to show some dramatic impact over the next kind of six to 18 months?
Chris Liddell

The annuity business was good in the first quarter and the second quarter, so that’s certainly one of the strengths of that business model has been the relative insulation of our results from as a result of the annuity business, that's a very good point. Non-annuity business shrink during the second quarter, annuity business actually, the revenue associated with annuity business actually grew. So it is providing us some degree of insulation and we're talking about results obviously that are lower than expectations, but to just keep that in context, we still grew revenue 2% in probably the worst environment that we have seen. Part of the reason for that was the strength of annuity. Over the time, and in particular if we see the business environment deteriorate in the second half, clearly that annuity business will slow. Having said that, our re-signing rates inside the enterprises was broadly in line with historic rates. Billings were broadly flat in the annuity area year over year, so they aren’t growing as fast as they would, but they weren’t declining either. They were broadly flat. We have a very big second half from a billings perspective, so that we have the opportunity actually to put some more money back in the bank. So on that side of the business, certainly stronger historically, and that will provide us some degree of cushion as we go through the next six months to 12 months.
Steve Ballmer

The way I would characterize it is it is a bit of a dance oscillation. We are actually recognizing now contracts signed two or three years ago. The contracts, we are re-signing contracts – sometimes we're re-signing contracts with companies that have less employees, they have less PCs, so even if they are renewing their contracts, they may not be renewing at the same dollar value that the contracts expire at. The effect of that event shows up under revenue and all that stuff in the books. But from a net income, it takes longer. So if we stay in this cycle and there is fewer people employed in the US, eventually that does ripple through to the annuity business also.
Chris Liddell

But non-annuity is likely to be more volatile and more negative than the annuity which is likely to provide, as Steve says, it is likely to lower the oscillation of revenue overall.
Todd Raker – Deutsche Bank

And any rough –

Chris Liddell

Sorry, what was that?

Todd Raker – Deutsche Bank

I was just trying to get a rough sense for the percentage of the business that is annuity driven?

Chris Liddell

It changes a bit quarter by quarter because of things likes Xbox which is all clearly non-annuity and moves things. But it generally varies between 30% and 40% of our revenue.
Todd Raker – Deutsche Bank

Okay, thank guys.

Chris Liddell

That's the annuity side of 30% to 40%.

Next question operator.

And our next question comes from Robert Breza with RBC Capital Markets.
Robert Breza – RBC Capital Markets

Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe Steve, can you talk about as you look at the portfolio of businesses you have and obviously if you go through this economy the way it is, I mean when or if do you think you and the Board would take action to review your portfolio and make a strategic decision to possibly divest off certain assets or technologies, any color around the strategy in particular would be helpful? Thanks.
Steve Ballmer

I like our portfolio.
Robert Breza – RBC Capital Markets

Okay.

Steve Ballmer

The Board likes our portfolio.

Operator, next question, and this will be our last question.

Operator

And the last question comes from Katherine Egbert with Jefferies.

Katherine Egbert – Jefferies

Hi, good morning. So you said you are slowing buybacks to preserve capital. You said no significant M&A in the back half because the sellers haven't reset their expectations and yet you're adding search jobs. What are you really telling us here? Are you saying basically it’s a status quo with Yahoo?
Steve Ballmer

I don't think we said anything about Yahoo. I don't think we have anything to stay about Yahoo. I think – I’ve to see. Even I think I’d been quite public about the fact I think there is advantages with consumers, advertisers, Microsoft and Yahoo through a search partnership and we like to do one. I know Carol Bartz well from Autodesk days and glad to see her at the helm of Yahoo, and if it is appropriate, I'm sure we will have the right discussion.
Chris Liddell

Yes. Just to be clear, my comment about resetting the expectations was certainly not Yahoo specific. I think we are being quite clear that that acquisition is no longer on the books. It was a more general comment and my prediction of lower activity in the second half is just a prediction and nothing more than that. Clearly, we saw an opportunity as we do in terms of buying businesses one or two a month, and we take it. I am just simply making the psychological comment that most people on a downmarket hope that they will give last year's price rather than this year’s price.
Steve Ballmer

We have only bought one thing ever over $1.5 billion, and we have only bought three things over – other than that over $1 billion. We're not big M&A doers in general. And as Chris says, I know even small M&A is tougher as people get small, that is sub $1 billion acquisition prices are tougher because people just don't know how to value their businesses today.
Katherine Egbert – Jefferies

Okay, thanks.

And now, I'll return the call over to Chris.
Chris Liddell
Thanks, Bill. I'll begin with highlights from our first quarter performance and outlook for the rest of the fiscal 2009. We delivered strong first quarter financial results with revenue, operating income and earnings per share all meeting or exceeding the high end of our guidance despite what was obviously a very challenging environment.
Let me just mention a few key items of our first quarter. Revenue from Microsoft Business Division and Server and Tools segments grew a combined $1.3 billion, or 19%, driven by healthy demand from enterprise customers. Client revenue grew 2% with growth impacted by the expected reduction of Q4 channel inventory and a shift of the sales mix to lower price netbooks and the units sold in emerging markets.
Consumer demand for the Xbox 360 resulted in the outperformance by Entertainment and Devices division. Our Online Services Business grew revenue of very good 15% in a challenging online advertising environment. We refreshed our product lineup with several important releases and we also increased the dividend by 18% and announced a new $40 billion share repurchase authorization.
While we're pleased with the overall results, the macroeconomic environment clearly weakened throughout the quarter. Like many other companies we experienced deterioration in the spending environment over the last few weeks of the quarter, which has continued into October.
Accordingly, we're updating our business outlook to reflect the increased risks and the likelihood of continued economic slowdown. In July we indicated that our guidance was based on an expectation that economic conditions would improve in the second half of our fiscal year and this clearly now appears unlikely to occur.
We're not economic forecasters, and there is a high degree of uncertainty in outlook based on the state of the economy. As a result we've adjusted our guidance approach as follows. At the top end we're assuming a mild recession, and a relatively modest growth rate for all IT-based products. While at the bottom end we're assuming a deeper recession in the economy an end-season lower growth for IT.
Clearly there is a possibility that the economy recovers faster than we predict or that it deteriorates more severely. In all scenarios we're focused on maintaining the positive delta in growth rate between our revenue and the overall IT environment.
We feel extremely good about our relative competitive position, our ability to continue growing faster than general IT spending and our ability to deliver value to our customers in this environment. We believe our exceptionally strong cash flow, high unearned revenue and $25 billion in cash and investments on hand will allow us to weather any economic contraction in relatively better terms than most.
It's also clearly important to keep perspective. We still foresee an increase in demand for our products and the potential to drive revenue and earnings per share growth from high single to low double-digits for this financial year, which will be an exceptional performance in this environment.
With those high-level themes I'm going to turn the call over to Bill now for more details on how we closed out the first quarter.
Bill Koefoed
Thanks, Chris. I'll discuss top line financial and business momentum points, followed by revenue performance for each of our business units. Then I'll review the rest of the income statement. All growth comparisons relate to the comparable quarter of last year unless otherwise specified.
In the first quarter we met or exceeded our high end guidance for revenue, operating income, and earnings per share. Revenue grew over 9% to $15.1 billion, approximately $150 million above our high end guidance.
Our annuity sales mix which is approximately 25% of our billed revenue grew over three percentage points year-over-year. Enterprise agreement renewal rates were in line with historical trends. The remainder of our product to the (inaudible) of quarter was approximately 35% from OEMs, about 20% from license only sales and the balance from our other businesses.
Our unearned revenue grew over 16% to $13.5 billion, but was down sequentially from the prior quarter. The sequential decline was in line with our guidance and followed normal seasonal patterns. Our contracted not billed balance increased both sequentially and year-over-year to over $13 billion.
When taken together with reported revenue, total bookings for the company increased 6% this quarter on top of our over 30% total bookings growth reported in Q1 FY '08. Overall, changes in foreign exchange rates added about three percentage points to our revenue growth.
Now I will provide revenue highlights by business segment starting with Windows clients. The Client revenue grew 2% to $4.2 billion, missing guidance by four percentage points. I'll review the main drivers behind Client revenues that contributed to this performance beginning with PC unit growth.
We estimate that the PC unit growth rate for the quarter was between 10% and 12%. While this tracks to the overall forecast we provided in July, the underlying mix was different than we expected entering the quarter. Specifically, growth of traditional PC units was several points lower than we expected. This was offset by growth in the new low end, netbook segment.
From a geographic perspective, we estimate mature market traditional PC growth of flat to low single-digits with netbooks adding about eight points to the growth. In emerging markets we continued to see strong double-digit growth across all segments.
During the quarter, our Windows OEM license units increased by 8%, a few points lower than the overall hardware market. The shortfall between OEM unit growth and hardware growth was primarily driven by inventory reductions in the OEM channel. As we mentioned in the last earnings call, we exited the fourth quarter with OEM channel inventory above historic norms, which were worked down during the quarter.
Despite healthy unit growth, OEM revenue declined 1% year-over-year as the average selling price declined. This was primarily the result of two factors. The mix shift in netbooks and continued mix shift to emerging markets, both of which have lower average selling prices than our historical average selling price.
At this stage it is too early to determine the extent to which the new netbooks segment is cannibalizing the traditional consumer PC market sales or simply capturing a new market opportunity, so we believe that there are likely aspects of both.
That said, customers are increasingly opting for the value, diversity and choice that Microsoft Windows provides. We have increased attach rates on these form factors to mirror the traditional PC market, so we are well positioned to participate in this segment.
The remainder of Client revenue comes from commercial and retail licensing. This portion of the business grew over 20% driven by continued strength in client annuity licensing as business customers recognize the value of our Windows Vista enterprise offering, including those to help them reduce costs by more efficiently managing their desktop infrastructure.
Our Server and Tools revenue grew 17% to $3.4 billion, marking the business 25th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Annuity licensing grew faster than non-annuity licensing driving Server and Tools unearned revenue up over 28% from the prior year. This reflects continued customer commitment to our long-term product road map and underscores the increasingly critical role our server products perform in transforming customers IT departments into strategic assets.
The releases during the quarter of Sequel Server 2008 and Microsoft Hyper-V Server 2008 demonstrated our ongoing commitment to help customers create more cost effective and flexible data centers. Meanwhile, demand for our consulting and support services to deploy Microsoft technology remained strong, driving revenue growth of 19%.
The Online service business grew revenue 15% to $770 million. Online advertising revenue also grew 15% with search revenue growing faster than display revenue. We continue to see healthy growth in our traffic to page views and query searches both up on sequential and year-over-year basis.
During the quarter we partnered with NBC to make the 2008 Beijing Olympics the largest ever media event on the web, showcasing Silverlight as it served up 70 million video streams and 600 million minutes of video content on NBColympics.com. As new online advertising model strived to increasingly differentiate based on user experience. Microsoft technologies like Silverlight become even more pivotal to our partners success.
Microsoft Business Division revenue was up 20% to $4.9 billion exceeding our high end guidance by four percentage points. Business revenue grew 16% driven by strong sales of enterprise agreements and Client access license suites. Microsoft Office, SharePoint, Dynamics and Unified Communications all continued strong sales momentum.
Consumer revenue grew 36% driven by higher than expected sales into the retail and OEM channels resulting from well received promotional pricing programs for the 2007 Microsoft Office system.
Entertainment and Devices division revenue declined 6% to $1.8 billion, but exceeded our high end guidance. The anticipated revenue decline due the comparison to the quarter a year ago that included the launch of Halo 3 was milder than expected due to stronger Xbox 360 console sales into the channel.
We sold 2.2 million Xbox 360 consoles representing over 20% growth, as retailers stocked inventories throughout the holiday season. Based on US MPD numbers released last week, Xbox 360 outsold PS3 by over 100,000 consoles during the quarter while achieving an industry leading game attach rate of 8.1.
Also, earlier this month at the Tokyo game show we announced that Xbox Live has over 14 million members, roughly doubling in membership for each of the last two years. In spite of console price cuts taken in the quarter and the absence of Halo 3, the Entertainment and Devices Division increased operating income by 7%, expanding its operating margins by over a percentage point.
Now for the rest of the income statement. Cost of goods sold was $2.8 billion and operating expenses were $6.2 billion. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue declined half a percentage point to 18.9%. This gross margin expansion was driven by lower console manufacturing, warranty and component costs, as well as a mix shift towards the lower cost Xbox 360 arcade console.
Operating income was $6 billion, up 3% from the year-ago period. Other income and expenses was an $8 million loss for the quarter as dividend was offset by asset revaluations. It should be noted that we continue to be pleased by our treasury team's performance in a very challenging capital market environment.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 27%, a percentage point lower than expected, driven by an earnings mix increase in lower tax jurisdictions. During the quarter, we repurchased 223 million shares or almost $6 billion of company stock and paid out a billion dollars in dividends to shareholders.
Of the $6 billion in share buybacks, approximately $3.3 billion was made under the new repurchase plan that we announced in September. Diluted shares outstanding were 9.2 billion, down 3.5% from the prior year as a result of the share repurchases.
Earnings per share were $0.48, at the high end of our guidance, representing growth of 7%. So, in summary, we had a good quarter with revenue above expectations, operating income in line with guidance, and earnings per share at the high end of guidance.
With that, let me turn it back to Chris who will provide you with our second quarter and full year guidance.
Chris Liddell
I'm going to spend my remaining time on the call talking about what we're seeing in the market and providing additional details on the second quarter and the full year. Our guidance now assumes an outcome between a mild and a deeper recessionary environment. It's important that we give you some background therefore to what we're seeing in the marketplace.
Over the first two months of this quarter we experienced much the same economic conditions as we saw during the second half of fiscal 2008, with demand actually a little better than our historic seasonality. However, in September, as the credit crisis unfolded, many partners and customers were faced with market uncertainty and credit restrictions which impacted the rate at which they purchased software.
We've seen this behavior continue into October and while we're optimistic about the actions the governments have taken to unfreeze the financial markets there will be some spillover into the real economy. However, even in this environment of softening demand, recent third party research continues to call for growth in overall technology spending, with the enterprise software portion of the spending expected to be up in the high single-digit range.
Our approach will be to tailor our business to whatever the economy brings, focusing on outperforming our competitors and in doing so, to outgrow the overall IT market. We will be agile, not only to customer demands in the changing environment but also to our own patterns of spending.
Given that, we have three main areas of focus. First, our philosophy of providing high value products at low total ownership costs as a competitive advantage in these times. Most IT leaders today are looking at their budgets and determining how to do more while spending less. We expect Microsoft's low cost, standardized platforms and solutions will be particularly strong in the time when enterprises are unwilling to embark on complex customized IT solutions.
We believe we have some compelling products that will reduce our customers' costs. We expect these to be particularly competitive in this environment. For example, virtualization with Windows Server Hyper-V and System [sender] Management Tools, which allow customers to reduce hardware costs, increase server utilization rates and simplify system maintenance while lowering power and facility costs.
We offer the lowest PCO in the industry with our solution about one-third the cost of our largest competitor. This value proposition is already successful as evidenced in IDC's recent report which shows that in the second quarter Microsoft's share of the X86 server virtualization market climbed to nearly 25%.
Additionally, with our help customers can experience general cost savings and improved efficiency across their organization. For example using unified communication software and services including Office Live Meeting, which help us improve collaboration and increase productivity while reducing travel and telephonic expenses.
SharePoint improves the coordination across organizations, enables people to find and act on information anywhere within and across organizations and decreases IT support costs by empowering end users.
The second area we're focused on in the current economic environment is internal operational efficiency and expense management. In the near term, we're reassessing our business plan and pulling back spending in lower priority areas. As a result, better than our guidance is a $400 million to $500 million decrease in operating expenses.
This saving can be categorized as follows. Lower headcount related costs as we review the hiring plans, making adjustments to our headcount growth. Lower marketing expenses as we're adjusting our spending plans to correspond to our updated economic outlook. Lower CapEx spend on data centers and other general savings including travel expenses and vendor services.
These savings will progressively layer in, translating to economic savings particularly later this year and carrying forward into the next fiscal year as well. We are also putting in place other initiatives on a contingency basis that we can either dial up or down as we see economic changes unfold. If macroeconomic conditions worsen then we will endeavor to reduce our operating expenses accordingly.
Third, we'll focus our investment dollars in key strategic opportunities. Continue to manage our business for the long-term in anticipation of the eventual economic recovery. While our short-term results will be impacted by the current economic environment, our long-term technology outlook remains strong. Long-term trends, which power our business including the development of IT infrastructure and growing IT penetration in places like China and even other emerging markets remains intact.
So with those comments, let's move to guidance. Looking to the second quarter we expect revenue of 17.3 to $17.8 billion, which represents a year-over-year increase of 6% to 9%. For the full year, we're providing updated guidance for revenue of $64.9 million to $66.4 billion, growing 7% to 10%.
Let me provide you with some of our revenue guidance by segments and some additional details of and the assumptions underlying it. Beginning with our Client division, we see second quarter growth of 7 to 10%, and full year growth of 2% to 6%. Underlying this guidance we see significant variability in the potential PC hardware demand. As a result, we made some adjustments to our forecast of PC units and now expect PC unit growth of 10% to 12% for the second quarter and 8% to 12% for the overall fiscal year.
You can see that we've widened our forecast range in the second half of our fiscal year as variability in the market demand clearly becomes more pronounced. The forecast also reflects continuation of the trends we saw in the first quarter, and assumes the following. Traditional mature market PC units will grow in the low single-digits, but with high potential variability. Emerging markets units will continue to grow mid to high teens. Sales in Xbox led about five percentage points of growth to the overall PC market.
Moving on to our Server and Tools segment, we're now foreseeing revenue growth of 16% to 17% for the second quarter and 15% to 17% for the year. Despite a more cautious IT spending outlook, and in particular lower forecast for non-annuity license sales to small and medium businesses, we continue to expect revenue to grow strong double-digits across our Server platform products and services, reflection of the strength of the product portfolio and its relative value to customers.
Microsoft Business Division revenues should be up 7% to 8% in the second quarter and 12% to 13% for the year. We expect to see continued healthy consumer and enterprise demand for our Office, SharePoint, Dynamics and Unified Communications offerings.
We forecast revenue in the Online Services businesses to increase 6% to 10% in Q2 and 10% to 13% for the year. This includes online advertising growth of about 15% for the year. Still healthy in a more difficult advertising spending environment we expect.
Our display advertising business is probably the most economically sensitive of our revenue stream and therefore has the highest potential to either under or outperform depending on the state of the economy.
The Entertainment Devices division we're forecasting revenue to be down 5% to up 1% for Q2 and down 3% or flat for the full year. Revenue growth is impacted by our recent Xbox 360 pricing cuts, buts offset by increases in console volumes and lower costs. As I outlined in July, we still expect the division to continue its profitability throughout this year.
Taken together, we still expect to grow revenue faster than market. For example we're forecasting MBD and Server and Tools to grow revenue a combined 14% to 15%, about six points above Gartner's recent forecast for overall IT software spending of around 9%.
As a result of the changes to our revenue and operating expense forecast, the operating income for the second quarter is expected to be between $6.1 billion and $6.4 billion, and for the year we expect operating income to be between $24.4 billion and $25.5 billion. For the second quarter, we expect EPS, earnings per share of $0.51 to $0.53 and for the fiscal year we have updated our EPS guidance to be between $2 to $2.10, still achieving double-digit growth of 12% at the top end. These earnings assume effective tax rate of 26.5%, a point and-a-half lower than we expected in July.
From a balance sheet perspective, we expect total unearned revenue to finish fiscal 2009 up 2% to 5% and when talking sequential changes on unearned revenue Q1 to Q2 we expect the balance to be down sequentially. Contracted not billed should also finish 2009 up from current levels.
I'm also pleased with our continued progress on capital structure and dividend policy. During the quarter as you've seen, the Board authorized $40 billion share repurchase program. We issued debt in the form of commercial paper for the first time and we've been issuing that at an interest cost of less than 1% and increased our dividend by 18%.
Given the uncertainty surrounding the current environment, it's important that you clearly consider some of the risks of this forecast, which includes the normal competitive legal, mix and execution risks, however in addition there is also a high degree of uncertainty as to the path and economic demand and that's reflected in a somewhat wider guidance range.
So, before closing and taking your questions, I'd like to offer the following long-term perspectives. We cannot control the economy, but we can control our relative performance versus the economy and versus overall IT spend. We continue to forecast outgrowing the market regardless of the economic conditions.
On the spending front, we're carefully examining all of our businesses for opportunities to manage expenses and have already implemented some initiatives as I detailed earlier. We will adapt our cost base to the evolving economy while simultaneously making appropriate investments to position ourselves for continued long-term success when the economy recovers.
On balance, I am happy that we're managing the company with the right balance of short-term earnings performance and driving long-term shareholder value. So with those comments I'll hand the call over to Bill so we can get started taking some of your questions. Thanks.
Bill Koefoed

Great, thank you. Good afternoon Chris and Kevin. I had two quick questions for you, Chris. What is your assumptions for premium mix in the Client business for the December quarter and for fiscal year '09. That's been moving around a lot and obviously being impacted by the netbook trend. And then the other question would be how should we expect Client margins to be impacted by the trend going forward? Thank you.
Chris Liddell
On the premium mix, it's in the mid-70s, Heather and for Q2 and for the rest of the year we expect that to be about the same. So somewhere in the 70% to 80% region, probably on balance, in the low 70s to mid-70s. That premium mix, based in the netbook sales as well. So that has both low end Vista and netbook sales in it.
In terms of margins, it's a difficult one to answer because you've got the weighted average of lots of growth factors in there. Clearly, the realization that we get from netbooks are lower than what we traditionally get from the consumer segment. And to the extent that they are relatively high growth and it does impact our overall revenue per license.
But to the extent that it is growth that we wouldn't otherwise have had and that's the phenomenon that I don't think any of us really know at this stage, how much of it is cannibalization of higher revenue per licenses and how much of it just simply new sales, then it's incremental sales, even though it drags down the average.
So, clearly some of it is partially cannibalization, some of it is a new phenomenon. If you look at the price points of the some of the netbooks they are $300 to $400, clearly that is attractive for a lot of people in terms of adding a third or fourth PC to their homes. So it's not just transparents of higher end PCs as well. So it will affect the margins but some of that will be incremental growth that we wouldn't otherwise have had.
Heather Bellini - UBS
So will we start thinking of this business like we do your overall operating profit as growth in operating income and Client are supposed to focusing on the absolute margin percentage?
Chris Liddell
Yeah, I think that's a good way of thinking about it, and what we really have now is quite different segments inside the PC market. It's becoming more interesting in that sense but you have quite different dynamics in the business market, the consumer, non-netbooks market, the consumer netbooks market and the emerging country version of all of those as well. Quite different growth rates, quite different realizations and quite different dynamics driving that. So it becomes, if you like more complicated from a forecasting point of view but a more interesting marketplace.
Heather Bellini - UBS
Okay, thank you very much.
Chris Liddell
Thanks.

Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Citi.
Brent Thill - Citigroup
Thanks. Chris, just on the operating margin side, can you just walk through some of the metrics you're putting in or procedures you're putting in to control the costs. I think you mentioned CapEx and headcount. Are you still on track to do $4 billion on CapEx this year and I guesses just from a headcount perspective I think you ended last year at 91,000 employees, up 15%. Do you expect to freeze or significantly slow that number.
Chris Liddell
On the CapEx side I would expect us to spend upwards of $300 million less than what we were anticipating, so we were talking about 4 before [237] and probably a better number at this stage. That will all be in the data sense side. We will probably also slow our growth in some of the facilities that we have the people just by virtue of not having as many people as were expected as well. But that's likely to be more of an FY '10 phenomenon.
In terms of, sorry what was the second part of your question.
Brent Thill - Citigroup
Just as it relates to headcount you ended the year at 91,000 heads, up 15%. Do you expect to heir or slow that pace?
Chris Liddell
I don't see any scenario where we'll grow by that much this year, by 15%. So it would certainly be less than that and it will be less than what we expect them to grow in the year coming into the year. So what we've done is, since we have gone right across the company, every division and looked at areas where we can if you like to have lower priorities spending taken out.
So some of that is headcount growth that we might have otherwise had, some of its in marketing spend in areas where there's not the demand that we're expecting. Some of it's other, so it's non-people related costs, window spend, travel and things like that. So we're really cutting back on all of the areas which I consider as to I'll call it non-priority or low priority.
In terms of where we might go further, you know we'll keep looking at those areas as the year develops. From my point of view, in terms of the margin structure, for our core business as a result of the cuts that we will see and what we would have otherwise spend, the margins for our core business overall will stay broadly flat year-on-year. Entertainment and devices always teach you to have their own dynamic, but all of those divisions will spend little less than what they would have otherwise.
Brent Thill - Citigroup
Thanks, Chris.
Operator
And our next question comes from Charlie DiBona with Sanford Bernstein.
Charlie DiBona - Sanford Bernstein
Hi, Chris. I was wondering if we could turn maybe to unearneds here. They were down sequentially sort of by an unusually large amount from Q1 to Q4 and you're guiding to down sequentially next quarter which is different than your historic seasonality and even to regarding even to sort of a weak increase year-over-year by the end of the year. I understand there's an issue around undelivered elements also be sort of systemically coming down here. But even the VLA unearneds are down so its an unusual amount.
How should we interpret this? What should we infer about your ability to sort of replenish those balances in this environment? And second as you are pulling those revenues down they should be extremely high margin. Maybe you can give us some light color on sort of what that means for controlling for that what apples-to-apples margins really look like?
Chris Liddell
Good question, Charlie. In terms of quarter one relative to quarter four it was down, that's certainly true, but obviously quarter four is a big billings quarter for us. So you would expect it to be down year-on-year, it's down about the same as what we would normally expect.
During the course of the year in unearneds you've also got the Vista impact and undelivered elements. So you need to net that out to look at the unearned part that is not sister associated with that. So there is a couple of factors there that you need to build in. In terms of how we think about it going forward, and better than our guidance is clearly some sense that we will have a more difficult economic environment and that's going to have to feed into the billings overall.
In the first quarter, interestingly, we continued our EA renewal rate of sort of traditional two-thirds or thereabouts. So the first quarter we saw very good. But there's just going to be pressure. All of our customers are clearly going to be looking for opportunities to cut costs and so also we're just being more cautious in terms of the rate at which we might have renewals or the rate at which we may sell to our new customers.
Now all of that sales force, I sat in for half a day with our sales force yesterday going through area-by-area and segment-by-segment, all of them are committed to their budgets but you have to be realistic and say in this environment, we may not get the growth that we would have liked to have seen otherwise.
So I'm just generally more cautious and that will feed through to our unearned over time. One of the benefits we have is in the areas like MBD and Server and Tools, about 40% of our revenue this year is from unearned coming through from last year.
So it's going to be an FY '10 impact as much as an FY '09 impact that I'm concerned about Charlie, and as we get through the second quarter and get much more visibility into that I think we'll have to cut our costs for FY '10 depending on how we see the billings approach in the December period, which is much more significant and then also going into potentially into the June resignings as well.
So it's an emerging issue. I don't see it that significant just at the moment. It's going to depend enormously on the environment that develops over the next three to six months and that's going to be an FY '10 sort of issue and upside, depending on where we get to.
Charlie DiBona - Sanford Bernstein
And on the margin side, though, you're pulling this high revenue, these billings you're pulling them down a little faster than you did last year. Is that going to give you some cushion on the margin side?
Chris Liddell

I don't see if cushions the margin side. It will help give us an underpinning on the revenue growth and to the extent that that revenue is effectively 100% margin that's already paid. So, as it comes through, it's just revenue that's there. It will help us with, if you like, the underwriting the revenue. I don't see it as high margin, per se.
Charlie DiBona - Sanford Bernstein
Thanks, Charlie.
Bill Koefoed
Let's move to the next question, please. Operator?
Operator
Yes. And the next question comes from Sarah Friar from Goldman Sachs.
Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs
Good afternoon, everyone. Two quick ones. Chris, just on the margin, back to margins, I know you don't like to guide to a margin, but I think you made the comment that margin is broadly flat year-over-year, given the cost focus that you have.
Why shouldn't Microsoft be thinking about margin expansion, just given your size, the fact we're going into a downturn, it really gives companies an ability to go back in and cut not just kind of semi discretionary, but really kind of cut back and think what a new operating model could look like with a slower top-line growth for a couple of years.
And then just if I could, a follow-up on the EPS side, what buyback assumptions if any have you got within your EPS guidance as you think about the next couple of quarters. I think normally you say you don't want to give it, but it seems like there's not a lot in there just based on how the guidance stacks up.
Chris Liddell
Yes. The way that we spend and the way that our revenue is recognized, really are two quite separate trends and we have talked about this before. So, when I think about how much we should save, I think about it in the context of what are the opportunities to save against the expense base that we have. Not as against the revenue base that we have.
So, the revenue are adjusted both in terms of the economic conditions that we think for this year. The expense base we've adjusted to try and retain margins as much as possible, but more against the opportunities set of where we can take expense out.
In terms of our ability to expand margins in an environment like this, again, I would say that's an FY '10 and further. That's the sort of discussions that we have and the strategy reviews as opposed to how we run the business in the short-term. I made the comment in the commentary that I think we're making the right balance of taking cost out in the short term, but still investing for the future.
As we start to put our forecasts for how we see the environment in fiscal year '10, '11 and so forth, then we have to start making some divisions about more structural change on the expense side as opposed to saving what we have already budgeted for this year. So, the two are clearly mathematically connected to each other but in terms of the way that we manage them are really quite separate.
On buyback, as you know, we don't forecast about buybacks. We did $6 billion in the quarter. Clearly, we have a new authorization in place now, and we have the economic ability to continue the buybacks and share prices are certainly relatively attractive. But we don't forecast, what we will do in any one particular quarter.
Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs
Okay. I will get back in queue.
Bill Koefoed
Thanks, Sarah. Operator, next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Kash Rangan from Merrill Lynch.
Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch
Hi, thank you very much. Two questions for you, Chris. One is looking at the cash flow statement there is an unusual deduction in current liability, and I was wondering if you could offer some perspective on that.
Secondly, at a very high level, just doing some rough back of the envelope math here. Your revenue guidance now compared to where it was three months back is about 300 basis points lower and when I flow through that incremental impact at a 70%, 75% contribution margin, which is what I would expect given that most of your core business products are at that margin.
I would expect that a lot of that negative impact to earnings can be offset through your share buybacks and even if you slowed down your pace of share buybacks to let's say 3 billion to 4 billion per quarter for the next three quarters. I would imagine the EPS impact, the negative EPS impact should be largely offset, yet we do have cautious guidance. You should completely understand and appreciate, given the economic environment. But I just wonder as I go through this tradeoff, if there is a little bit more cautiousness that is built in than what meets the eye. That's it. Thanks.
Chris Liddell
Okay. Fine. In terms of the unusual amount that you talked about, we did settle a past IRS exam for the years 2000 to 2003. So, that was a large one-off payment to the tax department. And it was actually lower than what we were expecting, and we recall that we released some of the provisions last quarter. So, that was the large payment that you're alluding to from a cash flow point of view.
Secondly on the margin side, you are correct that buybacks will certainly offset some of the loss of margin that we have at an operating income level. One of the things that will dampen that, to some extent is the investment income that we have. We're more cautious in what we expect to get from our investment income line. You saw it was essentially zero for this quarter and it's just a difficult environment, clearly, to make high returns or any significant returns from our investment portfolio.
So, that will offset a little bit of the buyback impact that you talked about. The other thing to point out is that as we lose sales and most of our businesses, last you applied our average margin, the marginal margin, if I can call it that, is probably higher than that. So, some of the sales that we have really are 90% plus, given the relatively low COGS associated with them.
So if we lose revenue, our ability to take cost out in the short-term equal to that, to keep our margins intact, is very challenging. Now, we're looking to do that, and as I mentioned before in those three core businesses, I think we can retain margins year-over-year. But that's pretty difficult to make up from either cost reduction or from buyback overall. And it will certainly offset it and we have the benefit of both strong cash flow and a strong financial position which helps us. But I don't see it being a total offset.
Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch
Got it. Thanks a lot.
Bill Koefoed
Thanks, Kash. Operator, next question please.

Next is John Difucci with JPMorgan.
John Difucci - JPMorgan
Thank you. Chris, you saw your Client revenue go up about 2% this quarter and your guidance is for 2% to 6% growth for the year. But you expect 7% to 10% for the December quarter, and you've talked about at the beginning of this quarter seeing some weakness overall, you didn't specifically mention this business. Just curious, though, what gives you the confidence in this 7% to 10% growth for this quarter?
Chris Liddell
It's really around as we go further out in the year we just get more uncertain. So, we've widened the range in particular in the back half of the year. So we think, particularly with Christmas coming up, that overall sales will be relatively good. We have reasonably good visibility into this quarter in terms of the inventory positions. We feel pretty good about some of the initiatives that we have in the unlicensed area. We've got channel inventory down to where we would like to see it.
So, our visibility is better in this quarter than it is in some of the later quarters. So, it's simply as we go further out in the year, we just become more cautious.
John Difucci - JPMorgan
Okay. And if I might just a quick follow-up, I just wondered if there's any potential for any channel issues, Entertainment and Device really strong this quarter, but two years ago was really strong, and then later on we found out there was, that channel was over full, I guess. And I don't think it's related but you had a big jump in inventory on the balance sheet probably like over 60%. Are those two things related or can you just address those two?
Chris Liddell
Yeah. We are feeling good about the overall level of inventory going into the Christmas period. We had a strong sell-in quarter you're correct and we have got a reasonable amount of inventory on our balance sheet in terms of our own boxes.
Having said that, the price points that we're looking at for this Christmas, at 199 for Arcade, 299 Pro, 399 Elite are very good. So none of us know exactly how, this economic situation is going to play out in terms of Christmas purchases. But when you look at those relative price points, either relative to our competition, sort of an absolute dollars relative to other things you people might purchase, it's nowhere near as significant as it was, say, last Christmas.
So clearly, we don't know what Christmas will look like. But given our relative position, I think we're in pretty good shape from an inventory perspective.
Bill Koefoed
Thanks, John.

And our next question comes from Adam Holt from Morgan Stanley.
Adam Holt - Morgan Stanley
Good afternoon. I had a couple questions about currency. I believe a lot of your non-US business is actually billed in US dollars, like some of the OEM business and some of the emerging markets. Roughly, what percentage of your revenue, if you have a number, is actually in US dollars and what are your assumptions around currency for the rest of fiscal '09?
Chris Liddell
The easiest way to think about it is three, lots of one-third. About a third of our business is in US dollars in North America. About a third of our business is in US dollars, but sold in countries outside of the US. And about a third of our business is sold in international currency and countries outside of the US.
So, you correct, a large part in particularly the OEM sales is for units that are sold outside the US, but we bill in US dollars. That's the easiest way of thinking about it. So, around a third is directly impacted by foreign exchange movements.
In terms of the assumptions going forward, we are pretty much fully hedged for this year so regardless of the FX rate that you assume, the revenue guidance that we're giving is pretty solid, it won't change much depending on the currency. It will start to impact us more in fiscal year '10 as some of those hedges roll off. But we went into the year a 100% hedged and so at the moment we're benefiting from a lower exchange rate, in terms of those hedges being valuable.
Adam Holt - Morgan Stanley
Terrific. In fact if I could just ask a follow-up on the Office business. Obviously, good quarter in MBD with particular strength in the consumer side. Now the comparisons are easy for consumer for the next couple of quarters. You did mention some incentive programs this quarter. What are your expectations around the consumer growth and any further incentives there? Thanks.
Chris Liddell
That doesn't seem to certainly help drive growth in the first quarter. To the extent they're not evident or they're not in existence in the second quarter, we're more conservative, embedded in the guidance in MBD for the second quarter. We still think the overall customer proposition is very good, but we certainly saw a volume lift from some of those incentives in the first quarter. So, you're correct there. But we don't think it's going to be a significant phenomenon in the second quarter.
Bill Koefoed
Thanks, Adam. Operator, next question, please.

Next is Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.
Phillip Winslow - Credit Suisse
Hi, guys. Just had a question on the PC outlook for the rest of the fiscal year and Q4. I think you mentioned 10% to 12% year-over-year growth, so just your PC shipment expectations. Just kind of looking at what that is sequentially, that’s about 10% to 12% sequential uplift, which is basically what we've seen in the past several December quarters. Just wondering what you see on the outlook there that gives you the confidence that we have a similar type of uplift heading into the December quarter here.
Chris Liddell
Sure, what I actually said was our outlook for the year is 8 to 12. So, I think I talked about 10 to 12 for the second quarter and 8 to 12 for the full year. Now, to the extent that the front half is around 10 to 12 and the year is 8 to 12, the implication just on simple average is that the back half of the year we're saying 6 to 12.
So, that's a lot wider range and it's also on average lower. So, we are more cautious as the year goes on about not only the overall level of growth, but also the variability in that growth. So, if you take the average of that number, let's say 9% on the back half, that's a couple of points lower on average than the first half of the year and also with a much wider spread.
So, we're pretty conservative on what the back half of the year might look like. And in particular, where the growth might come from. So, we think certainly netbooks growth will continue to be relatively robust, emerging markets will be. But in the back half of the year, we're feeling pretty cautious about in particular mature markets, core PC growth. That could be flat to single digits. That could be flat to single digit.
Phillip Winslow - Credit Suisse
And then just for the December quarter, just with the Holiday season so forth, just the outlook heading into that, that's why I mentioned the 10% to 12%, sort of just what that implies sequentially?
Chris Liddell
Sorry, 10% to 12% for the December quarter. And that would be, again, single to mid-digits for the mature markets, solid double digits for the emerging markets and then probably about a five percentage point uplift as a result of netbooks. Is that the question you were asking?
Phillip Winslow - Credit Suisse
That's perfect. Thank you.
Chris Liddell
Okay, great.
Bill Koefoed

Our last question comes from Israel Hernandez from Barclays Capital.
Israel Hernandez - Barclays Capital
Good afternoon, everyone. Chris, how should we be thinking about Microsoft's M&A strategy as we move through this down cycle? Do you see an opportunity to perhaps accelerate the pace as valuations come in? I'm not talking necessarily specifically around the Yahoo! situation, but its more generally with respect to enterprise software.
Chris Liddell
Clearly, the benefit this environment has to us, if there is one is in lower asset prices and we continue to be a net acquirer of businesses. Last year, as we bought around 24, so two a month. And we will continue to buy in particular in the sort of small or medium size businesses which are our real sweet spot.
I see our real constraint is not being capital in that, but its simply our ability to integrate. So, I don't see us necessarily increasing the volume of acquisitions and in fact a lot of people will see this as a difficult time to sell, because they'll see their prices as being depressed. But to the extent that we do buy, which I think we'll continue then it's likely to cost us less than it would have otherwise.
So generally, it's going to be a good environment for us and clearly relatively speaking we're still very cash rich. So, we are certainly not constrained from a capital point of view in buying companies. It's very much around, do they set the product road map and do we have the people and management capability to integrate them.
Israel Hernandez - Barclays Capital

Welcome to the Microsoft 2008 fourth quarter and fiscal year-end conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Colleen Healy, General Manager, Investor Relations. Madam, you may begin. 
Colleen Healy
Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This afternoon I am joined by: Chris Liddell, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Corporate Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; and John [Setok], Deputy General Counsel. 
Today’s call will start with Chris providing some key takeaways for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 and an overview of expectations for fiscal year ‘09. I will then provide details around our fourth quarter results and then hand it back to Chris for a more detailed discussion of our guidance for the full year and first quarter of fiscal 2009. After that, we’ll take your questions. 
Our earnings release includes and addendum of financial highlights, which contains more detailed information about revenue, operating expenses, and other items. We also posted our quarterly financial summary slide deck, which is intended to follow the flow of our prepared remarks in order to assist you. The slide deck offers highlights from the quarter, outlines our guidance, and provides a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures [inaudible].

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. 
With that, let me now turn it over to Chris. 
Christopher P. Liddell
Thanks, Colleen, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start today’s call with a few highlights from the year and then give you an overview of our expectations for fiscal year 2009. 
Quarter four results capped off an outstanding year for the company in terms of both operating and financial performance. All three of our key financial measures met or exceeded the guidance we provided entering the year, despite a challenging economic environment. For the year, revenue, operating income, and earnings per share increased 18%, 21%, and 32% respectively. 
Furthermore, the 18% revenue growth represents our fastest annual revenue growth in almost a decade. These results demonstrate the breadth of our business model, revenue growth being fueled by strong customer demand for our products and services across all of our businesses. 
Our core businesses of client, Microsoft business division, and server and tools turned in fantastic results, growing revenue a combined 15% in the year. The online services business grew revenue 32%, while entertainment and devices division was up 34% for the year. 
Looking at the fiscal year results from a geographic perspective, revenue in the U.S. increased approximately 15%. Other mature markets were up 16% and emerging markets grew a tremendous 35%. 
Now for a couple of key points on our outlook for fiscal 2009, with our planning and budgeting process [in place]. Our revenue and operating income [growth trends] remain relatively consistent with what we told you in April. Specifically, we expect revenue growth of 11% to 13%, operating income growth of 17% to 20%, and earnings per share growth of [13% to 17%]. 
Since we last gave you guidance, we’ve increased investments in three ways. First, we’ve continued to make a number of important inorganic acquisitions. We’re taking the view that the current environment is in fact a positive one to acquire companies if you are in the fortunate position of having a strong balance sheet and a willingness to take a long-term view. 
Second, we’ve increased organic investments in operating expenses, driven in particular by a deliberate decision to invest more aggressively in our online services strategy. 
Last, we remain committed to investing in ourselves through our ongoing share repurchases. For the year, we repurchased over $12 billion of our stock, with $5 billion of that amount occurring in the fourth quarter. 
One final comment before we get into the details; clearly we’re disappointed that our strong financial results are not reflected in our share price because of general market turbulence combined with Microsoft specific issues, including the uncertainty over the outcome of Yahoo! discussions. 
In this environment, we remain focused on driving the factors inside our control. In particular, from my perspective, improving long-term earnings per share. I’m satisfied that despite difficult economic conditions, should we achieve the middle of our guidance for fiscal year ’09, we will have increased our earnings per share from $1.42 to $2.15 in two years, an increase of 50% over that period. 
With those high level themes for 2008 and 2009, I’m going to turn the call over to Colleen now for more details on how we closed out last year. 
Colleen Healy
Thanks, Chris. The fourth quarter was a solid finish to an outstanding year. For the quarter we met our top and bottom line guidance, driven by 18% revenue growth. Let me provide you with the details of our financial performance, starting with revenue. I will discuss top line financial and business momentum points and then follow with revenue performance for each of the business units. Then I’ll review the rest of the income statement. 
All growth comparisons relate to the comparable quarter of last year unless otherwise specified. 
Revenue grew 18% to $15.8 billion, with every business growing in the mid-teens or higher. Our annuity sales mix, which is approximately 40% of our billing revenue, continued to grow on both a year-over-year and sequential basis, with enterprise agreement renewal rates in line with historical trends. 
The remainder of our product billings for the quarter was approximately 25% from OEM, around 15% from license only sales, and the balance from our other businesses. 
Our unearned revenue grew 21% to $15.3 billion, over $600 million above our high-end guidance. Our contracted not billed balance increased both sequentially and year over year to over $13 billion, about $3 billion above where we started the fiscal year. When taken together with reported revenue, total bookings for the company grew 23%, driven by over 20% bookings growth for our core businesses of server and tools, client, and the Microsoft business division. 
Overall, changes in foreign exchange rates added about four percentage points to our revenue growth. 
Now I will provide revenue highlights by business segment, starting with client and its biggest driver, the PC market. We estimate that the PC unit growth rates for the quarter returned to the 12% to 14% range that we experienced in the first half of the fiscal year. This is about three points above our forecast, due to improvements in mature markets, including in the United States. This helps to drive client revenue growth of 15% to $4.4 billion, which was over $150 million above our high-end guidance. 
During the quarter, our OEM license units increased by 22%, about nine points faster than the overall hardware market. OEM unit growth outpaced that of the PC market, primarily driven by a couple of factors: one, our OEM partners always have channel fluctuations. With this quarter, we estimate were a combination of replenishing the channel from lower Q3 levels as well as buying [hit some] pricing tiers during the quarter; and two, we returned to the trend of making gains on piracy, including in Asia. 
OEM revenue increased by 13%. The difference between OEM revenue and unit growth is due to three trends, which you are already well familiar: one, volume mix shift towards emerging markets, which generally have lower ASPs; two, channel mix shift towards large OEMs with volume pricing; and three, premium mix shift toward consumer premium offerings. Specifically, while business and consumer premium units were up year-on-year and the overall OEM premium mix remained unchanged from the prior year at 72%, the premium mix composition shifted down four points of business premium and up four points of consumer premium. 
The remaining roughly 20% of client revenue comes from commercial and retail licensing. This portion of the business grew over 20%, driven by continued strength in client annuity licensing as business customers continued to demand our enterprise offerings, including those that help them more efficiently manage their desktop infrastructure. 
During the quarter, we surpassed the 180 million for Windows Vista licenses sold to date and Windows Vista had driven client revenue to an average growth rate of 16% since it became generally available. 
Moving to server and tools, revenue was $3.7 billion, growing an outstanding 21% on top of the string of Q4 double-digit growth quarters. And this quarter marks the group’s 24th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. 
[inaudible] for annuity contracts, covering our [server and tools] offerings continued during the quarter, driving server and tools unearned revenues increased 37% from the beginning of the year. This customer commitment to annuity contracts demonstrates the increasingly critical role our server products perform in information technology infrastructure, as well as an increasing interest in the value offered in our long-term product roadmap. 
Demand for our consulting and support services remains strong, driving associated revenue growth of 30%. 
On the product side during the quarter, we released our eagerly anticipated virtualization feature, Hyper-V, two months ahead of schedule. We also made significant progress on SQL Server 2008, which is targeted for release during this, the first quarter of fiscal year 2009. 
Online services business grew revenue 24% to $838 million. Online advertising grew 18%, including $33 million of ad revenue from aQuantive. While both search queries and page views were up and in line with expectations, monetization lagged, driven by tightening advertising budgets combined with a more competitive display pricing environment. We continued to attract users to our properties with live IDs hitting 460 million, up 80 million from last year. And we grew the number of advertisers utilizing our advertising platform by 28% during the year. 
We closed the acquisitions of FairCast, which offers technology to aid in the purchase of online tickets at the lowest price, and Navic Networks, which develops tools to deliver targeted ads to television set-top boxes. 
In May, we announced the beta launch of Live Search Cashback. Since then, we have 680 merchants participating in the program with about 200,000 registered users. 
Microsoft business division revenue was up 14% to $5.3 billion. The business element of MBD revenue grew almost $700 million, or 19% on both strong enterprise agreement signings and license only sales. 
Consumer revenue declined $66 million, down 7%. This reflects both a difficult comparison to last year’s quarter following the Office 2007 launch, and a continuation of a shift towards our lower price consumer SKUs. 
Our emerging business product momentum continues, with SharePoint revenue up over 30% and unified communications revenue up over 20%. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Fast Search & Transfer, expanding our spectrum of enterprise search solutions for customers. 
Our Dynamics business also had a good quarter, with customer billings growth of 22% and two product releases, Dynamics AX2009 and Dynamics CRM Online. Dynamics CRM continues to deliver the function and flexibility customers want, evidenced by over 120,000 CRM seats being sold in the quarter. 
Entertainment and devices division grew revenues 37% to $1.6 billion. We sold 1.3 million Xbox 360 consoles, representing 88% growth over the prior year and passing the milestone of 20 million consoles sold life to date. In May, we announced that Xbox Live reached 12 million members, roughly doubling in membership for each of the last two years. Software attach rate continued to lead the industry at 7.7 software titles per console. 
As was evident at E3 earlier this week, the interactive entertainment business was extremely busy during the quarter, securing industry-leading media content providers such as Netflix, NBC, Universal, Constantine, MGM International, as well as developing innovative new gaming and social experiences that will continue to expand our audiences. 
The mobility business within the entertainment and devices division completed the acquisition of Danger and released System Center Mobile Device Manager 2008, which has created the opportunity for our sales force to partner with customers’ IT departments, helping them manage their mobile device assets with capabilities similar to those already used to manage PCs. 
And Microsoft Surface moved into early commercial deployment in AT&T stores and [inaudible], [as you know.]
Now for the rest of the income statement: adjusting last year for the impact of the $1.1 billion charge related to the expansion of the Xbox 360 warranty policy, cost of revenue as a percent of sales increased one point to 18%, driven by increasing Xbox 360 console sales, costs associated with the growth of our consulting and support services, as well as data center equipment and online content expenses in our online services business. 
Operating expenses increased $1.1 billion, or 19%, driven primarily by headcount related costs, acquisition related expenses, and marketing related expenses. Expenses came in $500 million higher than our guidance, split rather evenly between cost of revenue and operating expenses. 
First, cost of revenue; we sold more Xbox 360 consoles than our guidance had reflected. In server and tools, the higher revenue growth in our consulting and support services carries higher associated costs than does software revenue. In our online services business, we were able to bring servers in our data centers online faster than expected and we invested in premium online content, which is [higher creative and agency fees associated with it]. 
Moving on to operating expenses, we took advantage of the economic environment out there to attract top talent for the company, yielding higher close rates and filling headcount openings. Also, across a number of our businesses, we spent more on product development and efforts to ready marketing campaigns, and foreign currency rates presented some headwind. 
Operating income was $5.7 billion, up 42% or 13% after adjusting for the impacts of the warranty related charge in the year-ago period. Investment income and other totaled $284 million, as the Microsoft treasury team continues to successfully navigate a challenging capital market environment. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 28%, a couple points lower than expected, driven by an earnings mix increase in lower tax jurisdictions. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 171 million shares, or almost $5 billion of company stock, and paid out about $1 billion in dividends to shareholders. 
Diluted shares outstanding were $9.4 billion, down 3% from the prior year, as a result of share repurchases. Earnings per share were $0.46, in line with our guidance and growing 48%, or 18% after adjusting for the warranty related charge in the prior year. 
So in summary, we had our fastest growing fourth quarter revenue since 1999. Adjusting of the year-ago Xbox warranty charge, operating income and EPS grew 13% and 18% respectively. 
With that, let me turn it back to Chris who will provide you with our first quarter and full year guidance for fiscal 2009. 
Christopher P. Liddell
Thanks, Colleen. I’m going to spend my remaining time on the call talking about what we see coming for the full year and for the first quarter. Let me begin by outlining some of our key assumptions around the economy and general demand in the industry. The forecast generally assumes a continuation of the economic conditions and demand we experienced in the fourth quarter to continue into the first half of fiscal year ’09, with some improvement over the second half of the year. 
We expect PC unit to remain healthy with growth rates similar to those in 2008. Specifically, we expect PC unit growth in fiscal 2009 to be 12% to 14% for the year and between 10% to 12% for the first quarter. We estimate that growth rates will continue to be driven by roughly 20% growth in emerging markets, with high-single-digit growth in mature markets. 
Now let me go through our detailed guidance; for the full year, we expect our revenue to come in between $67.3 billion to $68.1 billion, growing 11% to 13%. For the first quarter, we expect revenue of $14.7 billion to $14.9 billion, which represents an increase of 7% to 8%. 
With that, revenue guidance by business group is as follows: for client, we expect full year growth to be 9% to 10% and Q1 growth to be 6% to 7%. The PC market growth will outpace that of client revenue because of a continuation of the underlying PC market dynamic, namely emerging market PC growth outpacing mature markets, consumer growth exceeding business growth, and the shift in the system build channel to large OEM. 
Server and tools revenue should be up 18% to 19% for the year and 19% to 20% for the first quarter. Coming off another impressive year of growth in fiscal year ’08, the server and tools business is expected to continue to show double-digit growth across the breadth of our server platform products and services, driven by strong customer demand for the recently refreshed Windows Server and Digital Studio offerings, and the soon-to-be-available SQL Server 2008. 
We forecast revenue in the online services business to increase 18% to 20% for the year, and 7% to 11% for the first quarter. The advertising component of revenue is expected to grow at approximately 25% for the year and 15% for the quarter. 
Our Q1 guidance assumes the continuation of the challenging online advertising market experienced in the fourth quarter. We expect revenue growth will accelerate through the year as we begin seeing returns from the additional investments we are making in the business. 
Our business division revenue should be up 14% to 15% for the year and 15% to 16% in the first quarter. We should continue to see business demand for Microsoft Office 2007, SharePoint, and Dynamic products. Combined with growth in our emerging unified communication and business intelligence offering, this will drive another year of very strong growth. 
Fiscal 2009 also represents an important year in delivering on our software for services strategy, with the upcoming releases of Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and Office Communications Online later this calendar year. 
For the entertainment and devices division, we expect revenue to be down 4% to flat for the full year, and down 23% to 26% in Q1. The strong customer demand for Halo 3 following its launch in fiscal 2008 makes for challenging year-over-year comparisons in the entertainment and devices division. But having said that, we remain committed to a profitable performance in fiscal year ’09. 
Turning back to company wide performance, operating income for the year is expected to be between $26.3 billion and $26.9 billion, increasing 17% to 20%, or 10% to 12% excluding certain tax and legal charges in fiscal 2008. For the first quarter, we expect operating income to be between $5.9 billion and $6 billion. 
Q1 operating income includes the impact of increased spending associated with our online services business, costs associated with a number of new acquisitions, and investments in a new Windows consumer marketing campaign. 
I would like to address the overall level of -- the impact of the overall level of spending on the company margin. To do so, as I’ve told you before, we need to look at the three individual parts of the company that have distinct margin structures. The core businesses of client, server and tools, and Microsoft business division collectively will have an operating margin in fiscal 2009 that’s essentially flat. This performance is obviously very good, given that we are making a number of investments to drive the overall health of the business and absorbing a number of acquisitions we’ve made this year and growing revenue in mid-teens. 
The margin for entertainment and devices should also remain roughly the same year-on-year in fiscal year ’09, even without a first party game release of Halo 3’s magnitude. 
So taken together, our businesses representing over 90% of our revenue will grow double-digits next year with the margin structure intact. 
Clearly the online services business has a totally different dynamic and is in a period of significant investment. We do not make these investments lightly, as the loss in this division will be a drag on an otherwise exceptionally good performance. 
However, we believe that the additional investments of several hundreds of millions of dollars is worth the short-term cost, given the opportunity to participate in a market where the opportunity is measured in the tens of billions of dollars. 
So I wanted on the call to take a few minutes to frame our reasoning behind the additional online service business investments. I will start with an overview of our broad strategy and then provide details into the additional investments. 
With the online ad spending expected to reach $80 billion by 2012, this area represents one of the largest growth opportunities for the company. We segment the market for online advertising in four distinct categories -- search, advertising platforms, information content, and communication and social networking. 
For search, we’re focused on driving query share improvements and business model innovation, specifically in the area of high value commercial search. Our recent release of Cashback is a good example of executing on our strategy, which combines innovation in the shopping experience with a shift in the distribution of advertiser economic towards the end users. 
Additionally, we also [seek to win] targeted distribution through OEMs, ISPs, ISVs, and retailers. The recently announced deal with HP in the U.S. is an example of [this]. 
Turning to the ad platform, our strategy can be summarized as consolidate [when in] display, and there we are focused on integrating our advertising assets into a single comprehensive system that can deliver our publishing partners’ industry leading yields and our advertisers optimal return on their ad spend. 
In the area of communication and social networking, which includes our mail, messenger, and social networking assets, such as Spaces, we’ll deliver the leading end-to-end experiences across the PC, phone, and web. 
And finally, in the category of information content, we plan to invigorate our MSN portal experience with improvements in user experience, social media consumption, and premium content. 
As well as overall advertising revenue, which is clearly the overall measure of success, we have aggressive growth targets in each of the above areas over the next five to 10 years. These targets can be broken down in terms of the percentage of share of worldwide page views, percentage of share of Internet [inaudible], the percentage share of search queries, and percentage of the growth of the online advertising dollars that pass through our platform. 
Clearly the Yahoo! transaction, which I’ll make some more comments on later, would have accelerated our progress towards these goals. However, during the quarter, a transaction became increasingly unlikely. Further, as you know, during the quarter Yahoo! signed a search outsourcing agreement with Google. Given that environment, we made some decisions to accelerate our online services’ organic growth strategy. Mainly we decided to increase our investment in the high-margin scalable areas of search and ad platforms. 
So about two-thirds of the incremental spend that we are planning is related to investments to drive usage of our search offering. We’re dialing up our search distribution initiatives with targeted OEM toolbar [alt] search deals, scaling search globally with investments in localized engineering and data centers, pursuing acquisitions and partnerships to build vertical content to support our commercial strategy, accelerating the rollout of our Cashback program, and increasing marketing in the business to grow awareness and drive traffic. 
Second, we are upping the investments in our ad platform and increasing the number of advertisers and high quality inventory on that platform. Specifically, these investments are in the area of accelerating the integration of our ad platform assets, expanding our sales and service capabilities, small acquisitions to enhance the platform technology, and investments in strategic partnerships to increase third-party inventory available to advertisers on our ad platform. 
So turning to EPS, our diluted earnings per share for the year are expected to come in at $2.12 to $2.18, representing growth of 13% to 17%, two to four points faster than revenue. 
To put this performance in context, as I mentioned at the front of the call, if we achieve the middle of our guidance, we’ll have increased earnings per share from $1.42 to $2.15 in two years, an increase of 50%. But first quarter we expect earnings per share of $0.47 to $0.48, and these earnings assume an effective tax rate of 28%. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we expect total unearned revenue to finish fiscal 2009 up 8% to 9%. [Contracts not filled] should also finish 2009 up from current levels. 
When thinking about sequential changes in unearned revenue from Q4 fiscal year ’08 to Q1 fiscal year ’09, we expect a sequential decrease from Q4 to Q1 to exceed the rate of decline we experienced the last few years. 
As always, when thinking about the guidance we provide, you should also consider the risks. These include competitors, legal, execution and general market risks such as foreign exchange rate movements, fluctuations in PC and server hardware growth rates, IT spending, changes in the piracy rate, and customer acceptance of our new and existing products. Additionally, changes in the mix of our billings between annuity and license only can have an impact on revenue, operating income, and EPS by delaying revenue recognition into future periods. 
So in closing, the strong results of fiscal year ’08 were the outcome of both business and engineering execution. In addition to the financial out-performance, we delivered the final phase in our multi-year product refresh cycle with the availability of Windows Server 2008 and Visual Studio 2008, and are well-positioned to continue that momentum into fiscal 2009. 
The next fiscal year will be an important year, driving mass adoption across the portfolio of products. With our breadth of products and global diversification, we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver double-digit revenue increases even off our base of over $60 billion, and we will continue to use our strong cash flow to invest in our organic growth, inorganic growth through acquisitions, and in ourselves through buy-backs. 
Before I hand the call back to Colleen, I want to take a moment to clarify the terms of our recent proposal for a search transaction with Yahoo!. Given the upcoming Yahoo! shareholder meeting, I won’t be taking any questions on this topic in the Q&A section that will follow this presentation and we won’t be providing any additional comments on matters we’ve already discussed. But with that, let me outline for you the key elements of our proposal. 
Firstly, we are providing significant revenue guarantees. Microsoft proposed a 10-year minimum revenue guarantee totaling between $19.5 billion and $26.5 billion. For the first five years, the guarantee is $2.3 billion per year. There afterwards, both Yahoo! and Microsoft have the option to extend the agreement for an additional five-year period. If Yahoo! unilaterally chooses to extend the agreement, the guarantee would be for $1.6 billion per year after the extension. Conversely, if Microsoft unilaterally chooses to extend the agreement, the guarantee to Yahoo! would be $3 billion per year after the extension. These guarantees are not conditional on Yahoo!’s search queries, but rather the guarantees are tied to Yahoo!’s homepage performance. 
Our proposal includes an 85% TAC rate for the first three years of the agreement and 70% there afterwards. Microsoft would pay Yahoo! $1 billion for its search assets, provide $2.8 billion of senior debt to Yahoo! on favorable terms, and make a significant equity investment in Yahoo! through the purchase of $3.9 billion of Yahoo! stock at $19.50 per share, reflecting our view of the value of the company as a result of our proposed transaction and the distribution of cash and the Yahoo! Asian investments by Yahoo! to its stockholders. 
I should also note that Microsoft’s proposal did not and does not include changes to Yahoo!’s governance. We clearly continue to believe that our proposal is a compelling one. 
With that, I am going to hand the call back to Colleen so we can get started taking your questions, and I clearly look forward to seeing a number of you at our financial analyst meeting, which is next Thursday. 
Colleen Healy
Thanks, Chris. Let’s now proceed to questions. We want to accommodate questions from as many people as possible, so please avoid multi-part questions and limit yourselves to just one question. Operator, will you please repeat your instructions?
Question-and-Answer Session

Operator
(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Sara Friar with Goldman Sachs.
Sara Friar - Goldman Sachs
Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Chris, just firstly, could you give us a little bit of your overview on the macro environment and how that’s changed when you think back to giving earnings three months ago? And then, just on your cash flow, it came in a little weaker than we were anticipating. DSOs were up higher than we have seen in perhaps ever for Microsoft. Was there a collections issue, more back-end loading? If you could perhaps talk to the weakness there.
Christopher P. Liddell
Sure. Okay, taking those in turn, in terms of the macro environment, it’s broadly speaking the same as what we were expecting in April. Clearly people are getting concerned now about the length of softness here in the U.S., but as you’ve seen for revenue, we’ve taken it up slightly since April, so in terms of the visibility into our products, we are actually feeling very good about our position, not only here in the U.S. but outside the U.S. 
I mentioned in my comments, if you look at the company overall, our sales in the U.S. in the year that we just completed were up 15%. The company overall is up 18% so clearly we grew faster outside the U.S. than we did inside the U.S., but at 15%, given it’s been a difficult environment for a number of companies, growing at 15% off our base was very good. 
So going into next year, we are clearly cautious like everyone is about the impact of the environment but for our products overall, we are feeling very good. I’d say the one proviso to that is in the online advertising space, where we are seeing a direct impact. It was weak in the fourth quarter and I think you are seeing from results of other companies as to the weakness in that general space. So there is a direct impact and we are not immune to that in the online space and we’ll probably see that continuing certainly for the next quarter. But overall in terms of our core business growth, it feels very good. 
In terms of your other questions on cash flow, the biggest thing in the cash flow that was probably a negative was the payment of the fine to the E.U., which was over $1 billion, so -- $1.5 billion, so that was clearly a big negative from a cash flow point of view. Other than that, there really wasn’t anything remarkable from a cash flow point of view. In fact, it was quite a strong quarter, given the results overall. 
Colleen Healy
And on a DSO standpoint, Q4 seasonally does tend to be a little higher than some of the other quarters. We do close a lot of business in our fiscal Q4 as the sale force is out there closing deals. But we didn’t see anything unusual from a DSO standpoint. 
Christopher P. Liddell
But overall, I’d say revenue growth of 18% last year, guiding to revenue growth of 11% to 13%, so you combine those and so that’s 30% broadly for the two years that cover what was hopefully the worst of the economic condition, so we’re feeling good about it. 
Sara Friar - Goldman Sachs
Okay. And there were -- okay, thanks. 
Colleen Healy
Okay, thanks, Sara. Next question, please. 
Operator
The next question comes from Heather Bellini with UBS.
Heather Bellini - UBS
Good afternoon. I was just wondering, Chris, if you could talk a little bit about the OSB business. Given how far behind you guys are, if you’re unsuccessful in getting all or even a part of Yahoo!, can you walk us through how you are going to be able to compete with Google? And also, are we in a critical period here in this segment where if you continue to go down the path of going it alone that we are going to be seeing this accelerating spending from current levels so that it’s going to adversely impact overall op-margin, so we’re actually not going to see op-margins expand for the next few years? Thanks. 
Christopher P. Liddell
Sure. Okay, overall, clearly regardless of what happens with Yahoo!, it’s a space that we’re committed to. I said that in the prepared remarks and it’s one that we’re committed to on a long-term basis. I would split the market, as I did in my prepared remarks, into four areas, of which search is only one -- ad platform, communications, central networking, and information content being the other ones, and clearly we have a very good position in information content and communications in an ad platform with the acquisition of aQuantive. So we feel very good about our relative position in those areas and a number of our investments are going into that. 
In the search area, clearly that’s the one where, relatively speaking, we are the most behind and that’s why we’re taking a different approach, which again I mentioned in the prepared remarks where we are focusing in particular on the areas of search where there’s a strong commercial intent, our verticals like retail, travel, real estate, local. We’re looking at different approaches where we might potentially take a disruptive and innovative business model, for example, Cashback, and then looking at winning distribution deals. 
Now in the short-term, that isn’t going to make the division profitable and I think clearly from our guidance, that’s not the case. So as I said in the remarks, if you look at the operating margin structure of the company, you really have to look at the three distinct businesses. We feel good about the margin structure for our core businesses in particular growing double-digit revenue on. Entertainment and devices will be broadly flat but online is going to be negative -- 
Heather Bellini - UBS
Chris, yeah, I totally get what you are saying. I guess the question that I’m getting asked a lot is how long are you going to spend -- you are obviously performing well on the top line but your spending the upside so that people aren’t getting margin expansion. I guess the question that I’m getting asked is how long should we expect that to continue? 
Christopher P. Liddell
We’re not going to make -- certainly on this call we’re not going to give guidance for fiscal year ’10 and ’11. Some of these investments that we are making will be multi-year, so it will depend to a large extent on our revenue growth as to when that division becomes profitable. So it will need to continue to grow relatively substantially in order to cover the level of investments that we are making, but it is going to be, and I think we’ve made this point on previous calls, it is going to be an investment [in the] area, in particular things like the ad platform, where we see it converging to two natural players over time, of which we clearly would expect to be one, and that’s an area where spending in particular on infrastructure is likely to be high. 
So I can’t promise you that you are going to see a massive turnaround in the short-term, and certainly in fiscal year ’09, which is the year that we are guiding to today, it is going to be a continuation of an investment. But again, put it in the context of what we would describe as the overall opportunity and the size of the company overall. 
Heather Bellini - UBS
Thank you. 
Colleen Healy
Thanks, Heather. Next question, please. 
Operator
The next question comes from Charles Di Bona with Sanford Bernstein.
Charles Di Bona - Sanford C. Bernstein
I would like to circle back to the Q4 results and really particularly the margins here -- I think the Xbox issue is fairly straightforward but in something like five of the last eight Q4s, you guys have had an issue about being disappointing on margins, and maybe you can give us some color and comfort on what sort of looks to be a fairly persistent control issue in Q4, and in some cases it looks like you might be pulling some of the expenses forward. Are we going to see that in the fiscal ’09 numbers?
Christopher P. Liddell
I always distinguish, Charlie, between the costs, which were, if you like, a function of the revenue, a function of decisions that we made, and functions of unexpected low quality spend, if you like. But I can give you some comfort -- it’s the areas that we spent more of in the fourth quarter were more [inaudible] in the first two. For example, on the revenue side, we sold more Xboxes, so we had more COGS. That’s good news, okay? We don’t make any money from those but overall in terms of long-term health of the business, the more consoles we sell, the better. 
In server and tools, the higher enterprise services revenue carries higher COGS with it -- again, that’s just a factor of it. So the mix inside server and tools might not be as strong as you would like from a revenue point of view, but that’s just a natural consequence. 
In terms of decisions that we made, we have budgeted headcount and people hired to their budgeted levels. That’s a good thing in the sense that we actually hired people that we want to hire and we were particularly successful. I think that’s a reflection to a large extent of the economic environment and the fact that if anything at the moment, we are an even more attractive company than we have been to people. 
So again, that hits us from an expense point of view, but I’d describe it in one of the categories, you know, it’s a conscious decision to hire people. 
In terms of things that were outside our control, FX was a factor. FX has been our friend pretty much throughout the year in terms of driving more revenue upside than more expense, net net it’s been a positive, clearly because we have more revenue outside the U.S. than we do expenses. In the fourth quarter, it was an unusual quarter in that we hired a lot of people outside the U.S. and the mix of expenses was such that the FX impact was higher on OpEx than it was on revenue. If you look across the year, that’s not the case but in the quarter, it was. 
So I’m comfortable that there’s not any lack of control over spending. Most of the decisions I’ve talked about were either conscious ones or were a reflection of better revenue performance in certain areas. 
Colleen Healy
Great, thanks, Charlie. Next question, please. 
Operator
The next question comes from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.
Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch
Thank you very much. It looks like stepping up investments in the online services business seems like the right thing to do. I’m just curious, Chris, what -- I would have expected that to be accompanied by an increase to the revenue guidance, yet when you look back over the last 12 months, if I exclude aQuantive, I still come up with much faster revenue growth in the online services business. So my question is, is the return on these investments going to take more than one year sort of a lag to show up in the financials, or is there some conservatism in how you are budgeting for the revenue productivity as a result of these investments? Is there a longer lag to these OpEx investments?
And also, maybe three of our seconds of your thoughts on client guidance. I know Colleen didn’t want multi-part questions, but I couldn’t resist this; the 6% to 7% growth absent currency looks to be very low on the 2% to 3%, so I’m just curious what was the thought process that went into that guidance as well. Thanks. 
Christopher P. Liddell
Okay, sure. Kash, you went blank through the start of your question, so if I don’t cover it exactly, please come back to me. We missed just the first few words of your question, but in terms of online spending, is it likely to be more of a fiscal year ’10 impact on revenue? The answer is yes, and that’s not only because of the nature of some of the investments that we are making. Things like marketing Cashback, that’s going to take time in terms of seeing the real impact from that. 
But also, just because -- as I mentioned I think to Sara’s question, the online advertising area is probably the part of the business certainly in the short-term which we think is most challenging. From an economic environment point of view, we have actually done remarkably well in our commercial businesses and overall for PCs, getting through difficult and choppy economic waters. The online advertising area is very difficult at the moment and I think that’s across the board. That’s not just us, so I don’t want to promise -- you know, we might see benefits, for example, in share but I’m not sure that share is necessarily [in best display] in the search area. Again, it translates in the -- certainly in the first six months and possibly across the year to significant revenue growth but I think you could expect to see us make progress in the areas that I talked about, which is the underlying dynamics, the driver of the -- percentage minutes, percentage share, et cetera. That’s really how we are going to have to measure ourselves over the next year. 
I think the second half of your question was client-specific, is that right?
Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch
That’s correct, yes. 
Christopher P. Liddell
In the 6% to 7%, yeah, that is relatively light. To some extent, it’s because of the very high, strong quarter one that we had last year. If you’ll recall, we had a very strong quarter one piracy performance in last year. It’s also part of the strong Q4 performance from this year, which Colleen mentioned in the prepared remarks, was some channel inventory. We -- if you like, it was a very strong unit growth in quarter four fiscal year ’08. Some of that was because of a weak Q3. You’ll recall our Q3 call, we talked about some of the inventory issues there and that was one of the reasons why Q3 of last year was weak. So it feels like a bit of a borrowing from Q3 into Q4, and also we think a little bit of some of our customers may have bought forward from Q1 into Q4 as well, so that’s one of the reasons. 
The other is we’ve got 10% to 12% PC unit growth expectation, which relative to the year of 12% to 14%, we’re just seeing that quarter as being one of the low points. So you combine all of those factors and we think that’s going to be the lowest revenue growth quarter for client in the year.

Great, thanks a lot, Kash. Next question, please.

The next question comes from Brent Thill with Citigroup.
Brent Thill - Citigroup
Thanks. Chris, the overall buy-back for ’08 was more than cut in half from ’07. Obviously that’s understandable considering the acquisition strategy, but I guess as it relates to the overall plan, you only have $3 billion left on the current $36 billion plan. How aggressive at 25 and change will you be with the stock here?
Christopher P. Liddell
Okay, yeah -- going backwards and then going forwards, backwards -- yes, you are right, it was lower than the previous year. One of the reasons for that is we were getting down to a level of cash that we feel more comfortable with, so there was some accelerated buying in the previous year. The other impact was we see that the aQuantive acquisition, which was relatively expensive this year, and the last factor is when we announced the Yahoo! acquisition earlier this year, we went out of the market but from a sensitivity point of view, and clearly at that stage we’re envisaging having to use a large part of that cash for the acquisition. Subsequent to May when it was clear that the overall transaction wasn’t going to happen, we went back into the market and we have been buying at levels that are more like historic levels. So those are the reasons why we’ve been less in the year. It was $5 billion I believe for the quarter, so it was a reasonably strong buy-back quarter. 
Clearly at these prices, it’s incredibly attractive from a buy-back perspective. I can’t tell you, as I never do on a quarter by quarter basis exactly how much we will buy back. You’re right that we only have about $3 billion worth of our buy-back left. That’s good news in the sense that I think we gave ourselves until 2012 to complete it, so we can put it at a little ahead of schedule. 
What we do here is we complete the current buy-back, and then we go back to the board for authorization of any subsequent buy-back, and that would be exactly the process that we do here and if and when we get authorization from the board to do further buy-backs, we’d clearly announce the amount at that stage. But similarly wouldn’t announce exactly the shape of what we do. But clearly the value of the company relative to the last three years is as good as it’s been. 
Colleen Healy
Thanks a lot, Brent. Next question, please.

The next question comes from Adam Holt from Morgan Stanley. 
Adam Holt - Morgan Stanley
Good afternoon. I have a question about Office and MBD. Obviously Office 2007 has been a terrific product cycle, but MBD has been a little bit light relative to guidance for the last couple of quarters. Could you maybe talk about where you think we are in the Office 2007 cycle, and what gives you confidence that we’ll see a reacceleration of growth in MBD next year versus what we saw in the back half of this year?
Christopher P. Liddell
Well overall, obviously the MBD division did extremely well last year, so put that in context but you’re right in the sense that Office was slightly lighter than we might have thought, mainly to be honest in the consumer area, and that’s around lower price SKUs in retail. So we’re seeing more of a buy from the volume that we’re seeing. The volumes are very good and business sales are very good but the volumes in the retail side tend to be more in the lower priced SKUs, so that’s having an impact overall. But the overall volume and the overall adoption and reaction to Office 2007 has been extremely good, so we feel good and we’ve put it inside our business group, which grew at 15% to 20% last year. 
Adam Holt - Morgan Stanley
So as we look at it next year, should we be thinking about dynamics and share points being the key drivers, or should we expect office to reaccelerate? 
Christopher P. Liddell
I think those emerging products are certainly going to make a big difference. We’re guiding 14% to 15%. That’s very good. I mean, Office is unlikely to grow at 14% to 15%. It’s likely to grow at more like high to single digits. But the other parts of the business will grow extremely well, and that is going to average it up to 14% to 15%, so you’re right. SharePoint, Office Communications, some of the online services that we are bringing in will start to have an impact. So overall, it’s now our biggest division in terms of revenue, 14% to 15% looks very good. 

Adam Holt - Morgan Stanley
Terrific. Thank you. 
Colleen Healy
Thanks, Adam. Our next question, please.

The next question comes from Robert Breza with RBC. 
Robert Breza - RBC Capital Markets
Just looking at the $500 million in expenses that you are talking about, how should we think about that trending through the year? And then, depending on any outcome from an acquisition perspective, would you look to accelerate that investment or decelerate that investment? Thanks. 
Christopher P. Liddell
It has slightly different dynamics. In terms of the consumer marketing, that’s probably going to be front loaded in the year, and one of the reasons for our first quarter being relatively light compared to the other quarters would be some of the marketing spend that we see in the first quarter. 
In terms of some of the online spending, that’s probably going to be more progressive through the year. In terms of acquisitions, that’s really going to be opportunistic. We closed a lot in the fourth quarter, and one of the things that is impacting our results is clearly the amount of non-cash amortization associated with acquisitions, and that was relatively substantial last year. It was over $300 million. We don’t call that out, as some companies do, and take the benefit of adjusting our results to reflect that. We take that probably through the P&L and next year in terms of the guidance we’ve given you, we expect it to be more than $300 million. How much more and exactly the shape will depend on acquisitions. We have an expectation of it that we build in and -- but it will grow progressively through the year. It’s all non-cash but we’ll continue to take the full impact through the P&L. 
Robert Breza - RBC Capital Markets
That’s helpful. Thank you. 
Colleen Healy
Thanks, Robert, and our last question, please, Operator.

The last question comes from Kirk Materne with Banc of America Securities. 
Kirk Materne - Banc of America
Thanks very much. Chris, you talked in the guidance just on entertainment and devices about maintaining profitability. Given that there’s no sort of new cycle of the hardware this year, is there any reason why profitability shouldn’t start to trend up as attach rates get better? Is there anything going on in that business that’s going to require say more advertising dollars or spending in that?
Christopher P. Liddell
One of the impacts obviously as we dropped prices during the course of last year, so year-on-year we have slightly difficult price comparisons. The other thing is there’s more than just X-Box sitting in there. There’s obviously Windows Mobile, which has got a lot of opportunities, so there are other areas that we will be spending on. We aren’t in the comments of today giving any guidance on profitability. My comment was simply that it will sustainable profitability, but we’re not saying whether that’s going to be significantly up or down from where it was last year. 
Kirk Materne - Banc of America
Okay. Thanks very much.

Okay with that, let me now turn it over to Chris.
Chris Liddell
Thanks Colleen and good afternoon everyone. The sense of our third quarter results demonstrates the benefits of our diversified business model. As you will see our broad span across geographies, product categories and customer segments is a tremendous asset in any economic environment and produced third quarter results of 14% revenue growth normalized for the tech guarantee and 27% earnings per share adjusted for the tech guarantee, legal charges and tax benefits beating our earnings per share guidance by $0.02 to $0.04. 
Let me mention a few highlights about third quarter performance before turning to guidance. When looking at the drivers of revenue growth this quarter it’s clear that we are reaping the benefits of the diversification of our business. In the first two quarters of the year our core business of client and the Microsoft business division significantly outperformed our expectations and this quarter entertainment and devices division drove our results.
Despite the tough economic environment this has allowed us to deliver consecutive earnings per share growth of 29%, 32% and 27% this year adjusted for the tech guarantee, legal charges and tax benefits. Revenue growth in the client and Microsoft business division businesses were normalized for the prior year results for the impacts of the tech guarantee and retail launch spikes had combined growth of $700 million or 9%.
Server and tools had yet another quarter of double-digit revenue growth while kicking off our largest enterprise product launch in the company’s history. Our consumer businesses of entertainment and devices division and online service business grew revenue of combined 57% or over $850 million. And the treasury department continued to take some work delivering investment income exceeding our forecast and managing to avoid any significant write-offs in our portfolio despite the [massive] dislocation in the financial markets. 
In the fourth quarter we expect a strong finish to what has been an excellent year. Revenue, operating income and earnings per share guidance for the year remain largely in line with our January guidance and significantly above our expectations upon entering the year. Since this time last year our revenue outlook for fiscal year ’08 has increased by about $3 billion, operating income margins are expected to expand by over a point and earnings per share guidance is higher by $0.18. 
On a more macro level there has been some uncertainty regarding the strength of the IT spending environment but our business has remained robust in the face of that uncertainty. While clearly no business can be immune from the impact of an economic slowdown, we remain confident in the benefits of our diversified business model and the investment approach we have taken in recent years. 
We’ve delivered earnings per share results above the high end of our guidance every quarter this year and have raised our full year earnings per share guidance in each quarter. We are not expecting earnings per share growth of 33% to 35% this year normalized for legal charges and tax benefit which is an outstanding achievement in the current economic environment. 
With those high level themes I’m going to turn over the call to Colleen for more details of our third quarter performance.
Colleen Heally
Thanks Chris. It was an excellent quarter with normalized revenue and operating income growth of 14% and 15% respectively. Normalized EPS growth at 27% was five points above high end guidance. Revenue growth was driven by continued enterprise customer demand for our core products as well as consumer demand for products and services in the entertainment and devices division and our online services business. Let me provide you with details of our financial performance starting with revenue. I’ll discuss top line financial and business momentum points and then follow with revenue performance for each of the business units. Then I’ll review the rest of the income statement. All growth comparisons relate to the comparable quarter of last year unless otherwise specified.
Revenue was $14.5 billion. Adjusting the year-ago quarter by the $1.7 billion of revenue recognition primarily related to the technology guarantee programs from Windows Vista and Office 2007 total revenue grew 14%. We estimate PC unit growth rates moderated from our January expectations by a couple of points in mature markets partially offset by an extra point of strength in emerging markets resulting in an estimate of approximately 8% to 10% for the entire PC market during the quarter. 
Our mix of product billings for the quarter was approximately 30% from OEMs, 30% from multi-year agreements, 25% from license only sales and the balance from our other businesses. Annuity sales mix continued to increase on both a year-over-year and sequential basis while enterprise agreement renewal rates were in line with historical trends. As we guided our unearned revenue balance was consistent with historical seasonality patterns and remained roughly flat on a sequential basis at $12.1 billion up 18% year-over-year. 
Our contracted not billed balance remains above $11.5 billion and increased sequentially up well over $1 billion from where we started the fiscal year. When taken together with reported revenue total bookings for the company grew 14%. Now I will provide revenue highlights by business segment starting with clients.
Client revenue of $4 billion was down 24% or down 2% adjusted for the tech guarantees. Adjusting that further for a retail launch bump from last year client revenue would have been up 4%. Let’s break down the main drivers behind client revenue first for OEM license units and then for OEM revenue. During the quarter our OEM license units increased by 5%, about four points than the overall hardware market. We believe this reversal of the OEM unit trend outpacing that of the PC market was primarily driven by three factors. One, last year OEMs particularly in the system builder channel rebuilt inventory levels following the launch of Windows Vista driving OEM unit growth over 20% during that quarter and making it a tough comp. Two, inventory levels at our OEM partners this year were higher than normal exiting fiscal Q2 impacting this quarter’s purchases. Three, we believe there was an increase in shipments of unlicensed PCs particularly in Asia. While we generally feel good about the gains we are making in piracy for the year, piracy is a tough battle in an area where we will need to continue investing in order to make progress.
Looking past the individual quarters, PC market growth was up 12% to 14% year to date with OEM license units growing about a point faster which is in line with our historical rate of progress against piracy. OEM revenue declined 25% but grew a point when normalized for the tech guarantees in the prior year. The four percentage difference between OEM license unit growth and revenue growth was caused by two roughly equivalent factors; mainly the increasing volume in emerging markets and a channel shift to large OEMs from the system builder channel. Partially offsetting these impacts was in increase in premium mix. Premium mix grew five points during the quarter to 76% driven by an increase in the consumer element of the mix while the business portion was unchanged.
The remaining roughly 20% of client revenue comes from the commercial and retail licensing portion of the business which declined 18% or was down 13% after adjusting for tech guarantees. Normalizing last year’s Windows Vista launch bump at approximately $225 million growth would have been up 23%. We continue to see healthy growth in the commercial portion of the business as sales of software assurance were once again strong as evidenced by the 29% in the client volume licensing portion of the unearned revenue balance. Since the launch of Windows Vista revenue for the client business has grown 16% with a license growth rate of one to two points above that of the PC hardware market. Over 140 million licenses of Windows Vista have been sold to date and Service Pack 1 was released in the quarter.
Moving to server and tools, revenue of $3.3 billion represented an increase of 18% marking its 23rd consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Customers continue to gravitate towards premium versions of Windows Server and SQL Server as well as to annuity contracts. The increased billing mix of annuity contracts drove the unearned revenue balance for the division up by over 35% versus last year. Our consulting and support services revenue increased 24% as we’ve experienced high demand following the recent launches across our product lines. The third quarter also marked the launch activities of the new versions of our flagship products in the server and tools division, namely Windows Server 2008, SQL Server 2008 and Visual Studio 2008. These products bring powerful new tools to our customers and partners looking to turn their IT departments into a strategic asset.
For example Windows Server 2008 with virtualization technology will help customers increase reliability and flexibility of their server infrastructure, reduce costs and increase security.
Online services business grew revenue 40% to $843 million this included $143 million from the addition of aQuantive. Online advertising grew 39% or was up 29% excluding the $47 million of ad revenue from aQuantive. Our online audience continues to grow. Live IDs increased to 18% to 448 million while usage deepened with search queries and page views up from the prior year. In the quarter we announced a number of acquisitions including Caligari for collaborative 3D modeling, YaData for customer micro segment management, and Rapt for behavioral targeting. And of course in February we proposed to purchase Yahoo. Chris will go into more detail about Yahoo later in the call.
Microsoft business division revenue was $4.7 billion down 2% but up 9% adjusted for tech guarantees in fiscal year 2008. Adjusted for last year’s retail launch bump of about $150 million revenue would have grown 13% with business customer revenue growth of 17%. Our expanded portfolio of productivity products are thriving with share point revenue up over 35%, unified communications up over 20% and dynamic customer billings up 13%. On the strategic front we announced the acquisition of FAST Search and Transfer to enhance our enterprise search offerings. During the quarter we also held our SharePoint and Convergent conferences which both saw record attendance by customers and partners. And we expanded on our software plus services vision by announcing that the Beta of SharePoint online and exchange online will be opened to companies of all sizes.
Entertainment and devices division grew revenue of 68% to $1.6 billion over $300 million above our high end guidance driven by the sale of 1.3 million Xbox 360 consoles. High holiday demand for Xbox 360 consoles during the preceding quarter in which Xbox 360 outsold PlayStation 3 by over 1 million units in the US led to a short channel inventory for much of this quarter. However according to US MPG data by March Xbox 360 had reclaimed its monthly console sales lead over the PS3. With retail inventory restored to more healthy levels Xbox 360 is well positioned as the industry anticipates next week’s launch of Grand Theft Auto 4. During the quarter we announced the acquisition of Danger which closed last week and announced the November target release date for Gears of War the highly anticipated sequel to the fastest selling video game of 2007.
Now for the rest of the income statement. Cost of revenue increased by $370 million primarily driven by higher Xbox 360 console sales, growth in our consulting business, and expansion of data center operations and the addition of aQuantive costs. After adjusting the year-ago quarter for the impact of tech guarantees cost of revenue held flat at 17% of sales. Operating expenses increased almost $1.9 billion or up 33% primarily due to $1.4 billion of legal charges relating to the European commission fine assessed in February. Adjusting for that charge in the current quarter and $150 million of legal charges in the same quarter of last year, operating expenses increased $600 million, up 11%. 
This is favorable to our expectations due to lower headcount driven costs and some shift of marketing expense into the fourth quarter. Operating income was $4.4 billion. After adjusting for the impact of tech guarantees and legal charges, operating income grew 15%, one point faster than revenue growth. Investment income and other totaled $401 million for the quarter as the treasury team continued to do an outstanding job in challenging capital markets. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 9%. During the quarter we settled a 2000 to 2003 examination with the IRS. As a result we reduced our previously accrued tax provision by $1.4 billion which was partially offset by the non-tax deductibility of the European commission fines resulting in our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter of 29%. 
During the quarter we repurchased 30 million shares or $1 billion of company stock and paid out over $1 billion in dividends to shareholders. Diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 9.4 billion down 4% from the prior year as a result of share repurchases. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.47 which was $0.02 to $0.04 above our guidance after adjusting for the offsetting impacts of the $0.15 EPS charge from the European commission fine and the $0.15 benefit from the resolution of the tax examination. 
So in summary our diversification across geographies, product lines, customer segments and product life cycles produced 14% top line and 27% bottom line growth. This allowed us to generate over $7 billion of operating cash flow, the second highest level in the history of Microsoft. 
With that let me turn it back to Chris who will provide you with our fourth quarter guidance and our preliminary outlook for fiscal year 2009.
Chris Liddell
Thanks Colleen, I’m going to spend my remaining time on the call giving you a view of our expectations for the fourth quarter followed by a preliminary view of fiscal 2009. I also note that we have about twice the number of people on the call as normal so for some of the newcomers I’ll also make some brief comments on our proposed acquisition of Yahoo.
Let me begin by outlining some of our key assumptions for the fourth quarter. We’ll assume the following macroeconomic conditions for the remainder of the year; we expect the software spending environment to remain mixed but positive overall on a global basis especially for the positioning of our products and the value they offer. Like you we are cautious on the reported economic softness in the US but at this point we have not seen any significant spillover to our businesses. We continue to benefit from strong underlying growth in non-US and emerging markets which has also been assisted by stronger international currencies. 
For the fourth quarter we expect PC hardware unit growth of 9% to 11%. Growth will continue to be driven by strength in emerging markets while we are tempering our forecast to growth rates in mature markets. [inaudible] fourth quarter guidance and year-over-year growth rates, we expect revenue of $15.5 billion to $15.8 billion representing excellent growth of 16% to 18% over fiscal 2007. Revenue guidance by business unit is as follows: for client we expect revenue growth of 7% to 11% for the fourth quarter. The guidance of [power] units, OEM units will grow in line slightly ahead of the PC hardware market and underlying PC market dynamics in the consumer and emerging market segments will drive OEM unit growth in excess of OEM revenue. 
Sever and tools revenue should 18% to 20% in fourth quarter. We expect corporate demand for our server products to remain strong which will drive double-digit growth across the [bricks] of our server platform products and services. In the online services business we forecast revenue to be up 37% to 41% for the fourth quarter. Microsoft business division revenue should grow 15% to 16% on continued demand for the 2007 Office Suites, SharePoint and Office communication server. Lastly entertainment and devices division revenue is expected to grow 32% to 34% driven by strong demand for Xbox 360 consoles and games. 
Turning back to company wide performance operating income for the fourth quarter is expect to be between $5.8 billion and $6.2 billion representing 46% to 54% growth over the prior year which included the Xbox 360 warranty charges. Excluding those charges operating income should grow a very healthy 15% to 22%. Fully diluted earnings per share expected to come in at $0.45 to $0.48 for the fourth quarter and this guidance assumes an effective tax rate of 30%. 
So with that fourth quarter guidance we arrived at the following expectations for the full fiscal year 2008. Revenue of $60.1 billion to $60.3 billion representing year-over-year growth of 17% to 18%; operating income of $22.6 billion to $23 billion, excluding the European commission fine of $1.4 billion in the quarter, operating income would have been $24 billion to $24.4 billion; and for fully diluted earnings per share we expect $1.87 to $1.90 representing growth of 33% to 35% when normalized for legal charges and tax benefits.
So with the close of the FAST Search and Transfer acquisition since the last time we provided you with guidance in January we’ve updated our fiscal ’08 guidance to include and estimate of about $50 million of in process R&D and integration costs related to the acquisition. 
From a balance sheet perspective we are maintaining our previous forecast of total unearned revenue balance to finish fiscal 2008 up 14% to 16% over prior years. Contract but not billed should also finish 2008 up from current levels. 
With that let’s turn our current thinking about the next fiscal year. Remember this represents our preliminary view prior to completing our internal budgeting and planning process which occurs during the fiscal fourth quarter. This guidance does not include any impacts from our proposed acquisition of Yahoo. Our current forecast for fiscal 2009 revenue is $66.9 billion to $68.0 billion which represents growth of 11% to 13%. On an absolute basis that represents an increase of approximately $7 billion to $8 billion of incremental revenues. We expect operating income to be between $26.7 billion and $27.4 billion or growing 18% to 19%. Excluding the European commission fine in fiscal 2008 operating income is expected to grow roughly in line with revenue growth. Although [inaudible] about costs and operating expenses [inaudible] is still preliminary we expect operating income margins to remain generally flat year-on-year which includes the impact of about $0.50 billion of additional expenses related to recently announced acquisitions including FAST and Danger which were not in our forecast when we saw many of you in New York in February. 
We look forward to providing more detail on the fiscal ’09 investments on our fourth quarter earnings call and our fiscal analyst meeting on July 24th. So for the rest of the income statement we expect investment income to be lower in fiscal ’09 due to lower yields on the investment portfolio as a result of lower interest rate environment but we are also modeling a decline in our tax rate to 28% in fiscal 2009 driven by continued shift in our earnings mix towards lower tax rate jurisdictions. We expect fully diluted earnings per share of $2.13 to $2.19 representing growth of 14% to 15%.
As always I’ll remind you to think about the guidance that we provided. You must also consider the risks. These included competitors, legal, execution and general market risks such as foreign exchange for instance, fluctuations in PC and server hardware growth rates, IT spendings, changes in the piracy rates of our products and customer acceptance of our new and existing products. Additionally changes in the mix of our sellings between the new [inaudible] and license only can have an impact on revenue, operating income and earnings per share by delaying revenue recognition into future periods. 
I’d like to wrap up with a couple of final comments. First as you consider the performance we’re delivering in fiscal 2008, and the preliminary view of fiscal ’09, they are great examples of the growth model we’ve had for the company which I outlined previously. It begins by focusing on the growth opportunities where we can differentiate ourselves through software and in particular business IT spending but also increasing the online advertising and consumer entertainment.
Add to that a truly global approach to our sales, two-thirds of our revenue driven from users outside of the US and about 15% in high growth emerging markets. These opportunities set the stage for healthy broad based revenue growth across our businesses. That revenue growth allows us to reinvest into our existing business, pursue both organic and inorganic growth opportunities while continuing to grow operating profits. Operating profits combined with reductions in our share count and improvements in our tax rate drive earnings per share growth. 
If we achieve the guidance we have outlined today over the three year period through fiscal year ’09 during one of the most difficult economic environments we have faced we will grow earnings per share approximately 80%. 
Lastly before handing the call back to Colleen, I wanted to provide a brief update on our proposal to acquire Yahoo. With or without a Yahoo combination Microsoft is focused on the online advertising market which is expected to double by 2010 to $80 billion. Although Yahoo would accelerate our efforts we have an existing strategy that is already centered on three key pillars; drive innovation and search, increase value to advertisers and publishers through innovation and scale and grow user engagement across our MSN and Windows Live properties. We have an extremely talented engineering team, a great portfolio of advertiser and publisher tools and key assets in information content, communications and social networking. Lastly we are committed to compete in online advertising through organic investments, partnerships and acquisitions such as aQuantive and Rapt. 
With respect to Yahoo we have been as evidenced in the size of our offer premium that speed is of the essence for the deal to make sense and get folded into our online strategy. Unfortunately the transaction has been anything but speedy as is being characterized by what would appear to be unrealistic expectations of value. Our initial offer was an extremely generous more than 100% premium fee [inaudible] core business. And our view on value is shaped by the long-term value of the company and we intend to remain disciplined in our approach. The strongest argument that I’ve heard on why we should increase our bid, simply that we can afford to, is not one that I favor. We’ve yet to see tangible evidence that our bid substantially undervalues the company. In fact we see the opposite. Yahoo continues to lose search share and profitability continues to decline year-on-year. The results that they announced on Tuesday were in line with the guidance that they gave on their last earnings call on January 29, after which their stock price closes at $19.05 and Wall Street analysts’ consensus on value was significantly decreased.
As outlined in our recent letter to the Yahoo Board, unless we make progress with Yahoo towards an agreement by this weekend, we will reconsider our alternatives. We will provide updates as appropriate next week. These alternatives clearly include taking the offer to Yahoo shareholders or to withdraw our proposal and focus on other opportunities both organic and inorganic. With that being said I’d like to remind you that we’re here today to discuss our earnings and we hope you understand that we can’t go beyond in the Q&A session what I’ve just said. 
With that I’ll hand the call back to Colleen so we can get started taking your questions.
Colleen Heally
Thank you Chris. Let’s now proceed to questions. We want to accommodate questions from as many people as possible so please avoid multi part questions and limit yourself to just one question. Operator, will you please repeat your instructions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Your first question comes from Charlie DiBona - Sanford Bernstein
Charlie DiBona - Sanford Bernstein
I know it’s early but I was wondering if we could maybe dive a little bit into your fiscal ’09 guidance, in particular you’re calling for something around 12% revenue growth here. With the US economy looking like its getting weaker, it doesn’t sound like you’ve included any kind of recession in your forecasting but can you maybe characterize your view of your business and how insolated it would be from a US based downturn and how solid that number looks if the economy starts to get weaker?
Chris Liddell
The first thing to comment on is in line with some of the prepared remarks that we made. One of the great things about our business from my perspective is the diversification and the diversification across geographies and across business types. So clearly we like everyone else would be impacted by an economic downturn if one was to get worse than where it is, but we have built in what we consider to be an appropriate level of conservatism at this stage for next year. And I’ll just remind you that two-thirds of our business is now out the US and some we’ve seen some very strong growth from emerging markets. So a very good geographic spread and also fairly a weak US dollar helps us in that perspective. 
The other thing to mention is this year would be one year that most people would say has been one of relatively difficult economic conditions so this is a year where if we finish out along the guidance that we have talked about we will have grown revenue by 17% to 18% and earnings per share by 33% to 35% so if we can turn in a performance like that in what a lot of people are finding to be a particularly difficult year, then that gives me a lot of confidence in our business model going forward.
Operator
Your next question comes from Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs
Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs
Chris the FY09 EPS guidance is quite robust so could you give us a sense for what does that assume in terms of the investment required for your goals in the online services business and if for whatever reason you don’t get Yahoo do you have to come back and revise down the margin for a build versus a buy decision?
Chris Liddell
There’s a reasonable amount of additional growth in our expense line for the online and is already imbedded into fiscal year ’09 so we’ll obviously give you more detail in three months because we haven’t completed our internal budgeting but if you look at the makeup of the expense growth then it’s around 20% to 25% of that growth will be to drive our online services division with those final numbers to be determined in the next three months. The balance will go into other high growth areas in the other divisions into things like building our sales force and in particular outside of the US and then we’re getting other impacts like FX and so forth coming in as well. But there is already a reasonably high proportion of expense growth allocated to the online services area and also in terms of CapEx we’re expecting to spend more next year and that’s imbedded in our numbers as well than this year. So clearly if Yahoo was to happen we’d have to overlay that impact. We would still think about spending I would think virtually all of that money in terms of organic growth anyway. If Yahoo wasn’t to happen, could we consider other investments, yes but we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. 
Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs
Great, the currency impact on the quarter, could you just give us a sense for that?
Chris Liddell
Yes, around 3% benefit both on the revenue and the expense side so if you like in the expense it’s a negative but a 3% impact broadly speaking in both revenue and expenses.
Operator
Your next question comes from Heather Bellini – UBS
Heather Bellini – UBS
I know piracy is a difficult thing to solve for each quarter but I know your comps here are getting tough in the second half of calendar year ’08, so how should we think about your progress – the progress you made in the second half of ’07 how much of a tough comp does that give you for the client business than in the second half of ’08 and then just about the buybacks, I believe I read in your Q you cut them to about a billion dollars this quarter, should we expect that level to stay until we know the outcome of the Yahoo transaction?
Chris Liddell
Starting with piracy, you’re right on a quarter-by-quarter basis and I’ll talk to you and other investors about this its difficult to look at piracy on a quarter-by-quarter because we can see individual enforcement actions make a big difference in any one quarter so we had a very good performance in the first two quarters of the year. The first and second quarter of our fiscal year a relatively weak performance, in fact it was a negative in this quarter so overall for the year, we still think that we will drive unit growth 1% to 2% higher than underlying market growth as a result of our combating piracy but relative to the first couple of quarters when we had very good performance that’s a little lower. So we still think it’s a positive trend overall but you are correct it does get progressively harder. In this particular quarter we had a couple of distributors had a particularly high distribution of unlicensed PCs in China due to some market conditions there. You can have that sort of one-off impact so it’s much better to look at it on a year by year rather than a quarter by quarter.
Heather Bellini – UBS
Just to understand that topic just because that means that in the September and December quarter of calendar year ’08 you’ve got pretty tough comps, is that the situation where we should expect your OEM to be below PC shipments for your revenue to grow less than PC shipment?
Chris Liddell
Are you talking about for the fourth quarter?
Heather Bellini – UBS
No I’m talking about for September and December given the tough comps you have September and December of ’08, you’ve got tough comps in piracy versus September and December of ’07. 
Chris Liddell
Yes I think for next year but I just don’t want to get into too much guidance. We still think that we will grow units more than PC demand but for the same, you’ll get the same impact that you’ve seen for this year which is the extent that it grows faster in emerging than mature markets et cetera then revenue will be slightly lower than unit growth and that will probably wash out to mean that revenue will be broadly in line or just slightly below overall market growth but we still think that our unit growth will be higher than market growth. 
Heather Bellini – UBS
Okay and then just the buyback question.
Chris Liddell
On the buyback, yes you are correct it was low this quarter in particular because of the Yahoo transaction. I want to maintain the most amount of flexibility for that transaction in terms of our cash buildup and how the final transaction might work if it does. Therefore I don’t intend to get into quarter by quarter and I don’t want to give specifics but also just from a legal perspective, its difficult for us to be too active in the buyback market so I would expect us to be relative modest from a buyback perspective until we get clarity on Yahoo one way or the other. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch
Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch
If you just look at the guidance philosophically Chris compared to the last couple of years the same time of the year when we you were giving guidance for the upcoming year I think guidance has been generally below consensus or bracketing consensus – mainly conservative giving you the opportunity to outperform as you execute on your model. I’m just curious this time around I think the guidance tests certainly as Charlie indicated assumes some US – actually a reasonable level of execution on the revenue side range of 12% growth but I’m wondering on the earnings side if you’re not giving enough flexibility for potential spending in the online business if the Yahoo transaction were not to come through just philosophically I guess my question is how do you think about guidance relative to the trend – it seems like there’s a bit of a change here and I’m just curious what your thought process there is.
Chris Liddell
There’s a few trends here, from a revenue point of view, as I mentioned to Charlie I feel very good about our revenue forecast 11% to 13% for next year. I think that’s very good in the current economic environment and as I said I think that is a testament to the strength of our particular investment business model and also the fact that we have made a lot of investments in the past. We have talked to investors about the benefits of those investments and I think that is starting to pay. Clearly in this year where we’ve driven revenue by over 16% and next year 11% to 13% feels very good. So I feel good on the revenue side. On the operating expense side I think we’re making at this stage plenty of provisions for what I consider to be appropriate OpEx not just in the online services but across the whole business. So I don’t feel bad that we are leaving anything out there. Clearly if we were to make another acquisition or to acquire Yahoo that does change the game but in terms of allowing us to do what we want to do organically and through some level of acquisition not only in online services but in other businesses I feel good about the level that we have built in at this stage. And overall earnings per share growing 14% to 15% I guess some assumptions there about buybacks and investment income, I mentioned the tax rate is starting to come down and I talked about this at the last couple of financial analyst meeting that we are now in a period where you can expect to see our tax rate start to go down year after year not only in fiscal year ’09 but in fiscal year ’10 as well as a result of the changes in our business models. So if you look at the individual parts of guidance for fiscal year ’09 at this stage I feel we are hanging together very well. 
Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch
and also the bookings growth rate, coming in at 14% do you think that is more indicative of what we should expect over the few quarters because I think and right after the product launches you had 30% and then it looks like we’ve seen some deceleration but is this the real run rate going forward given that we’re entering a more mature aspect of the product cycle?
Chris Liddell
You would expect over the long-term that bookings growth and overall revenue growth to be broadly both the same as each other so if we can continue to get bookings growth excluding Vista unearned impact but general bookings growth in the mid teens that would support low to mid teens revenue growth. If that’s the mature part of the cycle then that’s pretty healthy from my perspective.
Operator
Your next question comes from John Difucci - Bear Stearns
John Difucci – Bear Stearns
I have a follow-up to Heather’s question and it has to do with the anti piracy efforts. The September to December quarters we saw some big benefits from that and actually seemed to take us by surprise and you by surprise and this quarter that looks to have reversed. Chris you mentioned I guess government crackdowns and we had heard some of those in the second half of last year, is there any other color you can give us on that because trying to understand this and obviously its going to be a fight as you move along but if its always going to be you get a foot and you give up a yard kind of thing, I’m just trying to figure out what you see and in Asia this quarter why would it sort of reverse and then secondly on that I’m just curious why you expect an acceleration in PC growth into the next quarter especially given the macroeconomic backdrop. 
Chris Liddell
On piracy or more particularly on license shipments which become pirated, you are true that on a quarter by quarter basis it can move around quite a lot and hopefully you recall in particular in the first quarter that I said don’t take too much from this positive number. You can get an aberration like this on a quarterly basis and you could have a negative one by implication and that’s what we have seen this quarter. So again I’ll just reinforce you really need to look at things like piracy on a long-term basis and average them out to really get a sense of how it’s happening. In the first quarter in particular we saw a very strong performance in our Russian subsidiary which helped enormously when you spread that volume over the total business. In this quarter in China because of some specific market dynamics that happened in that country you saw a relatively negative performance. You have got to wash those things out. You have got to look at it on the course of the year. We still think for the year we are going to have PC unit growth of 11% to 13%. We think we are going to ship our units of 12% to 14%. So we still think we are going to pick up one maybe two percent of shipment growth relative to overall market growth and that washes out the unders and overs and that’s how I prefer to think of it. 
Colleen Heally
And just to put that into a little more context too on the unlicensed PCs aspect, just keep in mind that when we were looking at the PC units to OEM units that was one of three factors that we talked you through in bridging that, so that is one of three factors. 
Chris Liddell
In terms of overall PC demand what I would say is we started the year believing that we were going to have about 9% to 11% in terms of unit shipments. The third quarter came in at 8% to 10%. So broadly speaking it was in line with where we started the year. It was a little bit weaker in mature markets which I think picks up some of the economic issues that we are seeing particularly in the US but it was stronger in emerging markets. So the mix was different to what we thought but the overall market was about in line, 1% lower which is [around the area] really to where we started the year. What we saw really was a particularly strong performance in Q1 and Q2 so it’s difficult to continue to extrapolate an out performance, 8 to 10 I don’t feel bad about. And if we can end the year at 11 to 13 which is how we feel relative to a starting point of 9 to 11 we still feel that’s a good robust year but obviously on a quarter by quarter basis again you can read too much into an individual quarter if you look at the year it looks pretty good.  
John Difucci – Bear Stearns
Yes but how could you I mean given the macro backdrop it just seems kind of odd that you would assume that PC sales would increase in this current quarter versus the 8 to 10.
Chris Liddell
Well we’re talking about 9 to 11 for the fourth quarter relative to 8 to 10 for the third quarter. So it’s a 1% change. And don’t forget the third quarter, this quarter [lept] Vista launch last year so you’ve got some aberrations on a year on year basis but accelerating from 8 to 10 to a 9 to 11 third quarter to fourth quarter doesn’t feel like its – we haven’t got the foot on the accelerator very hard to achieve that.

Your next question comes from Robert Breza - UBS Capital Markets
Robert Breza - UBS Capital Markets
I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the integration of aQuantive and I guess where does that sit relative to your estimates and how is that tracking to your plan?
Chris Liddell
There's a number of ways of looking at how it’s integrated. The first and most important is from an employee integration point of view given that the real revenue potential is some years out. From the employee point of view we couldn’t have been happier. All of the key executives have remained. Brian [Makendries] is doing a great job leading that and is taking a broader role inside Microsoft in terms of driving that part of the strategy. We’ve integrated in my view the cultures very well and we’ve got people from aQuantive taking a broader role and Microsoft people from the previous Microsoft working inside and helping drive aQuantive strategy and they’re very active and thinking the way in which they can not only build aQuantive as it was but use the financial and other resources of Microsoft to make aQuantive go faster. So if you take that as the sort of first determinate of how well things have gone, I’m extremely happy with that. In terms of the underlying business, leading indicator would be just number of publishers we’re getting on board again that’s going very healthy. We’ve talked through the quarter I think we’ve made a few announcements. There are 96 I believe new publishers of various sizes have switched on to the Atlas Publisher Suite in the last quarter, since we announced sorry. So very good growth in the underlying dynamic in the business. From a profitability point of view, we’re carrying the costs of the acquisition but we are managing to achieve the results that we talked about despite the fact that at this stage its early days for aQuantive and we’re carrying in particular some of the non-cash charges associated with the acquisition. So the revenue growth is still ahead of us, from a cost point of view we’re in line but it’s a negative. From a publisher business point of view good early indicators and from a people point of view it’s excellent.

Your next question comes from Kirk Materne - Banc of America Securities
Kirk Materne - Banc of America Securities
Operating margins for the fourth quarter appear to be going down just a tad versus the third fiscal quarter, could you just explain some of the dynamics around that. I realize you have just made some acquisitions. Is it mainly headcount related? Is there some mix shift going on between the businesses? Anything to do with E&D, obviously its going to have a strong quarter with Grand Theft Auto, I’m just trying to get the dynamics about that.
Chris Liddell
The problem looking at margins for the business overall is you inevitably get quite a lot of difference between the individual businesses and how they make up one quarter. So that’s the first statement and its best to look at the year overall where you’re looking at margin expansion but if you look at the trends through the quarters. I think quarter one was 43%, quarter two was 39.6, quarter three was 40.3, and quarter four was 37.6, overall 40. So in any one quarter you can get quite different movements and that reflects (a) the mix of businesses and (b) if you have a strong Xbox quarter you get a lot of the [cogs] associated with that that tends to decrease the margins. Fourth quarter we get a lot of marketing and signup costs associated with our enterprise businesses which generally are buying annuities. So we don’t get a lot of the revenue associated with it, we get some of the costs and we get the benefits of that revenue flying through for the next year. So the short answer to your question is there is nothing unusual in the fourth quarter. We typically see it if you look back in previous years it’s a low margin quarter relative to the first, second and third. There’s nothing unusual about this fourth quarter. Its part of the normal cycle.
Kirk Materne - Banc of America Securities
If I could just follow-up on John’s question just on the acceleration in PCs into the fourth quarter, one of the comments you had about the last quarter was just the inventory levels being a little bit higher heading into the third quarter, I assume those have been drawn down to levels you feel more comfortable with heading into the fourth quarter?
Chris Liddell
Yes, although just to be clear I think John’s question was PC units overall and inventory levels tend to be a comment about our shipments to OEM so those are very tightly related to each other clearly but in answer to your question, yes they are [inaudible] more normal. Although I will say it’s quite early in the quarter. Sometimes we get that information over the next few weeks but there’s nothing that we’re seeing that’s unusual going into this quarter and that’s embedded in our guidance.
Operator
Your final question comes from the line of Brent Thill - Citigroup
Brent Thill – Citigroup
Chris just drilling into the client line item, that was clearly probably the biggest disappointment relative to all of our models and understanding the licensing change but when you drill into what’s happening with Vista and XP are you still happy with what you’re seeing in the Vista upgrade cycle or are you still seeming more units of XP going than you like and that wouldn’t obviously have an impact on the pricing?
Chris Liddell
Yes, with respect to the quarter, the third quarter in particular there’s really no Vista-related issues at all. In terms of the impacts, firstly the overall PC market, unlicensed PCs which is not a Vista issue. Emerging markets growing faster than mature markets, that’s not really a Vista issue. A bit of a channel shift to larger OEMs again not a Vista issue. And obviously if we sell a unit of XP rather than selling a unit of Vista we’re still relatively happy because of the realization and so there’s nothing in the third quarter that is specific to Vista in terms of the walkthrough from the overall PC market down to overall client revenue. I guess the only Vista impact really is the launch last year and the very strong comparables that we have but that’s not really a comment about this quarter its more a comment on the year-ago quarter and the comparable.
Colleen Heally
Yes I think if you look at whether it’s Vista, [inaudible] or from a mix standpoint we can let you know we’re up a bit sequentially in terms of Vista -- shared with you 140 million licenses sold so you know I think things are tracking well and as expected from our perspective. 
Chris Liddell
So with that I’ll thank you all, I’ll hand it back to Colleen to finish but I look forward to talking to a number of you in three months and in particular seeing a number of you at the financial analyst meeting a few days later.

Chris Liddell

Thanks Colleen and good afternoon everyone.  I’ll begin today’s call by providing you with the highlights from our second quarter results and discuss our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2008.  Results for the quarter were outstanding.  Revenues surpassed our previous record high by $2 billion and at $16.4 billion that exceeded the high end of our expectations by over $300 million.
We are benefitting from the investments we’ve made over recent years plus excellent execution performance from our field sales force.  Revenue in the quarter grew 30% or 15% adjusted for the technology guarantees in the comparable period last year.  Besides just the sheer size and pace of growth, the breadth was notable as we saw strength across all customer segments, divisions, channels and geographies.  
For example, demand from enterprise customers combined with healthy holiday consumer spending for Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office system drove revenue for the business group a combined 18% for the quarter.  Server and tools, once again delivered double digit revenue growth in the quarter, the 22nd in a row.  Healthy enterprise agreements signings across the company drove our unearned revenue balance up over $0.5 billion, $500 million above our guidance.  
The successful integration of our eQuantive acquisition plus good organic growth helped our online business grow 38% and a compelling lineup of Xbox games drove our performance for our entertainment and devices division.  E&D had its second consecutive quarter in the black, on its way to our target of full year profitability.
From a geographic perspective, over 60% of our sales are from users in regions outside of the US.  Revenue in those regions continue to drive growth for the company with non-US mature markets up over 20% for the first half of the year and emerging markets up nearly 30%.  
During the quarter we combined revenue growth with cost efficiencies resulting in operating income growth of 27%, even adjusted for the tech guarantees of last year.  Operating margins during the quarter were a healthy 40%.  Lastly, earnings per share growth of 32% after adjusting for last year’s tech guarantee continued to benefit from the accommodation of strong operating performance and execution of our share repurchase program.
So overall the quarter and half one performance demonstrates that we’re realizing the benefits from our expanding business lines, product SKUs and global presence.  The investments we’ve made, including in our sales force and new product offerings have positioned us well to offer the right product in the right markets worldwide.  And during the quarter we refreshed and bolstered our product line up with releases of Microsoft Dynamic CRM, Visual Studio 2008, new Zune devices and progress towards the upcoming server offerings, including release candidate one of Windows Server 2008 and a beta of our server virtualization technology, Hyper-V.
In light of the strong second quarter, we are increasing our revenue, operating income and earnings per share guidance for the year.  We now expect revenue growth of 17-18% and operating income growth of 31-32% and finally we’re raising our earnings per share forecast by $0.07 for the year to $1.85-$1.88, a growth of 30-32%.  With those high level themes, I’m going to turn the call over to Colleen for more details on our second quarter performance.
Colleen Healy

Thanks Chris.  The strong momentum that kicked off our fiscal year continued in our second quarter.  As Chris mentioned, revenue exceeded the high end of our expectations by $300 million during the quarter.  This was driven by demand for our flagship product of Windows Vista and Office 2007 as well as a good holiday season for our Xbox franchise.  This revenue outperformance combined with decreasing Xbox 360 console costs flowed through to operating income and earnings per share.  
Let me provide you with details of our financial performance starting with revenue.  I’ll discuss top line financial and business momentum points and then follow up with revenue performance for each of the business units.  Then I’ll review the rest of the income statement.  All growth comparisons relate to the comparable quarter of last year unless otherwise specified.
Revenue is $16.4 billion, an increase of 30%.  Adjusting the year ago quarter by the $1.6 billion of revenue deferrals primarily related to the technology guarantee program for Windows and Office, total revenue grew 15%.  With business and consumer PCs each experiencing double digit growth rates, the underlying PC hardware market increased an estimated 14-16% during the quarter, about 3 points higher than our expectations.  PC growth rates in emerging markets continue to outpace that of mature markets.  Europe led the mature markets and we again saw significant improvement in the US and especially in Japan.
Our mix of product billings for the quarter was approximately 30% from OEMs, 30% from multi-year agreements, 20% from license only sales and the balance from our other businesses.  Annuities sales were robust, particularly for server and tools in anticipation of the major product releases scheduled for the second half.  This combined with enterprise agreement renewal rates, consistent with historical trends, drove our unearned revenue balance over $0.5 billion above our guidance to $12.2 billion, up 20% year over year normalizing for the impact of the tech guarantee deferrals.
Our contracted not billed balance increased sequentially to over $11.5 billion, up well over $1 billion from where we started the fiscal year.  When taken together with reported revenue, total bookings for the company were almost 20%.
Now I will provide revenue highlights by business segment, starting with clients.  A robust personal computer market and progress against software piracy drove client revenues to $4.3 billion, up 68%, or 16% after adjusting for tech guarantees.  Over 80% of client revenue comes from our OEM business.  During the quarter, we grew our OEM unit shipments at 18%, approximately 3 percentage points faster than the overall hardware market.  Curbing software piracy has been a significant investment area for the company over the last several years and those investments are paying off.
OEM revenue grew 80% or 18% when normalized for the tech guarantee and in line with our OEM unit growth rate.  In terms of premium mix, three out of every four Windows customers adopted premium versions during the quarter.  Consumer premium units grew over 50% while business premium units grew 12%.  As a result, the OEM premium mix increased by 8 points to 75%, driven by an 11 point increase in the consumer element of the mix and offset by a 3 point decline in the business  portion due to the pricing differences between business premium and consumer premium SKUs, these changes in the premium have largely offsetting impacts to revenue.
The commercial and retail licensing portion of the business increased 18%, up 8% adjusted for tech guarantees as business customers continue to add client products to their annuity agreements.  Next week will mark the one year anniversary of the general availability of Windows Vista.  We feel extremely good about the performance it has driven this first year.  Specifically, client revenue is growing on average over 40%, up over 20% adjusted for tech guarantees.  Client volume licensing portion of the unearned revenue balance has increased 29% year over year.  And sales of Windows Vista have surpassed 100 million licenses.
Server and tools revenue increased 15% to $3.3 billion, driven by double digit revenue growth in each of the Windows Server and SQL Server businesses.  Coupled with the significant shift in our billings to annuity licensing in advance of the upcoming product releases, this resulted in the server and tools portion of the unearned revenue balance increasing by over $1 billion, up by over 35% year over year.
License growth for Windows Server and SQL Server grew at healthy double digit rates in the quarter.  Our premium SKU Windows Server Enterprise Edition with its virtualization capabilities grew 35%.  Our consulting revenue increased 28% as we’ve experienced higher demand following the recent business product launches across the company.  
Online services business revenue grew 38% to $863 million, including $154 million from the addition of aQuantis.  Online advertising growth for the quarter was also 38%, up 26% excluding aQuantis.  Our online audience continues to grow.  Windows Live usage broadened as Live IDs increased over 20% to $427 million and the Windows Live Suite was downloaded 45 million times since its launch in November.  
We also continue to expand our advertising and content partnerships.  During the quarter, we became the exclusive third-party advertising partner on a worldwide basis for Facebook and we announced strategic alliances with Viacom and CNBC.  Since we announced our acquisition of aQuantis, 60 new publishers have switched to the atlas publishers suite offering.  
Microsoft business division revenue was $4.8 billion, up 37% or 20% normalized for tech guarantees.  Returns on our investment in field sales specialists were evident as they contributed to double digit revenue growth across a broad range of productivity offerings.  Revenue from business customers was up 23% in the quarter on continued broad based demand for not only versions of Office 2007 but also for Sharepoint Exchange, Office Communications Server and the Dynamic product.
Sharepoint and Office Communications Server had a great quarter with each experiencing growth in excess of 50% and Dynamic’s customer billings were up 26%.  Consumer revenue grew 10% adjusted for tech guarantees.
Entertainment and Devices revenue grew 3% to $3.1 billion, over $90 million above our high end guidance, driven by an abundance of high demand game titles which contributed to setting a record lifetime to date software attach rate of 7.0.  In addition to normalized for the impact, in order to normalize for the impact of retailers advancing some of their holiday console purchases into Q1, spurred by the September launch of Halo 3, performance of the two quarters should be assessed together.  With that in mind, entertainment and devices revenue grew 25% in the first half of the fiscal year.
Exiting the calendar year, life to date sales of Xbox 360 consoles hit 17.7 million units.  Based on US and PD data released last week, Xbox 360 sold over 1 million more consoles than PS3 in the holiday quarter.  From a shared wallet perspective, consumers spent 27% more on Xbox 360 consoles, games and accessories than on the Wii and twice as much than on the PS3.  Xbox 360 had four titles that sold over 1 million copies in the quarter, compared to three for the Wii and none for PS3.  Xbox Live rapidly achieved its 10 million members goal six months ahead of schedule.
On the music scene, we are pleased by the favorable editorial reviews received by the second generation of Zune.  1.5 million people joined the Zune social online community during the holiday season and music downloads from our marketplace approximately doubled from last year.
Now for the rest of the income statement.  Cost of revenue decreased by $75 million, primarily driven by more Xbox 360 component costs that were partially offset by growth in our consulting business, expansion of data center operations and the addition of aQuanits cost.  After adjusting prior year second quarter for the impact of tech guarantees, cost of revenue decreased by 4 points to 22% of sales.
Operating expenses increased 16%, expense growth was slightly higher than head count growth due to legal charges taken in the quarter.  Operating income grew at a faster rate than revenue to $6.5 billion, adjusting for the prior year for the tech guarantee, cost of revenue improvement drove margin expansion, increasing our operating margin by 4 points to 40%.
Investment income and other totaled $339 million for the quarter.  Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 31%, half a point higher than what we previously guided.  Cash flow from operations increased 124% to $4.6 billion.  During the quarter we repurchased 120 million shares or $4.1 billion of company stock and paid out over $1 billion in dividends to shareholders.  Diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 9.5 billion, down 4% from the prior year as a result of share repurchases, but flat sequentially primarily due to stock options exercise in the quarter.
Earnings per share for the quarter was $0.50 which was $0.04 above our high end guidance, driven by the revenue outperformance.  So in summary we are extremely pleased with this quarter’s revenue performance.  When combined with decreasing cost of revenue, operating income and EPS growth were also impressive.  With that, let me turn it back to Chris who will provide you with our third quarter guidance and outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2008.
Chris Liddell

Thanks Colleen.  So let turn to the details of our forecast for the third quarter and the full year, beginning with some of the key underlying assumptions.  For our fiscal 2008 forecast we’ll assume the following macroeconomic conditions for the remainder of the year.  As I mentioned before, over 60% of our business originates from countries outside of the US and we expect the overall software spending environment to remain healthy on a global basis.  
In US markets, although clearly the risk of an economic slowdown exists, we have not seen any significant spillover to our businesses and lastly we continue to benefit from strong underlying growth in non-US and emerging markets which has also been assisted by stronger international currencies.
No company is immune from macroeconomic factors but overall we believe our business is extremely well positioned in the technology industry with diversification across a broad set of products, channels, geographies, currencies and customer segments, supported by excellent product value and sales execution.
For PC hardware units, we expect growth of 11-13% for the fiscal year, an increase of one percentage point from our prior outlook, reflecting the upside we saw in the quarter.  Third quarter growth is forecasted to be 9-11%, slightly lower than the year because of the difficult prior year comparables from the launch of Windows Vista.  We expect PC hardware shipment units to decline sequentially from the first half to the second half of the fiscal year, in line with historic seasonality.
Growth will continue to be driven by strength in emerging markets and we expect growth rates in the consumer segment to outpace that in the business segment.  In terms of our detailed guidance, we expect fiscal year revenue to be in the range of $59.9-$60.5 billion, growing 17-18%, which is an increase of over $700 million from our prior forecast, based on the strong exit from Q2.  We expect revenue in the third quarter of $14.3-$14.6 billion, up 12-15%, excluding the impact of the technology guarantee deferrals in the prior year.
And with that I’ll provide details of this guidance by segment.  Starting with client, we expect full year growth to be 13-14% with OEM revenue growing roughly in line with the PC market.  The third quarter, growth should be 3-5%, excluding the impact for tech guarantees.  When thinking about the third quarter revenue growth for client, keep in mind that the strong customer sections for launch of Windows Vista in the year ago period makes it a difficult comparable.
Server tools revenue should grow 17-18% for the full year and 17-19% for the third quarter.  We expect continued corporate demand for our server products which will drive double digit growth across the breadth of our server platform, products and services.  We’re forecasting the billings mix of server and tools to continue to shift towards annuity agreements ahead of the upcoming releases.
Next month marks and important milestone to the group with the commencement of the joint launch activities for Windows Server 2008, SQL Server 2008 and Visual Studio 2008.  Together these products will allow IT departments to be more productive by providing them with a secure, trusted and manageable platforms and which will underpin growth in the server and tools business over the next several years.
With the online services business, we forecast revenue to grow between 37-40% for the year and to be up 40-45% in the third quarter.  Online advertising is expected to grow approximately 35% for both the quarter and the full year.
Microsoft business division continues to be truly outstanding financial performance.  We’ve raised our full year revenue guidance to 16-17% for the year and 11-12% for the third quarter, we’re normalizing for last year’s tech guarantee.  Growth in the second half of the year will be largely driven by the same factors that made the first half a success.  We expect to see continued demand for the 2007 Office Suite and Sharepoint and Office Communication Server should continue to grow double digits.  When thinking about growth in the second half of the year for the business division, bear in mind the growth of retail demand for the Office 2007 last year created the tough comparable.
Our [unintelligible] does not include the any impact on the recently announced acquisition of FAST which we anticipate to close during our fourth quarter of the fiscal year and is not expected to have a material impact on earnings per share during this fiscal year. 
For the entertainment and devices division, expect revenue growth of 21-24% for the full year and 25-30% for the third quarter.  We’ve raised the full year second half revenue forecast to reflect the record software attach rates and strength in Xbox console sales we experienced in the first half of the year.  
Turning back to companywide performance, operating income for the year is expected to be between $24.2-$24.4 billion, up 31-32% for the year, an increase of 3-4 points from our outlook in October.  Our higher revenue forecast is responsible for the increase in operating income as we expect greater than 75% of the incremental revenue to flow through to operating profit.  For the third quarter, we expect operating income to be between $5.6-$5.7 billion.
As a result of the higher operating income guidance, we’re increasing our full year earnings per share results to be $1.85-$1.88, an increase of $0.07 from our previous guidance.  For the third quarter we expect earnings per share of $0.43-$0.45.  This guidance assumes an effective tax rate of 30.5% for the full year.
From balance sheet perspective, total unearned revenue should finish fiscal 2008, up 14-16%, 6 points or about $750 million above our October guidance, driven by strong annuity billings in our core businesses of client MBD and server and tools as well as an increase in an annuity licensing mix.  Excluding deferred revenue for undelivered elements, the remaining portion of the unearned revenue should increase 20-23%.
When thinking about sequential changes in unearned revenue from Q2 to Q3, we expect the balance to follow historical patterns and remain roughly flat.  Contracted not billed should also finish 2008 up from current levels.
As always, I’ll remind you to think about guidance we’re providing, you must also consider risks.  These risks include competitors, legal, execution and general market risks, such as foreign exchange rate movements, fluctuations in PC and server hardware growth rates, IT spending and customer acceptance of our new and existing products.
Additionally, changes in the mix of our billings between annuity and license only can have an impact on revenues, operating income and earnings per share by delaying revenue recognition into future periods.
Before moving on to questions, let me mention a few things.  Firstly I’d like to welcome Stephen Elop to Microsoft.  Stephen has a wealth of experience from both an operational and leadership perspective and he will add a new dimension to our leadership team.  However I will also personally will miss working with Jeff Raikes who will retire from the company in September.  He’s done a fantastic job over the years and leaves us not only with a strong Office franchise, but he has redefined the role of business productivity software at Microsoft by expanding the business into new areas of productivity offerings to collaboration, unified communications, business intelligence, DRP and CRM, resulting in a near doubling of MBD annual revenues since the year 2000.  It’s notable that MBD is now the largest division of Microsoft in size of revenue.
Lastly I will look forward to seeing a number of you a week from Monday in New York where Steve Ballmer and I will provide you an update on the strategic direction of the company.  For those of you who are unable to join us for this, we’ll make available a live webcast as well as on demand replay of the presentation.  So with those comments I’ll hand the call back Colleen so we can get started taking your questions.
Colleen Healy

Great, thanks Chris.  Let’s now proceed to questions.  We want to accommodate questions from as many people as possible so please avoid multiple part questions and limit yourself to just one question.  Operator, will you repeat your instructions please?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator

Thank you.  We will now begin the question and answer session.  If you would like to ask a question, please press star one.  If you need to withdraw your request, press star two.  Our first question comes from Heather Bellini with UBS.
Heather Bellini – UBS

Hi, thank you.  Excuse my voice, good afternoon everybody.  Chris, I was wondering, you’ve shown a lot of impressive top line performance over the last few quarters and in particular some nice upside in operating income.  I guess my question is after the past few years when we’ve seen operating margins contract, do you feel now you’re in a position where you’ve made some of the big catch up investments you discussed in April of ’06 and now looking forward the spending will be more incremental in nature and then I just have a follow up for that when you’re done.
Chris Liddell

Sure, as I’ve said in previous calls and certainly at financial analyst meeting, I think you have to look at the company in three parts.  The core businesses, the entertainment and devices business and the online business because the dynamics from a margin perspective are quite different in each of those and obviously the company is an amalgam of the three.
In the core businesses, if you put them together collectively, certainly the operating margin has remained an impressively constant, in fact slightly up over the last few years and so we see revenue growth sort of broadly in line with operating income growth, operating [unintelligible] in those. 
The entertainment and devices division has moved from a loss to a profit so clearly the margins have improved there.  On the online business, it has been and will continue certainly for the foreseeable future to be in investment mode so that has a different dynamic altogether.  When you put those three together then the operating margin for the company will be very good this year and you can see that in our guidance for the year.  So overall we’re not making any predictions including on the call at the moment about past the next couple of quarters but the operating margin performance as an average of those three trends is good for this year.
Heather Bellini – UBS

Okay, that was my follow up is really you’ve been in operating margin contraction mode for the past few years, you finally seem to be kicking it into high gear there where you’re going to have well over 100 basis points, so should we expect Steve, when he’s in town in two weeks to kind of discuss an operating plan for the company going forward where we might hear more about the increased leverage in the business?
Chris Liddell

I want to qualify the purpose of the February call, we’ve always seen that as a good chance to talk about the strategic direction of the company.  So you can certainly expect to hear the investment themes, but as you know we’re a quarter ahead of most companies in terms of giving out fiscal year guidance by doing it in April, and what I don’t want to do is raise expectations that suddenly we’re going to start doing that in February and then maybe we’ll start doing it in November and we’ll do it a year ahead of time.  It is a time to talk about the strategy of the company and the strategic themes and at a very high level that will give some indication of our thoughts about where we will invest, but it’s not going to be a financial guidance exercise.
Heather Bellini – UBS

Okay great, thank you.
Colleen Healy

Thanks Heather, we hope you’re feeling better than your voice sounds.  Next question please.

The next question comes from Sarah Friar with Goldman Sachs.
Sarah Friar – Goldman Sachs

Good afternoon guys, good quarter.  So following on that ending comment there Chris about areas where you’ll invest, if you look at the online services business, it’s still relatively small, the growth kind of ex-aQuantive is still not quite at the levels you might see from competitors.  How are you thinking about strategically where you need to go with that business and what are some of the big milestones we should be looking for over the next couple of quarters, maybe over the next year?
Chris Liddell

Well we certainly see it as a multi-year journey that we’re going on and so we’re investing with an expectation of hoping to be at a critical mass in several years.  I’m happy if you look at the quarter [unintelligible] if you like the incremental progress we’ve made, revenue growth of 38%, ex-aQuantive in the mid 20’s, it certainly very respectable.  You are right in the sense it’s not at the size of critical mass we’d like to see and we are building a business we believe and hope will be at critical mass in the next few years.  
But I come back to the theme that we have talked about on several quarters and certainly at financial analyst meetings, we make decisions on investments now which have multi-year implications and when you look at the revenue performance over the last couple of quarters, that didn’t happen by accident.  That happened as a result of investments that we made several years ago so you have to look back two or three years to look at the leading indicators of how we’ve been able to drive revenue growth at extremely good levels and higher than most people’s expectations than the last couple of quarters.  
So when you look forward in the online business, you have to think about the revenue, several years out and the infrastructure we are building for that.  Unfortunately from a financial perspective, that means investment now, but that’s the way that we think about the company and that’s the way we’ll continue to run it.
Sarah Friar – Goldman Sachs

And just a follow up on that.  So that has been an area where you’ve definitely been willing to look for inorganic growth, successfully with aQuantive and so on.  Is that also part of the ongoing strategy there, could we expect to see some more acquisitions go on for OSB that are of size?
Chris Liddell

We obviously don’t speculate on acquisitions in any particular area.  We’ve been willing to drive inorganic growth really across all of the divisions.  It probably gets a little more attention than the online business because of its nature, but in fact when you look at the acquisitions we’ve made, they’re across a broad spread, server and tools, the FAST acquisition that we made in the enterprise search area, some of the ones we’ve made in the entertainment and devices division.  So, we have been willing to use our balance sheet to drive inorganic growth right across the company.  
I don’t expect that to not continue, I think that trend will continue and again we’ve signaled, I think Steve and I, our willingness to do acquisitions over the last couple of years.  I don’t think you’ll necessarily see some dramatic increase in the number that we do, they’ve been going along at about a couple of months for the last couple of years and where we see opportunities where the situation is right, we’ll look to use acquisitions.
Sarah Friar – Goldman Sachs

Great, thanks very much.

Our next question comes from Charlie Di Bona with Sanford Bernstein.
Charlie Di Bona – Sanford Bernstein

Hi, Chris, for the last two quarters you’ve called out anti-piracy as a driver in the client business.  Could you maybe give a little more color on the sort of specific impact that that’s had an how you see that playing out as a driver for client going forward.  And then maybe also touch on some of the other divisions, I’m thinking particularly the MBD division with Office where anti-piracy has some potential to effect results as well.
Chris Liddell

Sure, it is an interesting trend Charlie and it’s a good one to call out.  Historically we’ve seen the difference between the unit shipments that we have relative to the overall PC market.  A benefit in our anti-piracy of 1-2%, so our sales if you like grow 1-2% faster than the market as a result of taking piracy away.  Over the last couple of quarters that’s picked up, it was around 5% in the first quarter and around 3% in the second quarter.
So that’s giving us the confidence to raise in terms of our expectations that to the 1-2%, more like 2-3% going forward.  If you say, why is that happening, there’s a few factors.  Firstly, better enforcement, so we’ve had a significant enforcement activity over the last few quarters, something like 74 legal actions in 22 countries, so working with local governments who are becoming much more sensitive to this as an issue and very strong government partnerships from us.  We’ve seen some of the technology advances in Vista helping us, relative to previous additions of Windows.  Also we’ve seen a shift to laptops and in particular sales through multi-national OEMs who typically have a lower piracy rate.
Now, not all of those factors are beneficial from a revenue point of view, you know the average selling price through large multi-national OEMs is typically lower than in the smaller entities, but overall from a unit perspective it’s helping us about 3% and it’s offsetting some of the mix shift that we see and some of the other factors and so it’s just been a very good trend and it certainly in the last two to three quarters has picked up from what we’ve seen in previous two to three years.
Colleen Healy

And then I would say as a broader theme, the company is focused on piracy really across all of our software offerings, including Office and MBD as you also asked about.  With Office it’s tougher to quantify than we can with client because with Office we sell through so many different channels, volume licensing retail as well as OEMs.  We estimate about half of the worldwide base out there is pirated, so there is opportunities to make gains there as well.  And we’re doing a lot of those same sort of partnering with governments and educating people on the value of buying genuine software and keeping an eye really on retail sales of Office to see how that’s progressing.  And you know it’s been really robust since the launch of Office 2007, but unlike client we can’t give you a specific of a number in terms of how we’re doing on piracy.
Charlie Di Bona – Sanford Bernstein

Okay, thank you.
Operator

Adam Holt with J.P. Morgan, your line is open.
Adam Holt – J.P. Morgan

Good afternoon.  I wanted to drill down on the strength in MBD and Office which has been a consistent theme over the last several quarters.  Another quarter of better than 20% revenue growth in business office and related.  I wanted to see if that is primarily unit driven at this point or whether you’re actually starting to see an ASP uplift on the Office side and how long do you think you can sustain better than 20% growth for business revenue?
Chris Liddell

Yeah, firstly, specifically, it is very much around units, it’s not ASP driven.  And I’d pick out a couple of themes in particular.  One is just customer acceptance of the Office product itself which has been extremely good, you know it’s right at the top end of our expectations.  So when you talk to people, their like of the product is extremely high and we’re seeing that manifest itself from a financial perspective and very strong license sales right across the board.  So from consumer to small business to large businesses, the underlying office business and the office product has been a real success since launch.
That’s number one, number two is some of the other products are starting to become significant in their own right, so when you look at Sharepoint, growing over 20-30% year on year, that’s over $1 billion business now, so it’s a significant business in its own right and it’s incredibly successful again in terms of customer acceptance in rollout through the enterprise.  
Unified Communications a similar story.  Some of the Dynamics products, CRM and ERP which don’t get a lot of attention because we focus on the big parts but also growing at 30-40% growth.  So you’re seeing a very strong portfolio of products anchored around the Office product but with some extremely good secondary ones as well making a big contribution.  How long can that last?  Well we will start to lap the launch of Office 2007, so that impact won’t be necessary be a significant going forward, but if you look at the second half guidance we certainly see a lot of the same factors for the first half continuing to the second half.
Adam Holt – J.P. Morgan

If I could actually just ask a follow up on that.  You mentioned in your prepared comments that you’re taking a little bit more of a conservative view on spending in the US for the second half.  As we think about the back half guidance, how should we or where do you think that’s being reflected, it looks like you’re being conservative against a tough comp on the PC growth expectations, where else are you reflecting that conservatism in the guidance?
Chris Liddell

Well I don’t think, when you look at the growth rates, they’re still very healthy in the second half so when we think about product portfolio we actually feel very optimistic for the second half.  Certainly, if there’s you know a substantial economic slowdown you could see PC growth rates come down but we’re guiding for the second half in 11-13% or thereabouts so it’s still very healthy growth from an overall perspective.  You look at individual verticals, probably we can find a couple of soft spots, but each of those individual verticals represents less than 5% of our sales and they’re made up for by strength in other areas.  So when you look at the combined portfolio of our products, what we’re being, it’s just like everyone else about what might happen in the US economy, when you look at the overall suite of product we have and the overall growth rates we have, we actually feel very optimistic.
Adam Holt – J.P. Morgan

Thanks very much.

And the next question comes from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.
Kash Rangan – Merrill Lynch

Hi, thank you very much, when I look at the double digit operating profit percentage of the reported in the entertainment and devices business, despite having a record Xbox unit quarter, how should we think about the margin profile of this business going into the next fiscal year.  Are you at the point that console costs have been driven low enough and you’re getting a healthier mix of software due to rising attached rising attach rate.  It looks to me that the business [unintelligible] for a breakout on operating margins but how do you think about that looking into the next two to four quarters?
Chris Liddell

Yeah, well the first thing to note is as we’ve talked about before the first time we start talking about fiscal year ’09 is in April, so happy to make some comments about it then.  In these calls we’re really trying to focus on this fiscal year, it’s the main purpose.  In terms of some of the underlying drivers though that you can think about when you start populate your model, you know one of the things to point out is a very, very good attach rate for Xbox.  
So we’re looking at a life to date average attach of 7 games per console.  You know, interesting when you look at that now people on average are spending more in terms of the software and accessories than they are on the underlying console itself, so that model of selling the console as a way of generating future revenue is really paying off.  That 7 on average is well above anything historically were on on previous consoles.  So that’s a very healthy leading indicator.  
But the entertainment and devices division is much more than just the Xbox, there’s obviously a music player in there, Windows for Mac and various other parts of it as well, so there’s other dynamics when those mobile that are going to play in terms of our investment in the future.  We’re not making any long term predictions about the margins structure, the one thing that is positive is its clearly profitable and we believe on target to be profitable for the year which is the commitment we made some 18 months ago.
Kash Rangan – Merrill Lynch

Thanks and also one metric that you gave last quarter was the bookings growth rate in the core business being 25%.  What was the same number this quarter, I do see that overall bookings growth rate was 20% but I was just curious about the core business?  That’s it thanks.
Chris Liddell

Yeah, greater than 20%.  I’ll look if I can give you a more detailed number after the call but certainly off my head it’s greater than 20%.
Operator

John Difucci from Bear Stearns, your line is open.
John Difucci – Bear Stearns

Thank you.  Chris, you talked a little bit about US risk and I think you were quoted in Routers I think after the close today saying something similar.  Did you see any of it this quarter, I mean the aggregate results were obviously pretty impressive, but the server and tools division was a little bit below your expectations and that’s really enterprise infrastructure software in aggregate, did you see it and is that what you’re seeing now, is that an area where you might be seeing a little more pressure than perhaps some of the other areas?
Chris Liddell

Actually you have to look really hard to find any weakness in our results in the first half.  So, in terms of server and tools, there was actually a shift to an annuity mix, so that may be what you’re looking at, in fact that’s a positive trend because it means our unearned is up significantly which we reported as you know over $500 million higher than expectations and it’s a reflection of our company’s commitment to our products as a platform in anticipation of some of the server products coming up.  So from an accounting point of view you notice a difference, from an underlying business point of view that’s an incredibly positive trend.
But if you look at the first half of the year, I mentioned over 60% of our sales come from customers outside the US.  If you look at non-US, it grew over 20%, non-US mature markets, if you look at emerging markets, it grew at almost 30%, but the interesting factors that I didn’t say which I’m happy to say is that US markets are up 15%.  So that’s a total our sales in the US for the first half grew by 15%.  Now, clearly if the softness going forward, that would impact that, but that’s still a very healthy growth rate from our point of view.
John Difucci – Bear Stearns

Yeah but I would think you would expect that shift to an annuity at the beginning of the quarter when you gave guidance and it was a little bit shy there but are you saying you just didn’t expect that and it was customer driven?
Chris Liddell

Yup, absolutely.  There’s a vast number of contracts that come up for renewal every quarter and the nature of how those renewals flow through to annuity mix quite significantly quarter on quarter.  But yes it was an unexpected positive surprise.
Colleen Healy

You’re seeing on the low end on server and  tools as revenue is about a $20 million miss and on the unearned balance you’re talking 100’s of millions, net-net on a bookings point, server and tools although the mix was different, the business was just healthier actually than we had expected.
Chris Liddell

Thank you.

The next comes from Ben Thill with Citi Investment Research.
Ben Thill – Citi Investment Research

Thanks, Chris can you characterize any meaningful differences in consumer versus enterprise demand.  Are you seeing any changes in patterns in each of those two divisions?
Chris Liddell

No, they’re broadly in line with our expectations and in terms of the enterprise, as I mentioned and Colleen just referred to, the unearned balance is extremely good and so we’re feeling good about the relative commitment of our enterprise customers to multi-year agreements, so that’s good.  On the, I mentioned about Office and the strength there.  
A lot of very good license earnings sales in the Office area right across the spectrum of businesses from small medium and large businesses.  And lastly on the Xbox side, you know the consumer sales are very good, that’s a good leading indicator of consumer acceptance and I guess the last one would be PC sales overall which poured in to 16% in the quarter was a hit of our expectations.  So really everything was slightly better than what we had hoped for but there wasn’t any significant mix change if you like, all those factors were good.
Ben Thill – Citi Investment Research

And just as a quick follow up, just as you look at the second half of this calendar year, how would you characterize your visibility and I guess the confidence of this macro overhanging the US, doesn’t catch up, I think you mentioned there were a couple soft spots, what gives you confidence that this doesn’t spillover into some of the other sectors in the US and catch up with you later in the year?
Chris Liddell

Well we’ve just gone through our mid-year reviews with where we go country by country and segment by segment across the world and the sales force, so the people who are in charge of delivering.  Their results, sitting in on all of those and listening to them certainly is factored into our guidance.  And you know at this state we’re obviously not giving fiscal year ’09 guidance but again you have to take a step back and look at the overall environment we’re selling into.  
The next six months we feel very good about.  In terms of more general factors, we’re a global company, I talked about the sales mix, I feel good about global GDP over the medium to long term, I think software spending is going to be faster than global GDP and I think we’re going to grow faster than overall global software spending.   So could we be impacted by global slowdown, of course we could, but if you look at the overall growth rates from the products we have and the markets we compete, we still feel very good if we think about our business on a multiyear basis.
Ben Thill – Citi Investment Research

Thanks Chris.

Our next is Jason Maynard with Credit Suisse.
Jason Maynard – Credit Suisse

Hey good afternoon guys.  I had a little different tact on the questioning.  I’m just curious to get your opinion on how you expect the recent EU commission new investigations to play out and what impact you think that may have on not only Vista but I guess perhaps the not yet released Windows 7 product that’s being talked about?
Chris Liddell

Yeah, overall obviously we’ll cooperate fully with the commission’s investigation and provide any and all information necessary.  We’re committed to insuring that we’re in full compliance with their law and our obligations as established by the court.  So I don’t really have a sort of general business comment, happy to leave it at that.
Jason Maynard – Credit Suisse

Is this, post the settlement I guess was like three or four months ago, is this is any way shape or form impacting perhaps your M&A strategy or maybe decisions to do something bigger within the online services area?
Chris Liddell

No, not at all.
Jason Maynard – Credit Suisse

Okay, thank you.
Operator

And the last question comes from Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities.
Brendan Barnicle – Pacific Crest Securities

Thanks so much, Chris I had a quick follow up question on the online business.  Specifically, where is it you’re spending the money for the investment you’re making now.  Is that around infrastructure or R&D, sales, and then secondly, where do you envision that going, is it just always going to be an online advertising business or do you see a point where you charge for content or applications, music, any of these other potential revenue streams?  Thanks.
Chris Liddell

Yeah the investments are across a broad spectrums o we believe to be successful in that business you really need to commit substantially across the whole gamut of investments, so we’re investing in search, improving the relevancy of our search results, focusing on some key verticals like commerce, local entertainment, health.  We’re obviously investing in the advertiser and publisher tools.  You know after our aQuantive acquisitions that’s given us a substantial leg up in the advertising platform area, so we’re continuing to build on that.
We’re investing in content and services through Windows Live and other Live services through the MSN portal and then lastly but not leastly in operational infrastructure.  So a lot of [tapics] going into data centers to improve performance and reliability and generate global sales for the business and some of those costs are feeding through in terms of depreciation.  So there is no one particular area that we’re focused on, we are focused on all the areas and we think to be successful in that business going forward, that’s the approach you have to take.
Brendan Barnicle – Pacific Crest Securities

And then second question in envisioning where it goes?
Chris Liddell

Yeah, just go over that one again.
Brendan Barnicle – Pacific Crest Securities

Yeah, I mean do you ever see a point where you may charge for content, charge for applications or are you always going to be basically in online advertising and advertising driven type model?
Chris Liddell

Well we’re obviously moving to a software plus services world, so there are certainly areas of products that we have where you can see us moving from a license only to a on demand situation.  We already are, in terms of the basic online advertising business as you think about OSB, to a large extent that’s going to be an advertising driven, advertising supported business.  But there will be other parts of the business you know as we already are with CRM, delivered online and charged for on a subscription basis where it won’t be advertising driven.  So we’ll live in a multi-business model world going forward.

Christopher P.Liddell
Thanks, Colleen, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks forjoining us. I’ll start today’s call with highlights from our first quarterperformance and how we see the rest of fiscal 2008 shaping up. 
The first quarter represented an outstanding start to thefiscal year, with every part of the company performing at or aboveexpectations. In particular, we are very happy the consumer demand across ourtotal product range propelled revenue, operating income, and earnings per sharegrowth by 27%, 32%, and 29% respectively. 
Also, we successfully closed aQuantive and a number ofsmaller acquisitions, and we continued setting the platform for future growth withthe availability of products and services, such as an updated live search, BizTalkServer, Silverlight, Performance Point Server, Halo 3, and Office CommunicationServer. 
In terms of our financial performance, there are some keytrends that I would like to highlight. On the revenue side, the benefits of ourmulti-year product cycle are obvious. Q1 was our fastest growing first quarterin seven years, with revenue up 27%, or $3 billion, over Q1 of last year. Theperformance was across all positions, customer segments, channels, andgeographies. 
Looking specifically at the growth coming from our variousgeographies, emerging markets continued to be a strength. The nations that makeup the G7 grew 29% for the quarter, but even better was an over 40% increaseturned in by the combined group of Brazil, Russia, India, and China. 
A quarter like this demonstrates how enlarging ourgeographic presence has positioned us to benefit from the continued worldwideeconomic expansion. 
We also did a good job this quarter of converting revenuegrowth into profit growth. Operating income grew five percentage points fasterthan revenue, expanding our operating margin from 41% to 43%. 
Solid marketing and sales execution, combined withefficiency on operating expenses, kept costs in line with expectations. 
Earnings per share was up 29% over last year, up to $0.45,assisted by our ongoing share buy-back program. Given the start in the firstquarter, the acquisition of aQuantive, and an improved outlook, we areincreasing our revenue, operating income, and earnings per share guidance forthe year. 
We now expect revenue growth of 15% to 17%, and this wouldput the top end of that revenue approaching nearly $60 billion, representing a$2 billion increase over our guidance in July. 
We are also increasing our operating income and earnings pershare guidance, the latter to a range of $1.78 to $1.81, $0.08 to $0.09 higherthan our previous outlook. 
With those high level things for the quarter and 2008, I amgoing to turn the call over to Colleen now for more details on how we closedout the first quarter. 
Colleen Healy
Thanks, Chris. As Chris mentioned, we are off to the fasteststart for revenue and operating income growth of any recent fiscal year. Let meprovide you with details of our financial performance, starting with revenue.I’ll discuss top line financial and business momentum points and then follow upwith revenue performance for each of the business units. Then I’ll review therest of the income statement. All growth comparisons relate to the comparablequarter of last year, unless otherwise specified. 
Revenue increased 27% to $13.8 billion, significantlyexceeding our expectations by over $1 billion. Every business grew atdouble-digit rates, with particular strength in client, the business division,and server and tools, which grew in excess of 20% combined, as well as growthof over 90% by our entertainment and devices division. 
The underlying PC hardware market was strong, with estimatedgrowth of 14% to 16% during the quarter, about three points higher than ourexpectations. From a customer segment standpoint, the business PC shipmentgrowth rate increased almost three times to over 12%, while continuing to beoutpaced by the consumer segment. 
From a geographical point of view, PC growth rates inemerging markets continued to outpace that of mature markets, driven by robustgrowth in Brazil, Russia, India, and China, which grew a combined 20%. Europeand Canada led the mature markets, while we began to see recovery in the U.S.and Japan. 
Our mix of product billings for the quarter was approximately35% from OEMs, 25% from multi-year agreements, 20% from license-only sales, andthe balance from our other businesses. 
Non-annuity sales were particularly robust, which isconsistent with the post product launch stage for Windows Vista and the 2007Office system. Strong annuity licensing performance with enterprise agreementrenewal rates consistent with historical trends drove our unearned revenuebalance 15% higher to $11.6 billion. 
Our [contracted and not billed] balance increased sequentiallyto over $11 billion. When taken together with reported revenue, total bookingfor the company grew an impressive over 30%. 
I will close out the revenue overview by adding that changesin foreign exchange rates added about two percentage points to our overallrevenue growth and was slightly above our forecast heading in to the quarter. 
Now, I will provide revenue highlights by business segment,starting with client. Since Windows Vista became available for consumers,client revenue has grown over 20% on average. This quarter, a rapidly expandingpersonal computer market, progress against software piracy, and three quartersof Windows customers adopting premium versions drove client revenue to $4.1billion, an increase of 25%. 
OEM revenue, which makes up over 80% of client revenue, grew25%. 
After adjusting for three points of revenue recognition fromdeferred revenue, OEM revenue increased slightly faster then OEM unit shipmentsof 20%, due to a higher mix of Premium Windows SKUs. 
Consumer premium units grew over 150%, while businesspremium units grew closer to 11%. As a result, the OEM premium mix increased by16 points to 75%, driven by a 19-point increase in the consumer element ofpremium mix, and partially offset by a three-point decline in the businesselement. 
Because business premium SKUs have a five-to-one pricingimpact over consumer premium SKUs, these changes in the premium mix havelargely offset any impact to revenue. 
Client, commercial and retail licensing, which makes upabout 20% of client revenue, increased 23%, as business customers continue toadd client products to their annuity agreement. 
During the quarter, we saw a 27% increase in the clientvolume licensing portion of the unearned revenue balance. We view this to be apositive leading indicator of intent by businesses to deploy Windows Vista. 
Server and tools revenue increased 16% to $2.9 billion,driven by strong annuity license growth in Windows Server and SQL Server, whichwe are happy to see ahead of the upcoming new releases. 
More specifically, we saw healthy unit growth in our WindowsServer business, particularly in our premium enterprise edition SKU, which grewby over 35%. And SQL Server unit and revenue growth each exceeded 15%. 
During the quarter, we release Silverlight, a Windows homeserver. We also gained significant product development momentum with betareleases of Visual Studio and SQL Server. Since the availability of the initialrelease candidate of Windows Server about a month ago, it has been downloadedover 1 million times, indicating high interest in the coming final products. 
Our consulting revenue increased 32%, as we’ve experiencedhigher utilization rates following the recent business product launches acrossthe company. 
Online services business revenue grew 25% to $671 million,including $80 million for the half quarter of aQuantive revenue since close.Excluding aQuantive, consistent with the way we guided you back in July, growthwas in line with our expectations. Online advertising growth for the quartergrew 33%, or 25% before aQuantive. 
Microsoft Business Division revenue grew 20% to $4.1billion. As a result of our focus on delivering greater desktop value tobusiness customers, we achieved double-digit revenue growth across a broadrange of products within our Office system, unified communications, andbusiness solution areas. 
Looking at how the various customer segments performed,revenue from business customers jumped 25% over the prior year. We benefitedfrom strong, mid-market transactional sales and good Enterprise demand forbusiness productivity infrastructure, such as SharePoint and enterprise [COW]. 
Healthy sales through retailers for the back-to-schoolseason helped drive consumer growth in the quarter. 
Entertainment and devices revenue grew over 90% to $1.9billion, driven by higher-than-expected console sales and Halo 3, whichachieved the biggest entertainment launch day in history. The strong demand forHalo 3 generated approximately $330 million of Microsoft revenue in thequarter, as well as significant consumer interest for the X-Box 360 console. 
X-Box 360 console units increased over 90%, with over 1.8million units sold. This was driven by our August price cut, excitement aroundHalo 3 generating console demand, and an earlier ramp-up to the holiday seasonin anticipation of the most compelling line-up of game titles available on anyplatform. 
In addition to the success of Halo 3, X-Box 360 continues tolead third-party games sales against all current generation platforms, which isnot only good for us and our gaming audience, but also good for our gamedeveloper partners in the X-Box ecosystem. 
For example, according to NPD for the U.S., all four of thecurrent generation third-party titles in the top 10 last month were for theX-Box 360. Infact, over the last year, game developers have seen their titles hit the top 10list 27 times for X-Box 360 compared to only twice for the PS3 and only oncefor the Wii. This helps X-Box 360 software attach rates remain at record levelsfor any console at this stage in its lifecycle. 
Now for the rest of the income statement. Cost of revenueincreased three points to 19% of sales, primarily driven by the high volume ofX-Box 360 unit sales, increased consulting business, and expanded onlineservices operations. 
Operating expenses increased 11%, dropping from 43% of salesto 38% of sales. Expense growth was largely in line with headcount growth andis tracking to our expectations, despite the higher-than-expected revenue asgenerated during the quarter. 
Operating income grew faster than revenue at 32% to $5.9billion, exceeding high-end guidance by $750 million and expanding ouroperating margin by two percentage points. 
Investment income and other totaled $298 million for thequarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 31%, half a point higherthan we previously guided. Cash flow from operations increased 45% to $5.9billion. Cash flow from operations outpaced operating income due to collectionson the large volume of business close at the end of the fiscal year. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 81 million shares, or$2.3 billion of company stock. $2.9 billion settled in the quarter due to thehigh volume of repurchases at the end of fiscal year 2007, and we paid out $938million in dividends to shareholders in the quarter. 
Diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 9.5 billion,down 5% from the prior year as a result of share repurchases. Earnings pershare for the quarter were $0.45. 
So in summary, we are extremely pleased with this quarter’sperformance. Revenue for the fiscal year is off to the fastest start in recenthistory, fueled by strength across our products launched over the last ninemonths. Operating expenses came in line with expectations while generatingsignificantly higher-than-expected revenue. This resulted in operating incomegrowing faster than revenue at an impressive 30% clip. 
With that, let me turn it back to Chris who will provide youwith our second quarter guidance and outlook for fiscal 2008. 
Christopher P.Liddell
Thanks, Colleen. Before we get into the specific guidance,let me outline some of our key underlying assumptions. First, our fiscal 2008forecast assumes stable macro economic conditions through the remainder of thefiscal year. We remain optimistic about the overall outlook for the ITindustry. In mature markets, we haven’t seen a spillover from problems in otherareas of the economy, although clearly the risk of an economic slowdown hasincreased. 
Emerging markets in particular appear healthy to us. Notonly are we getting the benefits of strong growth offshore, but it is assistedby stronger international currencies. The FX impact alone we believe will addabout one point to our yearly revenue growth. 
Overall, our business is benefiting from our diversificationacross products, channels, geographies, and customer segments. 
We are increasing our expectations for PC unit growth forfiscal 2008 by one percentage point to 10% to 12% for the year, and 11% to 13%for the second quarter. Growth rates in both the Asia-Pacific and EMEA regionsappear to be stronger than we thought coming into the year. We estimate thatthe growth rate will continue to be higher in the consumer segment and thebusiness segment, and recent regional trends should continue with growth inemerging markets outpacing that of mature markets. 
Now let me go through our detailed guidance. For the fullyear, we expect our revenue to come in between $58.8 billion to $59.7 billion,growing 15% to 17%, up four percentage points from our last guidance. 
The full year forecast now includes revenue from aQuantive,which contributes approximately one point of revenue growth. The remainingthree point increase from July is driven by an improved outlook for our threebusinesses of client, the business division, and server and tools. 
For the second quarter, we expect revenue of $15.6 billionto $16.1 billion, which represents a year-over-year increase of 25% to 28%. 
With that, revenue guidance in our divisions is as follows:for client, we expect full-year growth to be 12% to 13%, and second quartergrowth to be 62% to 64%, or 13% to 14% excluding certain revenue deferrals inthe prior year. For the full year, we expect OEM revenue to grow in line withthe PC hardware markets. 
On the commercial and retail side of the business, we expectdouble-digit growth for the year from continued demand through our volumelicensing channels. The client growth rate benefits by two percentage pointsfor the full year and by four percentage points in Q2 from recognition ofundelivered elements, consistent with our guidance in July in both percentageand absolute dollars. 
Server and tools revenue should be up 16% to 18% for theyear, and 16% to 17% for the second quarter. We expect double-digit growthacross our server platform products and services. The division is completingthe new releases of Windows Server, SQL Server, and Visual Studio inpreparation for the upcoming launch event starting in February. These productswill allow IT departments to be more productive by providing them with asecure, trusted, scalable and manageable platform that will underpin growth inthe server and tools business over the next several years. 
We forecast revenue in the online service business toincrease 33% to 37% for the year, and 32% to 35% in Q2. This implies onlineadvertising growth in excess of 30% for the quarter and for the year. 
This guidance includes the revenue from aQuantive, whichadds approximately 25 points of growth for Q2 and for the full year. Organicrevenue guidance for the fiscal year is unchanged for both the business groupand advertising. 
We’re aiming to become one of the major players in theonline advertising space, and we are pleased by the progress we are making inputting the building blocks in place. For example, the launch of our new searchproduct with much stronger relevance, using industry standard measurementmethodology; our core algorithmic relevance is now on par with the market leaderand better than all other search engines in the U.S. market today; we saw solidgrowth, 23%, in our display business; we saw rapid growth in our live IDs,growing 19% to over 400 million; our partnership, which we announced yesterdaywith Facebook; and the acquisition and successful integration of aQuantiveduring the quarter. 
We will continue to invest in this business, as we’ve toldyou before. For example, in building a differentiated search experience in thefour high value verticals of commerce, local search and mapping, entertainmentand health, which collectively represent 40% of all global searches. 
Microsoft Business Division revenue should be up 14% to 15%for the year and 31% to 33% in the second quarter. Normalizing for the impactof the technology guarantee and pre-shipment deferrals in the prior year, thesecond quarter growth should be 15% to 16%. 
Looking at the applied growth rate from the second half,I’ll remind you that due to last year’s strong sales of the 2007 MicrosoftOffice system, we will have tough comparisons but are predicting double-digitgrowth nevertheless. 
2008 is another important product launch year for thebusiness division, as we roll out our offering in the important investmentareas of business intelligence and unified communications. These two areas areprojected to have a combined addressable market size of about $65 billion in2009, representing sizable growth opportunities for the division. 
Performance point server, which is our business intelligenceoffering, had over 10,000 customers on its CTP program, an amount larger thansome competitors’ installed bases. 
In unified communications, Office Communication Server alsohas been gathering interest, with over 80,000 beta downloads of the software. 
The entertainment and devices division, we’re forecastingrevenue growth of 15% to 20% for the full year, and flat to down 8% for Q2. OurQ2 revenue growth, however, should be viewed in conjunction with theearlier-than-expected ramp-up of console sales in Q1 in preparation for thecoming holiday season. 
If you look at our overall, for the first six months --that’s the first quarter and the second quarter combined, growth would havebeen about 15%. 
[inaudible] has historically comprised almost half of industryhardware and software sales. With competitively priced console bundles andaccessories, combined with a great first and third-party software titleline-up, we feel very good about our position heading into the holidays. 
We also look forward to bringing more choice to digitalmusic consumers with our expanded families of Zune devices and updated musicmarketplace and new software updates, such as podcasting support, new wirelesssend and sync functionalities, and an attractive user interface. And in appreciationof our early Zune adopters, the new software features will be updateable tocurrent owners’ devices as well. 
Turning back to company-wide performance, operating incomefor the year is expected to be between $23.3 billion and $23.7 billion, increasing26% to 28%. Our higher revenue forecast is responsible for the improvement versusour July guidance, as we expect over half the incremental revenue to flowthrough to operating profits. 
For the second quarter, we expect operating income to be between$5.9 billion and $6.1 billion. 
As a result of the higher operating income guidance, we areincreasing our full year earnings per share results to $1.78 to $1.81,including a $0.01 impact from integration and deal costs associated withaQuantive. This is an increase of $0.08 to $0.09 on a GAAP basis, or $0.09 to$0.10, excluding deal costs. 
For the second quarter, we expect $0.44 to $0.46. Theseearnings then assume both for the year and for the quarter an effective taxrate of 30.5%. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we expect total unearnedrevenue to finish fiscal 2008 up 8% to 10%, in line with our prior guidance.Excluding deferred revenue for undelivered elements, the remaining portion ofunearned revenue should increase 14% to 16%. 
When thinking about sequential changes in unearned revenuefrom Q1 to Q2, we expect the balance to follow historical patterns and remainroughly flat. Contracted not billed should also finish 2008 up from currentlevels. 
It is clearly important, especially in the currentenvironment, that you consider some of the risks of this forecast. These risksinclude competitors, legal, execution, and general market risks, such asforeign exchange rate movement, fluctuations in PC and server hardware growthrates, and consumer acceptance of our new and existing products. 
Additionally, changes in the mix of our billing betweenannuity and license only can have an impact on revenue, operating income, andearnings per share by delaying revenue recognition in the future periods. 
So to wrap up, the first quarter was an outstanding startfor the year. A strong PC hardware market, healthy demand by business customersfor our product, and overwhelming consumer response to the launch of Halo 3helped propel us to the fastest Q1 revenue growth in seven years. 
To put that in context, our revenue base is about 2.5 timeslarger than it was the last time we grew this fast. The fact that we can beatthe law of large numbers is a tribute to our products and sales teams. 
Good execution and cost discipline allowed the majority ofour revenue upside to flow through to operating income, and for the balance ofthis year, we will continue to deliver the strategies for shareholder value weoutlined at our financial analyst meeting in July, in particular, driving ourtop line growth, continuing to invest in technology offerings that will providethe platform for future growth, and using our strong cash flow and balancesheet to benefit shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
With that, I will hand the call over to Colleen so we canget started taking some of your questions. Thank you. 
Colleen Healy
Okay, great. Let’s proceed to questions. We want toaccommodate as many questions as we can from as many of you, so please avoidmulti-part questions and please limit yourself to just one question. Operator,can you please repeat your instructions?
Question-and-AnswerSession

Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes fromHeather Bellini with UBS.
Heather Bellini - UBS
Congratulations on the quarter. I was wondering if you couldgive us an update on your view of Vista adoption thus far, and in particular,how the uptake of premium SKUs, both on the consumer side and also with VistaEnterprise, are tracking versus your original expectations, and how should wethink about that going forward?
Christopher P.Liddell
Clearly we are very happy with the client division overall.As you’ve seen since we launched Vista, the revenue growth has been in excessof 20% three quarters in a row, so the overall [headline] number, very good. 
In terms of the premium mix, also very happy about that.Now, in this case, premium mix brings in both Vista and XP premium sales aswell, and that’s tracking in the mid-70s, so 75% for the quarter, and thatcompares to I believe 59% in the equivalent quarter last year, so up 16 pointsyear over year. So we’re very happy with the adoption of Vista Premium and alsohappy with the old XP Media sales as well. 
The other thing I’ll point to is on the client annuityagreements, which is probably the best leading indicator we can think of ofpeople’s intention to adopt, that’s still very early in the adoption cycle forbusinesses, but the volume licensing portion of our business was up 27% in theclient area, so that’s a very good leading indicator from our point of view. 
And sort of finally, as a wrapper, year-to-date sales arenow 85 million units for Vista. That compares to about 45 million for XP overthe same period, so almost twice as much. 
So it’s still early days but progress, we’re very happy withso far. 
Heather Bellini - UBS
And just on the premium SKUs, would you say that they aretracking above what you guys had expected when you originally launched theproduct?
Christopher P. Liddell
Yes.
Heather Bellini - UBS
Great. Thank you. 
Colleen Healy
Next question, please. 
Operator
Our next question comes from Adam Holt with J.P. Morgan. 
Adam Holt - J.P.Morgan
Good afternoon, and I’ll also let go the congratulations. Ihave two questions on the business uptake. In particular, you had a meaningfulacceleration on the client side in terms of business units and I was hoping maybeyou could detail what you thought was behind that acceleration. 
And then on the Office front, still another quarter ofbetter than 20% Office growth on the business front. Where do you think we areon the enterprise upgrade cycle for Office? Thank you. 
Christopher P.Liddell
Sure, Adam. We’ll start with client. The business saleswere, to be honest, a function of underlying demand, so the PC unit came in at14% to 16% for the quarter overall, compared to our expectations of around 10%to 12%, so we saw a good uplift in overall PC units, and that was both on theconsumer and the business side. 
I think the benefit that we saw on the business aspect wasprobably most particular in some of the emerging markets, so we saw goodstrength in business and that really helped us with the anti-piracy andlegalization aspect of our growth. So if PC units grew by 14% to 16%, ourshipped units that we were paid for grew by 20%, and all of that delta waseffectively a fight against unlicensed PCs, so the growth that we saw in thebusiness segment, in particular internationally, really helped us in terms ofoverall unit sales. So felt very good about that and we still think thatconsumers will grow faster than businesses, but overall a very good story onthe client side. 
In terms of the Office, that has a slightly differentimpact, mainly because it’s a much stronger impact from annuity there ratherthan non-annuity sales, although interestingly, non-annuity sales, whichtypically go to smaller businesses, were strong as well, which is a very directimpact with Office. 
In the annuity sales, which tend to have a multi-yearimpact, you recall I talked last quarter about how we saw a very strong sign-upfor maturing agreements right at the top end of our expectations, and that wasreally a very good leading indicator of people’s acceptance of or expectationthat they would roll out Office, but also the other products in MBD. So it’sclearly strong from our point of view that people are seeing not only a valuein Office, but products that are related to Office, for example, in the unifiedcommunications and business intelligence area. 
So overall, we’re feeling good about the rollout.

Our next question comes from Sara Friar with Goldman Sachs. 
Sara Friar - GoldmanSachs
Good afternoon, everyone. I think everyone is going to saycongratulations, but it is quite an amazing quarter you put up. Following onone more comment on the client Vista adoption side; I think a lot of folks hadthought SP1 would be the catalyst. Why do you think we saw it a little bitahead of that and do you have a timing update on SP1? And then I just have aquick follow-up question, if I may, after that. 
Christopher P.Liddell
Vista adoption, as I say, it is still early and I talkedabout intention to adopt rather than actual adoption. I think you are rightthat certainly some businesses will be waiting for SP1 to roll it out, but interms of their willingness to sign up for the client element of the multi-yearagreements, their intention to roll out is I guess signaled by that. So it isstill early days as to what the actual adoption numbers are, and we think itwill increase during the year and obviously will be helped to some extent bySP1. But some of the leading indicators are what we feel good about. 
Sara Friar - GoldmanSachs
And then just turning to the EDD division, great quarter. Itseems like you do think there was some pull forward on consoles just based onyour guidance. Is there anything implied in your guidance on broader commentaryabout health of consumer spending in the fourth quarter? Are you leavingyourself a little bit more cushion there?
Christopher P.Liddell
No, it’s principally around the pull forward, as youmentioned. And as I said in my prepared remarks, I tend to look at the businessfor the first six months rather than the quarters. In particular in the firstquarter, console sales were 1.8 million units, which is relatively small. So itwas ahead of our expectations, but it’s a quarter where you can beatexpectations because the volumes are small. I mean, Halo was obviously a clearbeat but in terms of consoles, I’d rather think that the volume over that sixmonths, because there’s a lot of stocking in anticipation of Christmas going on,and movements like that. So I feel good about it. There’s no particularsignaling on weakness for Christmas. In fact, we feel very good about theline-up we’ve got, not only from the box itself but obviously the gamesassociated with it as well. 
Sara Friar - GoldmanSachs
Terrific. Okay, well, thanks a lot.

Thanks a lot, Sara. Next question, please.

Charlie Di Bona with Sanford Bernstein, your line is open. 
Charles Di Bona -Sanford Bernstein
I guess no surprise here, but I’m going to go back to thewell on OSB. It was probably the only division that didn’t really outperformsignificantly, only about 10% growth, excluding aQuantive, and the comScoreshare is back down to sort of the lows that they were in your fiscal Q4. 
Especially in light of yesterday’s announcement aroundFacebook, maybe you can give us a little insight into the strategy andexecution here, and is there any shift towards sort of buying traffic andcommunity rather than building it internally? And in general, how do you gobalancing those two alternatives and valuing those two alternatives?
Christopher P.Liddell
First thing to note obviously is we met expectations, so itwasn’t a beat, I agree, but it was a meet, so start with that. 
Underlying business growth or revenue growth, you mentionedthe 10%, which is correct. Clearly in this case it’s a negative from the Accessbusiness going away, so -- if you look at underlying revenue growth, underlyingadvertising revenue growth, it grew in the mid 20s, around 25% for the quarteryear on year, which we think is acceptable. It’s nor certainly stellar. We’dlike to see it higher but it’s acceptable and it is higher than where we guidedat the start of the year, roughly speaking. So I think reasonable progress onthe organic side of the business. 
In terms of putting the building blocks in place and how wetrade off organic growth through inorganic growth, it’s both. The strategy hasbeen both and will continue to be both, so we are investing heavily in the organicaspects of the business, so a lot of investment in particular has gone into thesearch product itself, and we clearly are extremely happy with the improvementswe are seeing on aspects like relevance, which are critical going forward. Weare putting a lot of investment into things like data centers, which arecreating the platform of the future and the experience, so we are increasingCapEx quite considerably there. We are looking at CapEx overall for the year of$3.2 billion to $3.3 billion, about half of which is going into the OSB area.And we are putting investment in some of the verticals that I talked about onsearch organically and all the other areas as well, content on the displayside. 
So there’s a strong organic side, there’s a strong inorganicside, but clearly aQuantive is the most obvious representation of that andwe’re particularly happy that we not only closed aQuantive but we’ve retainedall of the employees. We think that integration has gone extremely well and webelieve that’s going to generate some significant benefits going forward. 
We also did some other smaller acquisitions, ones which wethink are important for the ad platform, like AdECN during the quarter, andthen the announcement yesterday on Facebook, which is a willingness on our partto make a commitment to a multi-year agreement with a partner who we think hasgot some tremendous growth opportunities. 
So we are willing to do both. We are quite clearly willingto suffer an operating loss in that position as a result of those commitments,and we’ll share that there I think both in our financial analyst meeting and inour guidance. 
But to date, in terms of underlying financial metrics, we’reon track. In terms of some of the other things that we wanted to do, if anythingwe are slightly ahead of where we would like to be. 
Colleen Healy

Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Citigroup. 
Brent Thill -Citigroup
Thanks. Good afternoon. Chris, I think your guidance for thefiscal year implies roughly a 40% operating margin, and clearly with Q1, it washigher than 40%. Why do you expect the operating margin will drift to thatlower level for the year? 
Christopher P.Liddell
Overall for the year, we feel very good about the operatingincome growth relative to revenue growth and it will still be an increaseyear-on-year. So there’s some COGS impacts, for example, the mix of COGS duringthe course of the year and we just saw an outstanding performance in the firstquarter, some really, really strong growth in particular in client and MBD. 
We think that out-performance is going to continue, but notat the same rate, so operating margins improve but I think quarter one was justan outstanding one in terms of our ability to take the revenue out-performanceand drive it to the bottom line, and as I say, there is a different COGS mix tothe rest of the year, which impact it as well. 
But overall margin, we are going to grow operating incomefaster than revenue growth this year, which means our margins are going toexpand, and the other impact which you know I’ve talked to you about is weexpect earnings per share to grow very fast as well, backing out all of theone-offs, if you like. We think EPS is going to grow faster than 20% this year,which is the benefit of the operating margin expansion and also the benefit ofthings like share buy-backs flowing through. 
So at this stage of the cycle for the company and for acompany that started to grow earnings per share greater than 20%, upsignificantly from where we were, we feel good about it. 
Brent Thill -Citigroup
And just one quick one, if I could; relative to enterprisedemand, it sounds like it’s improved slightly over the past couple of quarters.Do you think it stabilizes from here or has room to improve even from here?
Christopher P.Liddell
It’s just the renewals. It was back to more traditionallevels in the first quarter and that’s about two-thirds of the three-quartersramp that we talked about, so we saw a particularly good renewal rate in thefourth quarter and we are back down to more traditional levels, but levelswhich we feel obviously very good about, so I don’t think -- we’re notexpecting an out-performance or an increase back to the very, very good levelsthat we saw in the fourth quarter, but if we can maintain traditional levelsand obviously start to sell the new product range that we have coming throughto our existing clients, and hence get the benefits of all of the additionalproducts that we’ve either launched or are going to launch, [that is up] verywell from a business point of view in terms of overall billings growth. 
Brent Thill -Citigroup

Our next question comes from John DiFucci with Bear Stearns.
John DiFucci - BearStearns
Thanks. Just a follow-up question I guess to Brent; themargins were really impressive here, Chris, and even next quarter, you have ameaningful increase in revenue and a pretty I guess meaningful decline inoperating margin. Is there any reason for us to think that you can’t do a lotbetter than what you are saying here? I mean, I understand what you are sayingabout the COGS, but it looks like it is something that can continue.
Christopher P.Liddell
Probably the first thing to do is to normalize of aQuantive,so that may be distorting the numbers. But we are bringing that in for thefirst time and that’s bringing in revenue but no operating income -- in fact,with amortization of intangibles, it will be a slight loss for the year. Sothat’s probably a drag on the margins that you might want to normalize for, orat least give us the benefit of. 
If you take that out, the way that I look at it is what isour ability to meet our operating expenditure guidance and potentiallyoutperform on the revenue side, as opposed to drive the business on a marginbasis. And I would say I’m particularly happy with the fact that we deliveredincreased revenue in the quarter whilst keeping operating expenditure literallyright on guidance. You’ll recall from last year, I was certainly happy that wedelivered the whole year right on operating expenditures, so I feel really goodabout the business groups, discipline, the sales force discipline to a largeextent keeping operating expenses under control, which will allow us to, theextent that we beat revenue, to drive it to the bottom line. 
I can’t promise this is necessarily going to significantlyincrease margins, but it will increase margin every dollar that drops through,and perhaps if you back out aQuantive, that will give you a better comparison. 
Colleen Healy
From a fiscal year on fiscal year, I mean, if you arelooking at organic, fiscal year ’07 you were see us sort of a bit above themid-30s. You pull out aQuantive and legal charges and tax, guaranteed bonds andthe rest of it, for the year you are sort of in that 40% range, and then ofcourse, with Q2, given that X-Box with the hardware is such a big driver forholiday, Q2 for the year, in terms of for the year, you’d probably see a dip,but year on year, when you look at the true underlying organic, pulling outaQuantive and some of those other things, you are going to see I think prettygood margin there, John. 
Christopher P.Liddell
aQuantive will -- to help you, and obviously we’ll have togive more detail as we go on, but aQuantive will add $500 million of revenuefor the year. We will pull out deal costs and IP R&D that we write off ofclose to $100 million, but we’ll still leave in things like amortization ofintangibles, which we know other companies tend to call out. We’ll leave thosein, which means that will be a drag on the operating income of close to acouple hundred million towards this year. So perhaps that will help younormalize for that.

Our next question comes from Kash Rangan from Merrill Lynch.
Kash Rangan - MerrillLynch
Thank you very much. Good to see a quarter like that andmore particularly, the stock break out to a multi-year high. That’s got to lookgood. I just have a question on the online business, Chris. It looks likeyou’ve done a good job restoring or bringing profitability, let’s say, to theentertainment and devices business. At what point are we in making similarprogress on the profitability of the online business, especially with aQuantivebeing integrated into the operations of the company?
And as a follow-up, I was also curious to get your thoughtson the client side. I know you do [inaudible], and correct me if I’m wrong, andthere’s some concerns in certain segments of Wall Street that there might be aninventory issue on Wall Street, especially on the PC side. Intel had a goodquarter, you guys had a good quarter, but with retail sort of weakening or atleast suspected to weaken during the holiday season, who knows, I’m justwondering if you share that concern and if you don’t, what specifically makesyou feel that this inventory build-up could actually lead to sell-through inthe Christmas holiday season? Thanks. 
Christopher P.Liddell
Entertainment and devices and OSB are really at differentparts of their business cycle. It was a very strong commitment from our pointof view to try and drive profitability in the entertainment and devicesdivision this year, and we feel like we are on track for that. So they are on,if you like an upswing to a part of their business cycle where we believe wecan be profitable. 
In the OSB case, there isn’t a primary driver of thebusiness at the moment. The primary driver is to invest in the right areas andcreate the platform for a very strong growth in economic value over the nextfew years. So it’s not one where we are the [clearly the] -- but if we wereprofitable, but it is one where it is not going to be our primary determiner ofsuccess this year. 
I will be keen to ensure that the expenses come in wherethey are. I’ll obviously be keen to see that our revenue growth is in line withexpectations, but assuming we meet those two things, it is going to be a lossfor the year. 
So they are just different -- the businesses are atdifferent parts of their business cycle, and so we have different tests againstthem. 
On the client side, we are not seeing any significantinventory issues that we are aware of, and so from our point of view, if youlook at the guidance, we feel good about PC unit growth guidance of 11% to 13%.Anything in double digits or greater we think is good and that’s like a sell-innumber, using your terminology. So we think that’s good and we think we shouldbe able to drive OEM units in our area around that same level. So there’s noparticular issues of significance that we are aware of. 
Kash Rangan - MerrillLynch
It just looks like the emerging markets and the [inaudible]countries, perhaps business there is accelerating and that’s why your OEM unitsare looking better than they have in the last few quarters?
Christopher P.Liddell
That’s absolutely right. Those countries really did anoutstanding job -- countries like Russia, the business overall grew there bygreater than 100% in the OEM area and client grew by something like 50%. Sosome of those countries are growing at a tremendous rate, which is a functionof the underlying economies growing well, but as we see business growth inthose areas and a greater desire to obviously have legitimate PCs, we areseeing good progress on piracy as well, and that’s really helping us with ouroverall OEM unit. 
Kash Rangan - MerrillLynch

Our next question comes from Kirk Materne with Banc ofAmerica.  
Kirk Materne - Bancof America
Thanks very much. Chris, I might be jumping ahead a littlebit here, but clearly you guys haven’t seen any slowdown in terms of demandaround either SQL Server or Windows Server 2008 in front of those launches. Whatis your expectation in terms of the impact of those launches on the growthrates? Do you think that we’ll see demand come in at a steady pace? Or do youexpect that as we get into the back half of the year, that can help acceleratethe growth rates in that division? Thanks. 
Christopher P. Liddell
I think it will help continue the growth rates that we’veseen, to a large extent. You have to realize that the structure of our businessreally has matured significantly to one that’s driven much more aroundmulti-year expectations. So people are -- to the extent we’re seeing strengthin annuity agreements now, it’s an anticipation of those products. The factthose product launch won’t in itself drive an enormous amount of accountingactivity. We’ll see that over a slow -- to a large extent, that’s the samephenomena we talked about with Vista. These things will happen over time aspeople adapt and adopt the particular systems.
But from a revenue and economic point of view, ourrelationship with our customers, our ability to continue to sign them up anddrive growth is much more of a multi-period rather than a single event basedphenomena, and we just think a continuation of very strong products rolling outcontinuously quarter after quarter, year after year, is the best way of drivingthat business. 
Kirk Materne - Bancof America
Just a really quick follow-up on Windows Server 2008, thebeta for Veridian is still expected to be released with that, with thefull-blown version released 180 days afterward? Is that still on track?

BrandonBarnicle - Pacific Crest Securities
Thanks so much. I just have two quick ones. Chris, first onpremium edition, obviously a great move, year over year up 75%. As we have SP1come, where we potentially get more enterprises pulling in, can we see thatpremium edition even move up higher still? 
And then secondly, over on aQuantive, have you given anythought again to the agency business and whether that’s something that stayswithin the business or needs to be divested? Thanks. 
Christopher P.Liddell
Yeah, we are very happy with XP business. That’s continuedto do a great job. I mentioned before, I think the integration has goneextremely well. As far as we can tell, the employees are very happy, who arerunning the XP business in particular on a standing independent basis andreally letting them continue getting on with their life. We think it is a verygood business and no intention to do anything other than continue to run it. 
On the client side -- just go over your question again,sorry. 
Brandon Barnicle -Pacific Crest Securities
Premium edition, 75%, very impressive. Can we see it go to85%?
Christopher P.Liddell
We’re just looking -- in terms of our guidance and ourthoughts and what’s embedded with, we believe we can continue to drive that atover 70%, but too early to predict anything higher than that. 
Brandon Barnicle -Pacific Crest Securities
And would SP1 have any impact on accelerating that?
Christopher P.Liddell
It might help but those rates of 70% are very high, so -- itmight assist but it may just simply just help us continue at that sort of rate.So we are not [anticipating] a particular pick-up as a result of that alone.

Good afternoon and welcome to the Microsoft fourth quarter fiscal year 2007 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Colleen Healy, General Manager, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
 Colleen Healy
 Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. This afternoon I'm joined by Chris Liddell, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Corporate Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel. 
Today's call will start with Chris providing some key takeaways for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 and an overview of expectations for fiscal year 2008. I will then provide detail around our fourth quarter results, and then turn it back to Chris for a more detailed discussion of our guidance for the full year and first quarter of fiscal 2008. After that, we will take your questions. 
Our earnings release includes an addendum of financial highlights which contains more detailed information about revenue, operating expenses and other items. We have also posted our quarterly financial summary slide deck, which is intended to follow the flow of our prepared remarks in order to assist you. 
The slide deck offers highlights from the quarter, outlines our guidance, and provides a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures that we will talk about today. You can find the earnings release, the financial highlights and the quarterly financial summary slide deck on the investor relations website at www.Microsoft.com/msft. 
Today's call will be recorded. Please be aware that if you decide to ask a question, it will be included in both our live transmission as well as any future use of the recording. As always, shareholders and analysts can listen to a live webcast of today's call at the Microsoft Investor Relations website. A replay of the call will be available at this same site through the close of business on July 19, 2008.

Actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release and the comments made during this conference call and in our 2006 Form 10-K, subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. 
With that, let me now turn it over to Chris. 
 Chris Liddell
Thanks Colleen, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll start today's call with highlights from last fiscal year's performance and then give you an overview of our expectations for fiscal 2008. 
Our quarter 4 performance capped an extremely strong year for our company, and helped set the stage for fiscal 2008 to be another year of double-digit revenue, operating income and earnings per share growth. 
I'm extremely pleased with the traction our sales force and partners are experiencing with business customers, evidenced by billings growth in the quarter for enterprise agreements in excess of 25%, and non-annuity licensing up of over 15%. When you combine those figures with billings for OEM and packaged products each growing 10% plus in the quarter, you'll see that demand was strong across all of our channels and customers. 
Looking at our full year results, fiscal 2007 was a year of $7 billion of revenue growth, fueled by robust customer acceptance of products in both our emerging and mature businesses including Windows Vista, Microsoft Office 2007, SQL Server, Windows Server, and Xbox 360 consoles. Our core businesses accounted for $5 billion of absolute revenue growth, with the business division, client, and server and tools growing 13%, 14% and 16%, respectively for the year. 
Operating income for the year also grew double-digits. We were able to achieve this while still be being able to make a number of significant investments in our businesses. For example, the launch of over 40 new products into the marketplace, as well as a number of updates and enhancements to our online service offerings, continued development of a number of upcoming products such as new versions of Windows Server, SQL Server, and Visual Studio, the enhancement of our online service infrastructure by continuing to refine adCenter; increasing our database capacity; and necessary investments in Xbox customer satisfaction. 
We also announced eight strategic acquisitions including: aQuantive, to provide the advertising industry with a world-class, Internet-wide advertising platform; Tellme, for its voice response services; and Softricity for its application virtualization and streaming capabilities. 
Earnings for the year came in at $1.42, up 18% over last year, which was faster than both revenue and operating income. 
Finally, during fiscal ‘07 we made significant progress on our strategy of returning cash to shareholders. Last year at this time we announced authorization for programs to repurchase up to $40 billion worth of our stock over five years. Today, one year after that announcement, I am happy to say that we have passed the halfway mark on the program by repurchasing approximately $25 billion worth of our stock during the year. 
When you combine the share repurchases we made this year with the $3.8 billion worth of dividends paid, we returned about 175% of operating cash flow to shareholders. 
Now I would like to move to our outlook for fiscal ‘08. Given the good exit from fiscal ‘07 we are increasing our revenue, operating income and earnings per share guidance for next year on an absolute basis. We expect revenue growth of 11% to 13%, with operating income and earnings per share growing even faster than that. 
I'm particularly pleased that the high end of our guidance reflects each of our businesses growing revenue at double-digit rates for the year, especially given our robust performance in fiscal ‘07. 
Looking to our product lineup in ‘08, next year represents another significant launch year for the company. We will intensify our pursuit of important market opportunities for the company with product launches in business intelligence, unified communications, security and business applications. 
By the time we exit next year, we will have refreshed a major portion of our server lineup within a period of 15 months with the addition of new versions of Windows Server and SQL. Additionally, the consumers will have a great lineup of first and third-party games heading into the holidays, led by the release of Halo 3, plus continuing enhancements to our Windows Live services. 
With those high level themes for 2007 and 2008, I am going to turn the call over to Colleen now for more details on how we closed out last year. 
 Colleen Healy
Thanks, Chris. As Chris mentioned, the fourth quarter delivered a strong finish to the year with revenue near the high end of our guidance provided on the April earnings call. Specifically, demand for our offerings was excellent, with revenue growing 13% and core bookings increasing over 20%, characterized by high annuity revenue growth, driven by outstanding field sales force execution on enterprise agreement renewals. This speaks not only to the healthy customer acceptance of the products recently launched, but also to the anticipation of our offerings still to come. 
Let me provide you with details of our financial performance, starting with revenue. I'll discuss top line, financial and business momentum points, and then follow-up with revenue performance for each of the business units. Then I'll review the rest of the income statement. All growth comparisons I mention relate to the comparable quarter of last year, unless otherwise specified. 
As I mentioned, revenue grew 13% to $13.4 billion, driven by client, the Microsoft business division and server and tools. Online services also had a good quarter. Each of these four businesses grew in the mid to high teens, and collectively at 16%. 
The underlying PC hardware market remained robust, with estimated growth of 11% to 13% during the quarter, about a point higher than our expectations. PC shipment growth rates in emerging markets continue to outpace that of mature markets, and consumer PC shipment growth outpaced that of the Business Segment. Every region, except the US and Japan, increased PC shipments at double-digit rates. 
Our mix of product billings for the quarter was approximately 30% from OEMs, over 40% from multi-year licensing agreements, around 15% from license-only sales, and the balance from our other businesses. 
Over the past couple of years we have seen a mix shift from license-only sales to annuity agreements, driven by standing adoption of enterprise agreements. Enterprise agreement renewal rates exceeded the high end of our historical range of 66% to 75%. We are delighted that the value proposition from our current product lineup and future roadmap -- beyond the recently launched flagship desktop product even -- are resonating with customers. 
This strong annuity licensing performance drove our unearned revenue balance 16% higher to $12.6 billion and our contracted, not billed balance was driven higher on both a sequential and year-over-year basis, exceeding $10 billion at the end of June. As a result, total bookings grew over 15%, and core bookings of client, Microsoft business division and server and tools increased over 20%, as I previously mentioned. 
I'll close out the revenue overview by adding that changes in foreign exchange rates added about 2 percentage points to our overall revenue growth. Now I will provide revenue highlights by business segment. 
Client revenue grew 14% to $3.8 billion, characterized by strong OEM revenue growth, driven by continued demand for Windows Vista and a healthy PC hardware market. OEM revenue increased 15% and includes 3 points of revenue recognition from undelivered elements. Adjusting for this impact, OEM revenue grew roughly in line with OEM unit shipments at 11%. 
OEM premium mix was 72%, a 17 percentage point increase over this period last year. This was driven by a 20 percentage point increase in the consumer element of premium mix, and around a 3 percentage point decline in the business element. Given the over 5:1 pricing uplift we received from the business premium SKUs over consumer premium SKUs, these changes within the premium mix have largely an offsetting impact to revenue. 
For further background on this new disclosure, we have included a slide in the earnings deck on our website that illustrates these metrics, as well as lists of SKUs comprising each of the consumer and business premium mixes. 
Client, commercial and retail licensing increased 7%. Businesses are recognizing the value that Windows Vista and Software Assurance provides them, as evidenced by high renewal and new annuity attach rates, driving about a 25% increase in the volume licensing portion of the unearned revenue balance. 
Server and tools revenue grew 15% to $3.1 billion, driven by SQL Server, Windows Server, Visual Studio and consulting services revenue. Fiscal 2007 capped a decade of consecutive years of double-digit revenue growth for SQL Server. During the quarter, significant product development momentum was achieved with beta releases of the upcoming versions of Windows Server and Visual Studio, and a community technology preview of SQL Server 2008. 
In our online services business we saw advertising revenue growth of 33%, exceeding our expectations. Search ad revenue benefited from both increased search queries and revenue per search, while display ad revenue enjoyed both increased number of page views and revenue per page view. Overall, online services business revenue grew 19% to $688 million. 
Microsoft business division revenue grew 19% to $4.6 billion, beating high end guidance by over $150 million. Highlights in the quarter included solid revenue growth through enterprise agreements for Office, and continued momentum for Share Point. Enterprise agreement momentum continued after the launch of the Office 2007 system, and renewal rates are higher now than they were a year ago. 
We are also pleased with the results of our Dynamic business, which showed healthy performance across both the ERP and CRM product lines, driving a 24% increase in dynamic customer billings. An impressive 85,000 new seats of our dynamic CRM offering were sold during the quarter. 
Consistent with our guidance, entertainment and devices revenues decreased 10% to $1.2 billion as a result of lower Xbox 360 sales. Software and accessory attach rates remained at record levels, and we passed the 7 million member mark for Xbox Live. 
During the quarter, Halo 3 concluded beta testing, and on September 25th will lead the charge of hotly anticipated game titles into this 2007 holiday season. Entertainment and devices achieved its goal of selling over 1 million Zune units on a sell-in basis in its first eight months in the market. 
Licenses for Windows Mobile-based phones grew in excess of 75% to end the year with sales of over $11 million, and an increased unit market share in the smart phone category. 
Now for the rest of the income statement. Positive revenue increased 52%, primarily driven by a charge relating to the current and enhanced Xbox 360 warranty policies that were announced earlier this month. At this time, let me provide you with the details of that charge, now that they have been finalized. First, the total amount was $1.06 billion, within the range we provided a couple of weeks ago. 
Second, the makeup is largely consistent with the guidance we provided with about half of the total charge driven by existing warranty policies and the other half driven by the new warranty enhancements. Of the total amount of the charge, approximately 35% is attributable to inventory valuation adjustment. Before the Xbox 360 charge, cost of revenue would have increased 5% year over year. 
Other operating expenses increased 13%, excluding legal charges of $351 million in the year-ago period. Expense growth was driven by headcount-related costs and sales support cost for our enterprise software advisory channel partners. 
Operating income was $4 billion. Excluding the impact of the Xbox 360 charge and certain legal charges in the year-ago period, operating income for the quarter would have increased 19% to $5 billion. Investment income and other totaled $295 million for the quarter. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 29% to align to our annual effective tax rate of 30% for fiscal 2007. Before non-recurring items the effective tax rate for the year would have been 31%. 
Cash flow from operations increased 34% to $4.4 billion. During the quarter we repurchased 243 million shares, or $7.4 billion of company stock, of which $7.2 billion settled in the quarter. We paid out $952 million in dividends to shareholders. 
Diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 9.7 billion, down 6% from the prior year as a result of share repurchases. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.31, which included $0.08 related to the Xbox charge. Before this charge, earnings would have been $0.39 per share. 
So in summary, during the quarter we made a needed investment into our Xbox business to assure customers that we fully stand behind our products. Before this charge, the fourth quarter was a strong end to fiscal 2007 with double-digit revenue, operating income and EPS growth, robust bookings and solid progress on the fiscal 2008 product pipeline. 
With that, let me turn it back to Chris, who will provide you with our expectations for the first quarter and all of fiscal 2008. 
 Chris Liddell
Thanks, Colleen. I'm going to spend my remaining time on the call talking about what we see for the full year ahead and first quarter. Before we get into the specific guidance, let me outline some of our key assumptions. 
The fiscal 2008 forecast generally assumed a continuation of the economic conditions and demand from where we exited in 2007. Our forecast did not include any significant unexpected impacts from foreign exchange rate movements. 
We expect PC unit demand to continue to remain healthy with growth rates similar to what we saw in 2007. Specifically, we expect PC unit growth for fiscal 2008 to be 9% to 11% for the year and between 11% to 13% for the first quarter. We estimate that growth rates will continue to be higher in the consumer segment than in the business segment, and recent regional trends should continue with growth in emerging markets outpacing that of mature markets. 
Now let me go through our detailed guidance. For the full year we expect our revenue to come in between $56.8 billion to $57.8 billion, growing 11% to 13%. This represents a 1 percentage point improvement on the high-end and is about $300 million better in absolute dollar terms from our April guidance. The $5.7 billion to $6.7 billion yearly represents yearly increases driven by expected solid performance across our five segments. In the first quarter, we expect revenue of $12.4 billion to $12.6 billion, which represents an increase of 15% to 17%. 
With that revenue guidance in our divisions is as follows: 
For client, we expect full year growth to be 9% to 10%, and quarter one growth to being 15% to 16%. For the first quarter we expect OEM revenue to grow faster than the PC hardware market due to a higher premium mix than the year-ago quarter and to be in line for the full year. 
On the commercial and retail side of the business, we expect double-digit growth for both quarter one and the year from continued demand through our volume licensing channels. Combined growth rate benefits by 3 percentage points in Q1 and 2 percentage points for the full year from recognition of undelivered elements. As in our April call, we have included a slide in our slide deck containing additional information on the impact of client revenue. 
Server and tools revenue should be 14% to 15% for the year and 11% to 12% for the first quarter. Coming off another impressive year in fiscal 2007, Server and tools is expected to again achieve double-digit revenue growth, while delivering the next wave of server innovation with the upcoming February launch of the new versions of Windows Server, SQL Server and Visual Studio. Together, these products form a highly reliable and secure next-generation enterprise platform, which will fuel growth in the server and tools business over the next several years. 
We forecast revenue in the online services business to increase 10% to 13% for the year and 10% to 11% in Q1. This implies advertising growth in excess of 20% for the year and for the quarter. Fiscal 2008 will bring many important structural enhancements to our online services business. 
First, we expect to close both of our recently announced acquisitions for ScreenTonic and aQuantive in the first quarter. These acquisitions represent important next steps as we continue building out our vision of a centralized advertising platform that allows advertisers exposure across the various IP-enabled media. 
Second, we will be making usability improvements by providing better integration between our Windows Live services. 
Third, we will continue to build out our data centers to provide capacity for online services that can be used across the company. 
I mentioned our acquisition of aQuantive, and I want to clarify that the guidance we are giving you for the company and for OSB does not include the financial impact of aQuantive. We expect to close the aQuantive acquisition in August, sometime after the shareholder vote. Assuming a positive vote and a subsequent close, we plan to update our corporate guidance for the inclusion of that business on our next earnings call in October. 
As we stated in May, the transaction will have revenue and operating expenses, but we do not expect a significant affect to fiscal 2008 operating income and earnings per share, excluding transaction costs. 
Microsoft business division revenue should be 11% to 12% for the year and 14% to 15% in the first quarter. Q1 will continue to benefit from strong customer acceptance of the Microsoft Office system. 
Fiscal 2008 represents another important launch year for the business division, with the impending releases of Office Communications Server, Performance Point Server and a new versions of Dynamic CRM. These products continue Microsoft's push into the field of unified communications, business intelligence and business applications. While overall revenue growth remained healthy, direct comparisons for the second half of 2008 are more difficult due to our out performance in 2007. 
For the entertainment and devices division, we're forecasting revenue growth of 10% to 19% for the full year and 30% to 40% for Q1. Growth in our most profitable revenue streams will be a key driver in achieving our goal of segment profitability in fiscal 2008. 
We had the best first and third-party software title lineup we have ever had, highlighted by the launch of Halo 3 this September. These games, combined with Xbox accessory attach and an expanding line of Xbox LIVE installed base, set us up for an excellent year in our Xbox business. 
2008 will be another year of continued momentum for our mobile communications business as well. We expect to sell over 20 million licenses for Windows Mobile-based phone as our carrier and OEM partners roll out a broad and compelling lineup of devices based on Windows Mobile 6. 
Getting back to companywide performance, operating income for the year is expected to be between $22.2 billion and $22.7 billion, increasing 20% to 22% and 12% to 15%, excluding certain charges in fiscal 2007. The higher revenue forecast is responsible for the improvement versus our April operating income guidance. For the first quarter, we expect operating income to be between $5 billion and $5.2 billion. 
As a result of the higher operating income guidance, we have increased our full year earnings per share results by $0.01. Therefore diluted earnings per share for the year are expected to come in at $1.69 to $1.73. For the first quarter we expect $0.38 to $0.40. These earnings assume an effective tax rate of 30.5%. 
From a balance sheet prospective, we expect total unearned revenue to finish fiscal 2008 up 7% to 10%. Excluding undelivered elements, the remaining portion of our unearned revenue should increase 13% to 16%. Contracted not billed should also finish 2008 up from current levels. 
When thinking about sequential changes in unearned revenue from quarter four 2007 to quarter one 2008, we expect the sequential decrease from the fourth quarter to be about 10%, due to the large amount of billings in that fourth quarter. 
When thinking about the guidance we just provided you, I would suggest that you consider some of the risks. These risks include competitive, legal, execution and general market risks, as well as customer acceptance of our new and existing products and fluctuations in PC and server hardware growth rates. Additionally, changes in the mix of our billings between and annuity and license-only can have an impact on GAAP revenue, operating income and earnings per share by delaying revenue recognition into future periods. 
So to wrap up, fiscal 2007 was an excellent year from my perspective. Launches of Windows Vista, the 2007 Microsoft Office System, Exchange 2007, Zune, and Windows Mobile 6 have brought new capabilities into the marketplace so it is exciting to see them off to such strong starts. 
Many of the same factors that helped us be successful in 2007, such as a healthy PC hardware market, customer acceptance of our new versions of Office and Windows, an impressive lineup of new product offerings, as well as solid execution by our R&D and sales and marketing teams will help propel us into the next fiscal year. 
In ‘08 we're looking to deliver another year of double-digit revenue, operating income and earnings per share growth. Next year product releases represent significant improvements over our existing products, as well as a continued push into new areas for the company. Given the operational backdrop and our ability to generate meaningful free cash flow for the company, we will look to continue to execute on our strategy of returning cash to shareholders. 
This brings me to the end of my financial comments. I'm very much looking forward to catching up with many of you at our financial analyst meeting next week. As a result of your feedback, we have made some slight adjustments to the overall flow of the day. There will still be presentations by Bill, Steve and the senior management team, but we have also allowed more executive interactions than in prior years, with Q&A sessions throughout the day with all the speakers. 
We have left some time now for your questions. I will hand the call over to Colleen so we can get started. Thank you. 
 Colleen Healy
Great. Let's now proceed to questions. We want to accommodate questions from as many people as possible, so please avoid multi-part questions and limit yourselves to just one question. Operator, will you please repeat your instructions? 
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
 (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Charlie DiBona - Sanford Bernstein. 
 Charlie DiBona - Sanford Bernstein
Thank you, operator. Chris, I guess it will come as no surprise that I have a question about the online services group. I know you promised more metrics next week, but more generally, you have had some solid results here and a good recovery of search share by all the independent metrics in the last month, both sequentially and year over year. But there has been some speculation that those gains were driven by special programs. Now your Q1 guidance points to a relatively significant deceleration of that business. Can you talk a little bit about the strategy here and about the sustainability of particularly last month's momentum? 
 Chris Liddell
Yes. Let me talk about the quarter and then how it flows through to the year. From the quarter point of view, the underlying advertising revenue was up 33%. The good news from my perspective was that really it was across the board. So we had good search volumes, we had good monetization of those search volumes. We are lapping the transition to adCenter so we're getting some benefit, if you like, from revenue per search uplift, as well as the overall volumes. 
Better than that growth rate is also on our display business, which doesn't tend to get talked about as much. That was up a healthy number in terms of volume and monetization as well, so it was a good quarter all around. 
Vis-a-vis next year, inside the guidance is revenue growth in advertising of greater than 20%. Now the comparables start to get harder because we're off a bigger base, obviously, and we don't have for the full year quite as strong a momentum in terms of the adCenter transition. I would just say mid 20s or higher is a good result for the business overall. I think that clearly if we can do better than that, that's great, but that's not a bad result. 
In terms of the last part of your question on how much we were assisted in the fourth quarter by some of the one-off impacts, we were certainly helped by that but I think the interesting thing from my point of view is not necessarily the sustainability of that because that was one or two months. It’s just that when we put a new product into the marketplace, it is capable of shifting share. I am certainly not going to extrapolate that through next year but I think it is interesting from, if you like, an experiment point of view that when we try something different, we were able to get some movement in the market in a relatively short period of time. 
I haven’t built a lot of that into next year and we’ll wait to see other more sustainable products have some influence but overall, I think next year, having revenue of advertising growing at greater than 20% off a higher base is at least a good starting point at this stage. 
 Colleen Healy
Thank you, Charlie. Next question, please. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Heather Bellini with UBS. 
Heather Bellini - UBS
Thanks, Chris and Colleen. I was wondering if you could comment on two things; one, where do you think the premium mix could go? It went from 71, I believe to 72 this quarter. Again, that’s much higher than what you had forecasted before you went into the Vista cycle but where do you think we could go, especially as we get into the heart of consumer spending maybe more around back to school and holiday? 
Also, could you comment on the significance of SP1 for Vista adoption? Do you have any comments on timing? Thanks. 
Chris Liddell
With the premium mix, we think that sort of level is sustainable through next year, so we would expect the same sort of premium mix next year as for this year. We will see a difference in business premium versus consumer premium. As we talked about last quarter, we thought we would give you more visibility into what’s happening in those two different segments or those two different components of the premium mix because they have such different monetization impact, the business premium having much more significance than the consumer premium. 
Colin shared with you the makeup of those numbers. In terms of next year, because we expect consumer growth to be higher than business growth in terms of PCs, we would still expect a mix shift in the premium segment towards the consumer premium but the overall premium mix for the company to be relatively healthy and high in the 70 odd percent range. So we think it’s sustainable at that level but with a change inside business and consumer. 
In terms of SP1, clearly there will be an SP1 but it looks like we’re not talking about exactly when that is. We don’t see it as a massive driver of uptake in its own right. It’s early days yet and we are broadly happy with how we are seeing Vista adoption, both from a consumer and a business point of view. 
We were always expecting, and I think we talked about this for the last two or three quarters, that the business uptake would be driven by their needs rather than the availability of Vista per se, so that’s going to be progressive over the next 12 to 18 months and I think will be relatively independent of when the first service pack comes out. 
Heather Bellini - UBS
Thank you. 
 Colleen Healy
Thanks a lot, Heather. Next question, please. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Sara Friar with Goldman Sachs. 
Sara Friar - Goldman Sachs
Good afternoon, guys. In the entertainment and device area, that guidance for fiscal year ’08 is quite a wide spread. Chris, could you just talk us through what the major swing factors will be? Also, you did say the profitability of the segment for FY08 but can you give us any sense on timing? Could Halo 3 launching at the end of September help drive profitability as early as December? 
Chris Liddell
It’s profitability overall for the year and that’s the key from my point of view. Because of the seasonality in that business, you could see some quite different swings in profitability on a quarter by quarter basis, not only because of Halo that you mentioned but obviously the Christmas quarter is a substantial one from a console and gaming point of view. So it won’t necessarily be a linear improvement during the course of the year, although in terms of COGS it will help. The COGS will progressively degrade through the year but the volumes will go up and down with the quarter. 
So profitability overall for the year but it will be non-linear in the way that it rolls out during the course of the year. 
In terms of the width of the guidance, I guess that is purposeful. It’s one of those businesses which, from a demand point of view, is relatively hard to anticipate. Obviously console demand in itself is a big variable there but the other thing and better than that, to be honest, we have a pricing strategy for the next 12 to 24 months that’s embedded in that and a console strategy as well, and those two are related to each other. 
At this stage, we’re keeping relatively quiet about that from a competitive point of view. We really don’t want to signal anything, so that will become more clear as the year comes through. But at this stage we’re keeping, if you like, a relatively wide range to accommodate that. 
Sara Friar - Goldman Sachs
Could I ask one more quick follow-up? On the macro environment, a number of other tech and others have alluded to a much better spending backdrop. I would just love to hear your quick thoughts on any changes you are seeing in the various geographic areas, where you are seeing strength and weakness. 
Chris Liddell
We are certainly seeing strength in all of the emerging markets. For example, countries like Russia which has just had a phenomenal year for us, so some of those Eastern Europe countries, South America and obviously the Asian countries are very strong form our perspective, albeit off a relatively small basis. 
In terms of overall level of spending, we aren’t seeing a significant positive there. The thing that we believe that we are seeing is a higher share of the wallet from some of our customers and that’s reflected in the relatively higher renewals that we are getting and people’s uptake of the products. 
So from our fields point of view, we are seeing a really healthy and encouraging trend from just being a desktop software provider to being much more of an infrastructure provider to enterprises. So we aren’t necessarily seeing the amount of their spending going up but we believe that the amount that they are spending with us on the suite of products that we’ve got, not only the ones obviously that we’ve launched in the last couple of years but the ones that are coming up, is increasing in what we consider to be a promising way. 
Sara Friar - Goldman Sachs
Got it. Thanks a lot. 
 Colleen Healy
Thanks, Sara. Next question, please. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Citigroup. 
Brent Thill - Citigroup
Thanks. Chris, on the client guidance for fiscal ’08, it seems it’s fairly prudent considering the industry is expecting a reacceleration in PC unit growth for the second-half of this year. Can you just talk to some of the characteristics and why you are expecting that line to slow down more than any of the other lines that you’ve given guidance for the year? 
Chris Liddell
If you start with PC unit growth rates, and that’s clearly the main driver inside there, we are expecting for next year, as I mentioned on the call, around 9% to 11%, so we’re sticking pretty much in line with industry expectations. 
We think we can grow OEM units at the top end of that range because of our continued progress that we make in piracy, so we think we can grow units at the top end of that range. And then we’ll be assisted to some extent by the Vista revenue recognition that we talked about on the last couple of calls. 
But because of the premium mix change, and this is something that Steve obviously alluded to in February and we talked a bit about on the last few calls, we will lose a couple of percentage points between OEM unit growth and OEM revenue growth, you know, the strong drive in emerging markets, growth in emerging markets, and consumers will take a little bit of a shaving relative from revenue relative to units. 
Lastly, from our perspective in terms of revenue growth, the commercial and retail will have a strong comparable in FY07, so the growth rate will be relatively hard to repeat, given the FTP spike that we had in fiscal year ’07. 
So there’s a lot of moving parts in the way that we look at it, but if you start with PC unit growth, we think we can grow OEM units at the top end of that and we think we can grow client revenue overall broadly equal to OEM units at around that 9% to 10% mark. 
So we think that will be a good healthy result from our perspective, but in order to get out-performance on that, we’d have to see PC units at stronger levels than that. 
Brent Thill - Citigroup
Just a quick follow-up; Longhorn is still on track for a calendar year ’07 ship? 
 Colleen Healy
No update on the Longhorn. You can expect second-half calendar ’07 for RTM. 
Brent Thill - Citigroup

Thank you. Our next question comes from John DiFucci with Bear Stearns. 
John DiFucci - Bear Stearns
Thank you. I have a question, Chris, on cash flow. It looks like other current assets are down a little bit and there’s a note right at the end of the press release, or the report on your website. I just want to make sure I understood it. It looks like this year relative to a year ago benefited by about $1.2 billion because you were not building X-Box inventory, so just I guess confirm that that’s actually true. 
We know that you had some channel issues where there was an over supply to the channel in the December quarter, but this 35% of that $1 billion charge due to inventory valuation adjustments, is this at all related to that? What exactly are you adjusting here? I mean, does that in any way allude to what you were talking about as far as your pricing strategy going forward or do you have to go in and fix all these things? And does that have to do with the three flashing light issue or just any issue? Sorry for such a long one there. 
Chris Liddell
Let me try and strike all the components and hopefully I get them all. In terms of the cash flow impact, yes, there is a difference between our billed inventory a year ago and a declining inventory situation this year, so that is certainly true from a cash flow point of view. 
In terms of the write-down component of the charge associated with X-Box, that is a write-down on the balance sheet of the holding costs of those X-Box, so that’s a non-cash charge clearly but it does have an influence on the overall carrying costs of the boxes that are associated with that, a direct charge to that. 
In terms of the linkage between that and the three flashing red lights, it is not so much a direct linkage. There’s obviously an indirect linkage in the sense that because of that, as people return them we need to repair them, but this is very much, the inventory write-down is very much a write-down of the inventory that we have had returned to date that we believe that we will not be able to sell as a repaired unit, and hence it’s impaired from a valuation perspective. 
It is clearly all part of the same manufacturing issue but it is slightly different from a physical and hence an accounting perspective. 
Did I grab all the parts to your question? 
John DiFucci - Bear Stearns
I think you did but one of the things here with this write-down and some of those other components, other 15% -- I’m having a hard time understanding why this is like a special charge and it’s taken out of this non-GAAP, the non-GAAP numbers for you. 
Chris Liddell
I think the important thing from my point of view is the visibility of what we did and what we tried to do a couple of weeks ago -- I’d be happy to go over it again -- is give people all of the components of the charge and what they were and then obviously people can treat them as they see appropriate. 
I think the important thing is that they relate effectively to boxes that have already been produced, so have been produced in the fiscal year ’06 or fiscal year ’07 area. From a GAAP point of view, it is clearly a charge and the important thing from my perspective is that people understand the magnitude of the charge and the major components of it in terms of what they -- what people can expect in the future will be a cash cost and what is simply an accounting charge against balance sheet items now. So people, depending on whether they are looking at cash flow as it sounds like you are or balance sheet or overall GAAP accounting, they’ve got hopefully all the major components to slice and dice the way they want to. 
John DiFucci - Bear Stearns

Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Holt with JP Morgan. 
Adam Holt - JP Morgan
Good afternoon. I have two questions about expenses and operating margins. You had relatively significant growth in headcount related expenses, both in the quarter as well as for the year. Could you talk a little bit about what we should expect for headcount growth as we look into next year? 
Secondly, if you look at the midpoint of the guidance for next year, you’re looking at maybe 60, 70 basis points of operating margin expansion year on year. How should we think about your strategy or your medium term margin expansion goals say over the next several years? Thanks. 
Chris Liddell
We’ll talk more extensively in terms of years other than next year at FAM, so if I can leave the longer term picture until then and then talk to last year and this year and hopefully that will give you some flavor. 
In terms of headcount growth, from my point of view, the good trend that we are seeing is a slowing of the headcount growth so I am certainly keen to see us grow from lower rates of headcount growth than we have seen in the last couple of years. We got down on a year-on-year basis in the last quarter to around 10%. Now that’s still relatively high but relative to our level of revenue growth. I’m much more comfortable with that than the mid-teen levels that we were seeing six to 12 months ago. 
Headcount growth is in a better shape than it has been from my perspective. In terms of next year, embedded inside the guidance, as you can imagine, is both headcount growth and cost per head at those more moderated levels. That is going to vary quite differently between the different divisions, though. 
For example, we are building headcount in our online business and headcount is relatively flat in our client business, so you are seeing quite different trends in where the heads are being added, adding up to the overall picture. 
It’s a little similar comment to the margin structure. From my perspective in terms of margins, I think of the business in three parts. There’s our core businesses of client, MBD and server and tools, and next year collectively you should expect their margins to be broadly equal to this year, which I think is a good result when you see what the growth rates are inherent in those businesses. 
You see EDD moving to profitability, so clearly that’s a margin improvement but obviously still being very much in the investment phase, so it will be in a loss position and hence a negative margin next year and some of the improvement that we are making in EDD effectively we are reinvesting in [OSD]. But net overall, as you say, midpoint of the guidance will be a slight improvement in margins next year and I’ll talk a little bit more next week about how I feel overall for margins longer term. 
Adam Holt - JP Morgan

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Maynard with Credit Suisse. 
Jason Maynard - Credit Suisse
Good afternoon. Chris, client and server and tools both came in a little bit lower than your guidance range. I was just curious if you would attribute that maybe to the stronger-than-expected strength in the EAs, or if you think some of the chatter around the timing of SP1 might have had an impact? Or any commentary on what virtualization is doing to the server market? 
Chris Liddell
Client was very much in line with our guidance. It might have been a shave off and to the extent that the Vista revenue recognition was a little lower than what we had indicated, but that was in the $20 million to $30 million category. Other than that, it was very much in line. 
Server and tools, you are correct, was a little light and was for the reasons that you mentioned, that we had a very strong annuity mix of revenue inside server and tools which helped us obviously from an un-earned perspective. That’s one of the reasons why our unearned was so strong and also one of the reasons consequently why we flowed that through the higher revenues the next year. 
But in the quarter, it hurts us in the sense that when we ship license only that we recognize all up front to annuity that we recognize over the length of the contract, we don’t get quite as much of a pop. That was the principal reason why server and tools was at the light end of what we guided. 
Jason Maynard - Credit Suisse
Maybe just a follow-up on that then; when you take into consideration your guidance around unearned for next year, are you assuming more normal historical type of EA mix rates or do you think it is going to continue on this path that you saw in Q4? 
Chris Liddell
I think it could well continue. I think that the really interesting trend underlying this and the strength of the product suite and offering that we have to customers and their desire and willingness to stay on enterprise agreements for all sorts of reasons. 
Firstly, obviously the product that we have; secondly, the ones that we have coming out; and people clearly focused on Vista and Office as the big products that we’ve launched but when you look at next year, which most people would not have thought was a big launch year and you think of new versions of Visual Studio, new versions of Window Server, new versions of SQL Server. You have Performance Point, our business intelligence coming out. CRM Live. There’s a lot of different products that are appealing from a customer point of view and staying on annuity also helps them from an administration and cost perspective. 
I think there’s lots of good reasons to think that we are seeing a potentially more sustainable trend on annuity mix, which hurts us a little bit in terms of up-front revenue recognition but in terms of the overall health of the business, is very positive from my perspective. 
Jason Maynard - Credit Suisse

Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch
Thank you very much, Chris and Colleen. Just an observation; I’m just looking to get your explanation behind this -- the rev rec positive change to the client business seems to have changed relative to your earlier guidance. In looking at the presentation, it says $540 million. The previous guidance was for $660 million of positive change in the rev rec. Does that mean that you've made any changes in your assumptions of Vista relative to XP in your mix for fiscal 2008 client guidance? 
As it relates to that, maybe if you could comment on, Chris, how are you seeing adoption of Vista in the enterprise? Because it occurs to me that I think you have given us a very neat explanation as to how you get to the client guidance. You have parsed out different elements. 
But the one piece that could be a swing factor is the business adoption seems like if we get better business adoption going into 2008, you might have a positive swing factor. I just was wondering if you had any comments on what kind of update we should expect that could cause the business premium mix to shift towards the positive. So it is really a two-part question there. Sorry about that. 
 Chris Liddell
 I'll cover both of them, if I can. In terms of the unearned, you're absolutely right. As we went from target seating, which we do around the March timeframe, the budgeting which we did last month, we fine-tuned the Vista/XP mix for next year. We changed it from 85% to 78%. Now it's a lower number, but it's still a very high number overall from our perspective, so 78% Vista mix in terms of sales next year. 
Because of that change, then the amount of undelivered element that comes from Vista is slightly lower than it would be otherwise. The underlying sales are still exactly the same, but that accounting impact, as you correctly say, decreases from $660 million to $540 million. 
So from our point of view, it's good that our outlook has pretty much exactly the same revenue overall, but the composition as a result of the accounting recognition is slightly different. 
In terms of the adoption from business, that is a slightly different parameter. Obviously, those two are linked to each other. It's early days here, We are seeing what we consider to be good customer response. But the next 12 to 18 months is really going to be the time when people are going to be looking seriously to roll it out. 
Looking out at the first stage we think it's early days, but it's good. Could there be some upside there if we see businesses adopt it? Not necessarily earlier, but have a refresh cycle which is a bit stronger than it is and hence we get a bit more business premium relative to customer premium? Yes. That's not so much a rollout then because we tend to get paid either way for XP or Vista, but it could help with the overall premium mix that I talked about a few minutes ago. 
 Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch 
 That's the fiscal 2008 forecast, right? 
 Chris Liddell
 Correct, yes. 
 Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch 
Okay, great. Thanks.

 Your final question comes from Kirk Materne - Banc of America. 
 Kirk Materne - Banc of America
This is a little bit of a follow-up on Kash's question. Chris, on the business premium mix can you give us an idea of what is in your forecast? It seems that your assumptions for the actual unit side of the business are pretty conservative in light of what you all have seen. Have you made any assumptions in terms of the premium mix getting better? I think it was down 3% this quarter. Is that forecasted to get a little better as we head into fiscal '08 or are you assuming it stays at the same rate? And if it does get better that is upside to what you are looking for? 
 Chris Liddell
 In terms of the overall premium mix, I'd say it's going to be in line with fiscal year 2007, which was 68% for the year. So plus or minus a percent here or there, I think it's going to be broadly in line next year with what it was this year. 
As we have with our forecasts, and clearly external ones may differ, in terms of the business and consumer mix we would see business premium being down slightly and consumer premium being up, so it's the same trend that we saw this year. That's entirely driven by the fact that we expect the consumer segment to grow faster than the business segment, so therefore by definition the percentage will increase in favor relative to the customers. 
That could change around a bit. We're relatively conservative, I think, on business growth overall, but I think it's appropriately conservative. We are seeing consumer sales consistently outpacing business sales for a number of years now, and I think that's the right starting place. 
Now obviously I would love to see some upside there, to the extent that we get a good price for business premium, but we have built in what I think is an appropriate mix going forward. 
Kirk Materne - Banc of America 
 Maybe just one follow-up on that. In terms of the business premium, is there any gating factors from say a technology or cost standpoint, meaning I think the enterprise edition comes along with Software Assurance. Is there anything structurally that's keeping people from going to a higher premium mix on the business side, or is it simply just an adoption issue? 
 Chris Liddell
 Well, you have two impacts. Consumers tend to buy consumer, and businesses tend to buy business SKUs. So you've got that mix impact. Inside businesses, there's nothing structurally which is stopping them from buying one particular SKU or another. You are right, the Software Assurance gets you the enterprises edition, which most large businesses would favor. But it's about the features; it's not about the technology that probably drives the decision as to which SKU to take. 
Kirk Materne - Banc of America 
Thanks very much.

Thanks, Colleen. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We're going to use our prepared remarks this afternoon to share our third quarter results, discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter, and provide a preliminary view of fiscal 2008. 
I'm extremely pleased with the company's financial performance during the quarter, as revenue, operating income and earnings per share exceeded our expectations and each grew at strong double-digit rates. Our results were primarily driven by strength in our core products. Windows Vista and 2007 Microsoft Office System will have a multi-year impact, and both are off to a very good start. 
Revenue growth in the third quarter was 32% and even if you were to exclude the $1.7 billion in recognition of previously deferred revenue associated predominately with our Technology Guarantee Programs for Windows and Office, our revenue growth would have been an extremely good 17%. Four of our five businesses delivered double-digit growth and we saw forward strength across all customer segments and channels. 
Excluding $0.01 in legal charges and a $0.02 tax benefit in the quarter, the revenue upside flowed through to operating income and earnings per share, which came in at $0.03 to $0.04 higher than our guidance in January. Cash flow from operations was also over $7 billion, indicative of the underlying strength of our business, and was a record for the company. 
Lastly, we continue to execute on our financial strategy. During the quarter we repurchased over $6.7 billion in company stock, and paid out just under $1 billion in dividends. This brings combined year-to-date repurchases and dividends to over $22.5 billion, which represents over 150% of our cash flow from operations over that same period. 
Moving now to the full fiscal year, we expect a strong finish to what has been an excellent year. We are increasing our revenue, operating income and earnings per share guidance for the year on the strength of our new product launches. Excluding certain legal charges and tax benefits in the prior and current years, we expect revenue growth in excess of 15% and earnings per share growth in excess of 16%. 
For both high level themes for the quarter and for the full year 2007, I'm going to turn the call over to Colleen for more details on our third quarter performance. 
Colleen Healy
Thanks, Chris. As Chris mentioned, the results for Q3 were excellent. Let me provide you with details on our financial performance, starting with revenue. I will discuss top line financial and business momentum points, and then follow-up with revenue performance for each of the business units. All growth comparisons I mention relate to the comparable quarter of last year, unless otherwise specified. 
Revenue for the quarter grew 32% to $14.4 billion, which includes $1.7 billion in recognition primarily from the Technology Guarantee Program. Excluding the recognition of these deferrals, revenue growth would have been 17%. Growth this quarter was driven by sales in our Client and Microsoft Business Division, following the general availability of Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office System in January. Server and Tools had another solid quarter. These three core businesses turned in notable performance, each growing at a double-digit rate, and collectively growing revenues 22%, or over $2 billion in absolute growth before the recognition of the Tech Guarantees. 
We saw continued strength in the underlying PC hardware market, which we estimate grew 10% to 12% during the quarter, a bit faster than we had expected. Growth in emerging markets continues to outpace that of mature markets, and the consumer PC shipment growth outpaced business shipments. Europe, Asia excluding Japan and Latin America maintained double-digit growth rates, while the remaining regions grew at single-digits. 
Our mix of product billings for the quarter was approximately 30% from OEMs, over 25% from multi-year licensing agreements, over 20% from license only sales, and the balance from our other businesses. The mix this quarter versus the same period in the prior year is higher in license only sales, primarily due to retail sales following the consumer launches of Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office System, and lower in our other businesses due to our core product making up a higher mix of revenue this quarter, as you would expect given where we are in our various product lifecycles. 
Our field sales force saw broad strength across our customer segments and regions. Our small, midmarket and retail sales group actively engaged with our customers and partners, readying the market for the product launches. The entertainment sales force drove robust volume license sales, and entertainment and enterprise agreements renewal rates at the high end of our historical range of 66% to 75%. We are delighted that the benefits and value proposition offered in the recent releases of our flagship products are resonating with customers. 
As a result of a strong annuity licensing results, our unearned revenue balance ended the quarter at $10.3 billion, up 16% over the same period in the prior year. Our contracted not billed balance at the end of March was sequentially higher and continues to exceed $9.5 billion. Taking into account reported revenue and changes in the unearned and contracted not billed balances, bookings growth totaled 20%, with bookings in our core business of Client, Microsoft Business Division and Server and Tools growing 25%. 
Before closing out the revenue overview, let me add that changes in foreign exchange rates added about 2 percentage points to our overall revenue growth rate in the quarter, and was generally in line with our expectations going into the quarter. 
Now I will provide revenue highlights by business segment. Client revenue of $5.3 billion, an increase of 67%, includes the recognition of $1.2 billion from Tech Guarantees and pre-shipments. Adjusting for this impact, Client revenue would have been $4.1 billion, up 30%, driven by growth in all channels due to the successful consumer launches of Windows Vista during the quarter. 
OEM revenue increased 24%, excluding the recognition of the Tech Guarantee deferrals, driven by 20% growth in OEM license units. The 8 to 10 point difference between OEM license unit growth and the overall PC market growth during the quarter is a result of a normal spike in license sales on the launch of a new operating system in our system builder channel, restocking of retail inventory levels by OEMs as a result of the consumer launch, and continued progress on unlicensed PCs under our existing program. 
Consistent with the results we saw last quarter and the relative strength in the Consumer segment following the launch, we continue to see a change within the mix of sales of our Premium Edition operating system. OEM Premium mix was 71%, an increase of 18 percentage points from the prior year, driven by sales of Windows Vista Home Premium, while our other business editions of Windows declined a few points in the overall mix. 
As we shared with you previously, Windows Vista business generates over five times the pricing of our Windows Vista Home Basic and of Windows Vista Home Premium. So the net result is that the increase in Premium mix added about 1 percentage point of growth to OEM revenue. 
Client, commercial and retail licensing grew 63%, excluding the recognition of pre-launch revenue deferrals, driven by strong sales to the retail channel following the consumer launch of Windows Vista and a very healthy commercial business. 
Server and Tools revenue of $2.7 billion grew 15%, primarily driven by double-digit growth in Windows Server, SQL Server and Visual Studio, as well as growth in our consulting and Premier services. Also, during the quarter we launched Systems Center Operations Manager 2007, which provides end-to-end management for the monitoring and reporting of Windows environments. 
In our Online Services business we saw continued improvement in our advertising platform monetization, which resulted in advertising revenue growth of 23%. Revenue for our Online Services business overall increased 11% to $6.2 million, driven by the growth in advertising revenue, partially offset by an expected decline in access revenue. Search revenue benefited from a higher number of search queries, and increased revenue per search on both a year on year and consequential basis. We are now monetizing more effectively in the U.S. on our own Ad Center platform than we had under third-party Overture at this time last year. Our display growth was in line with what is a healthy market, driven by an increase in page views. This quarter we forged content partnerships with Newscorp, NBC and CBS to enhance MSN's premium video inventory. 
Microsoft Business Division revenue of $4.8 billion grew 34%, or 20% after adjusting for the Tech Guarantee. Growth was driven by both consumer and business sales of the 2007 Microsoft Office system following the recent launches. The performance for the quarter was highlighted by a strong consumer response to the 2007 Microsoft Office system, which drove better than expected retail sales. We are also pleased with the results of our Dynamics business which showed healthy performance across both the ERP and CRM product lines, driving a 20% increase in customer billing. 
During the quarter we announced plans to acquire TellMe Networks, bringing this industry-leading expertise and voice services to our existing speech platform and unified communications offering. 
Consistent with our guidance, Entertainment and Devices revenue decreased 21% as a result of lower Xbox 360 sales. We sold over 5,000 Xbox 360 consoles during the quarter, bringing our life-to-date sell-in to approximately $11 million. Software and accessory attach rates remain at record levels in the U.S. per MPV, and we have passed the 6 million member mark for Xbox Live. 
Our Mobile and Embedded Devices business continued to turn in strong performance, with revenue growth in excess of 30%. During the quarter we unveiled Windows Mobile 6, the next version of our Windows Mobile software platform. We expect to see an increasing number of Windows Mobile 6 powered devices coming to market through the rest of this year. 
Now for the rest of the income statement. Cost of revenue increased 6%, primarily driven by data center costs, product costs associated with the launch of Windows Vista, and the growth in consulting services, partially offset by a decline in Xbox 360 console sales. Other operating expenses increased $928 million, or 20%, excluding legal charges of $154 million in the current quarter and $397 million in the same quarter from the prior year. This is favorable to our expectations, due primarily to shifting some marketing and product development costs into the fourth quarter. 
Operating income of $6.6 billion, or $5.1 billion after adjusting for the impact of the Tech Guarantee deferrals and legal charges, is up 18% from the prior year, driven by the 22% revenue growth in our core businesses of Client, Microsoft Business Division, and Server and Tools. 
Investment income and other totaled $382 million for the quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 29%, and was lower than expected due to a $195 million one-time tax benefit. Cash flow from operations increased 60% to $7.3 billion. During the quarter we repurchased 237 million shares, or $6.7 billion of company stock, and paid out $976 million in dividends to shareholders. Diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 9.9 billion, down 5% from the prior year as a result of execution against our share repurchase program. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.50, which includes the following non-recurring items: $0.12 related to the impact of the Tech Guarantees, a tax benefit of $0.02 offset by $0.01 in legal charges. 
So in summary, the third quarter broadly exceeded our expectations, driven by the extremely positive consumer response to the launches of our flagship products. 
With that, let me now turn it back to Chris, who will now provide you with our expectations for the fourth quarter and a preliminary outlook for fiscal year 2008. 
Chris Liddell
Thanks, Colleen. Let me now outline some key assumptions that we have used in putting together the outlook for the fourth quarter. Firstly, we estimate that PC unit growth for the quarter will be 10% to 12%. Within the overall PC market we expect current trends to continue, with a consumer segment growth exceeding that of the business segment, and emerging market growth exceeding that of mature markets. In contrast, third party analysts have lowered their full year server hardware growth estimate to 4% to 6% and although Server and Tools revenue is impacted by many additional factors, we have incorporated that into our guidance. Lastly, our guidance for the fourth quarter assumes that changes in foreign exchange rates will not have a significant impact on revenue growth rates for the quarter. 
So now for our detailed guidance. We expect fourth quarter revenue of $13.1 billion to $13.4 billion, growing 11% to 14%. Revenue guidance by business group is largely consistent with what we provided in January and so in the interested time I will simply provide you with the numbers. For Client we expect revenue growth of 14% to 15% for the fourth quarter. For Server and Tools, 16% to 17%. For Online Services, 10% to 15%, although excluding access subscription and transactions revenue, this implies advertising growth of 19% to 27%. For Microsoft Business Division, 13% to 14%. Finally, Entertainment and Devices revenue is expected to be down 2% to 11% in the fourth quarter. 
Now moving on to operating income. For the fourth quarter we expect to generate between $5.0 billion and $5.2 billion of operating income, representing 28% to 33% growth over the prior year. Well, 17% to 22% when legal charges of $351 million from the year-ago quarter are excluded. This was lower than the implied guidance from January due primarily to two factors. The first is a shift in operating expenses from the third quarter, as our full year total remains consistent with what we said in January. The second is higher COGS related to Xbox console and Windows Vista retail sales. 
We now estimate a fourth quarter effective tax rate of 31.5% due to a greater mix of forecasted earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions. For diluted earnings per share, we expect $0.37 to $0.39 for the fourth quarter. 
So with that fourth quarter guidance we arrive at the following expectations for the fiscal year. Revenue between $50.9 billion and $51.2 billion, representing growth of 15% to 16%. Operating income of $19.5 billion to $19.7 billion, or excluding certain legal charges, $19.7 billion to $19.9 billion, representing growth of 12% to 13% and for fully diluted earnings per share of $1.48 to $1.50 or adjusting for certain legal charges and tax benefits, $1.47 to $1.49, and representing growth of 16% to 17%. 
We are clearly pleased that our strong performance in Q3 has allowed us to raise our revenue, operating income and earnings per share estimates for the full year. From a balance sheet perspective, we expect unearned revenue to finish the year up 8% to 10%, an increase of 2 percentage points from our January guidance. This increase reflects our growing confidence in multi-year contract billings in Q4, where the revenue opportunity and undoubtedly risk, is the largest we have seen in two years. The deal pipeline is robust. The value proposition for multi-year contracts are strong and the product portfolio is broad and deep. 
With that, let's turn to our fiscal year '08 preliminary outlook. As is always the case at this time of year, we are providing you with our first look at the next fiscal year prior to finalizing our internal budgeting and planning process. Reflecting where we are in the planning cycle and consistent with our past practice, we're not currently in a position to give specific business group detail. I should also highlight that this guidance provides you with a view that balances both the risks and opportunities as we currently see them. 
For context, our expectations are based on a stable IT spending environment. 2007 IT spending has been generally healthy and although we may see softening in select areas such as server hardware growth, we're not expecting any significant changes on a regional basis in fiscal 2008. Also, we're not modeling any significant impact to year-over-year revenue growth from changes in foreign exchange rates. 
The continuous product innovation we have been stressing for two years is driving our expected growth and our product cycle continues in the next 12 months with the launches of, for example, Longhorn Server, the next version of our CRM software and live CRM service, Halo 3, the next version of Visual Studio, new Windows Live Search and Communication Services, Office Communications Server, Expressions Studio, Office Performance Point Server, Forefront Client Security, and many other products and services from across the company. 
We expect our product line ought to generate revenue of $56.5 billion to $57.5 billion in fiscal '08, representing growth of 11% to 12%. On an absolute basis, this translates into an increase of over $5.5 billion, an amount larger than the total annual revenue of some Fortune 500 companies. As we have previewed with you since October, this guidance reflects the requirements for Windows Vista revenue recognition, which results in a relatively faster revenue recognition as compared to Windows XP, where we have stood at 5% to 25% of license revenue. 
We are committed to transparency on this, so I would like to provide you with our revenue guidance adjusted for the impact of Windows Vista revenue recognition. We have included slide 20 in our earnings slide deck, which provide you with detail on the associated underlying balance sheet and P&L adjustments. 
Had we never deferred some delivered elements on Windows XP sales, our expected accounting revenue would be approximately $220 million lower in fiscal '07 and $660 million lower in fiscal '08. These figures represent the near annual amount of revenue we expect to recognize from the undelivered elements accounts on the balance sheet. From a year-over-year growth perspective, this impact represents approximately half a percentage point of consolidated corporate revenue growth in fiscal '07, and approximately 1 percentage point of consolidated corporate revenue growth in fiscal '08. 
Applied specifically to the Client business in fiscal '08, we expect a 3 percentage point impact in year-over-year Client revenue growth as a result of the Windows Vista revenue recognition methodology. Of course, the magnitude of revenue impact varies with the underlying sales mix between Windows Vista and Windows XP. Our fiscal '08 guidance numbers assume a unit mix of 85% Windows Vista, and 15% Windows XP. The amount of impact we have highlighted today could differ materially to the extent that transition to Windows Vista from Windows XP differs from our forecast. In other words, the faster the transition to Windows Vista, the bigger and more positive the impact will be in fiscal '08. 
While on the subject of Client revenue, we recognize there's a lot of interest in our outlook for fiscal '08. Although we won't be providing specific Client business guidance on the call today, I would like to briefly provide you with some directional expectations. For your convenience, we have laid these out for you on slide 21 of our earnings slide deck. 
The starting point for any analysis in our Client business should begin with PC sales in mature markets, which we expect to grow in mid single-digit range. We expect to get a modest uplift from emerging markets, where the underlying market growth is higher and we have the opportunity to reduce piracy. Offsetting this uplift is the successful launch of Windows Vista in 2007, which creates a difficult retail comp in fiscal '08. Adding these together, our expectation is that Client organic revenue growth in fiscal '08 will be in line with, or slightly better than, the mid single-digit growth rate for PC sales in mature markets and that Client’s GAAP revenue growth will be 3 percentage points higher than the organic growth rate, due to Windows Vista revenue recognition methodology. We will provide our specific Client revenue guidance for fiscal '08 in July, but I hope this provide you with some insight into how we're thinking about our forecast, and assist you with your modeling. 
Now moving on to operating income. Operating income is expected to be between $22.0 billion and $22.5 billion. Excluding certain legal charges in fiscal '07, operating income growth of 12% to 14% is slightly faster than revenue growth. This guidance implies incremental year-over-year COGS plus OpEx spending of between $3.3 billion and $3.6 billion, when you exclude legal charges in fiscal '07. Of these amounts, somewhat less than $2.7 billion is operating expenses, which is consistent with our commentary at the February analyst meeting in New York. 
I would like to take time here to provide you with some of the key drivers behind our COGS and OpEx spending in fiscal '08. First, let's cover COGS. Incremental COGS spending will be in excess of $600 million, driven primarily by two factors. One, higher network infrastructure costs and delivering online services such as Windows Live, Office Live, CRM Live and Xbox Live. Two, increased scale of our consultant services business. Higher overall revenues and greater unit sales of Zune and Xbox 360 will have some impact as well. 
In terms of incremental operating expenses, I would like to describe the underlying drivers using the same four categories we used for fiscal '07. The largest category remains our broad array of investments in high growth areas. As we continue to stress, innovation drives long-term growth, and we intend to continue to invest in the best opportunities. This makes up over one-third of the incremental OpEx in fiscal '08. 
The second largest category is our investment in services, which makes up about a quarter of the incremental OpEx in the business. The online services area is also critical to our future success, and we have built up an appropriate level of potential future investment that reflects our current thinking. 
The third category is marketing and field sales costs, which makes up about 25% of the total. The remainder of the incremental operating expenses are driven by general increases in costs, as well as unallocated spending related to small acquisitions that we may do during the year. 
Now for the rest of the income statement. We expect investment income to be lower in fiscal '08 due to lower cash balances resulting from our stock repurchases in fiscal '07. We're also modeling a 30.5% tax rate in fiscal '08, driven by a higher mix of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions. Our forecast for fully diluted earnings per share is therefore $1.58 to $1.72, representing growth of 14% to 15%, excluding legal charges and tax benefits in fiscal '07. Similar to fiscal '07, we expect to grow earnings this year at a rate faster than revenue and operating income. 
As always, I will remind you that as you think about the guidance we have provided that you also consider the risks. Those risks include competitive, legal, execution and general market risks, as well as PC and Turbo hardware growth rates and customer acceptance of our product. Also, our emerging businesses are harder to forecast when compared to our mature businesses and as they become a larger part of the overall financial mix, they may contribute to increased volatility in our performance. 
I would like to wrap up today with two final and brief observations. The first is that if we take a step back and look at the results we have delivered, as well as the guidance provided for fiscal '08, you find that we're growing revenue, profits and earnings per share at impressive rates on both an absolute and relative basis for a company our size. For example, excluding legal charges and tax benefits, our fiscal '08 guidance implies earnings per share growth of $0.41 to $0.45, or 32% to 35% over two years. 
The second observation is that I believe the third quarter results and the guidance we have provided are indicative of how we build long-term shareholder value in the company. We do so by driving robust revenue growth for our established cores in the desktop and server markets, as well as by building new cores in online services and entertainment. By translating that revenue growth into strong operating profits and cash flow, allows us the flexibility to make significant investments to drive future growth, and finally by returning capital to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. 
We believe this is an optimal model for delivering long-term shareholder value and I'm pleased that our third quarter and our forward-looking outlook reflect our execution against this. 
Thank you for your time today and I will now hand the call over to Colleen so we can take your questions. 
 Colleen Healy
Let’s now proceed to questions. We want to accommodate questions from as many people as possible, so please avoid multi part questions and limit yourselves to just one question. Operator, will you please repeat your instructions? 
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Heather Bellini - UBS. 
 Heather Bellini – UBS
Thanks Rick and Colleen. I actually had a question about the premium mix that you reported. It seems to be coming in much better than what you guys had forecasted prior to Vista launching. I just wanted to get your sense for how you think this is going to track over time, and should we hold constant this type of Vista Premium mix adoption? 
In terms of the 85/15 mix that you're forecasting between Vista and XP, how would that have compared to your expectations of what actually happened when XP launched? Thank you. 
Chris Liddell
In terms of the Premium mix, you're right, it is coming in above our expectations and are good. Within that obviously you do have a shift between Pro and what was previously Media standard. There's a mix shift within the mix. We think that we are going to see in fiscal year '08 a continuation of the trend that we saw in fiscal year '07 so the numbers from a Premium point of view will be broadly the same. 
What we're thinking of doing probably for next year is to start to give you some more visibility into how that Premium mix is made up, because, as we have talked about on previous calls, this is quite a different economic impact, depending on in this case whether it is Vista Premium or Vista Business, one being five times the economic benefit relative to the other. So we'll continue to give you the Premium mix as we see, which you can think of as being broadly equal to fiscal year '07 a lot of the benefit that we are seeing. But will also start to give you some visibility into the split of that Premium mix going forward as well. 
What was the second half of your question? 
 Heather Bellini – UBS
You commented about a 85% Windows Vista mix, 15% XP. What did you see during the last cycle when XP launched, what was the mix? 
Colleen Healy
It is not going to be terribly comparable just because of also the SKUs structure. 
Chris Liddell
But generally speaking it is faster. So 85/15 is very healthy. Now it obviously may vary on that, it is going to depend on the consumer versus the business. 
 Heather Bellini – UBS
Are you forecasting faster adoption of Vista than what you saw for adoption of XP, is the question? 
Chris Liddell
We don't think of it that way. We don't do a comparison back to that. But if you look at the math of it, that is likely to be the result. What we are looking at is the underlying trends we see in the business relative to Vista, regardless of what might have happened four years ago. As we see the mix in consumer versus business, and as we see the overall growth rates and as we see the current adoption, we think 85% is a reasonable starting point for next year. 
Colleen Healy
You know, obviously, the variable there that people look to is on the business side and how quickly they're adopting. We feel like because this version, as you'll remember when was in beta was very widely tested, we feel like the tools and costs associated with it and ease of images, we are optimistic but we still don't want to get ahead of ourselves. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Charlie DiBona - Sanford Bernstein. 
Charlie DiBona - Sanford Bernstein
Chris, you spent a lot of time clarifying client guidance and accounting, but I'm wondering if I could maybe change gears for a second and look at my favorite group, the Online Services group? It seems like from your financial results this quarter and from some of the external metrics that you maybe stopped some of the deterioration there. Certainly any metrics more that you want to share there would be appreciated. 
Going forward, now that you have sort of stabilized the patient, can you maybe talk strategically about how you want to get him up off the table and move in the right direction? Maybe also how you're going to build share and community and how OSG relates in that process to the other business groups, both in building its business and then feeding back into those ones? 
Chris Liddell
Lots to digest in that one. But let me cover the ground, and then get back on any particular aspect. You're absolutely right. From a quarterly point of view this was a much better quarter for OSB. If you exclude the Access and Subscription business, the advertising revenue, which is probably the single best metric to look at in terms of growth year on year, was up 23%. If you look at the guidance that we're talking about for next quarter, we're looking at greater than 20% again in the fourth quarter as well. 
That is a reflection of a number of factors. One is display growth revenue growing broadly in line with market. The second is the benefits now of Ad Center are coming on stream. So we have talked with you about this a lot. We said that we would lap our previous monetization rate on Ad Center at some stage in this fiscal year. Well, we did that in that third quarter. So we're a little ahead of ourselves. We were expecting more like fourth quarter, but we did it in the third quarter. So we are ahead of where we were on the Overture platform of a year ago now and obviously on an appreciating trend. When you look at the number of advertisers that we are getting on the platform, we're getting at or above the rates that we were expecting and with considerably less advertisers than on the Overture platform, we're getting a higher monetization. 
So we are feeling very good about the rates that we are seeing in terms of Ad Center overall. That is feeding through to the revenue growth numbers that you see, if you exclude the Access. Again, we will try quarter by quarter to give you that advertising number to give you a sense of the health of the underlying business. 
To your broader question about strategy, from our point of view it is a continuation of what we have talked about, which is we are going to invest in this business because we see it as a long-term one. We like a lot of the growth that we are getting on the display side. We are happy with it. On the communication side, you have the growth in Hotmail and Messenger accounts, which we don't currently monetize to any great extent, but it still is extremely healthy and we're very happy with, for example, some of the relevancy in the underlying product in our search. We aren't happy, clearly, with the market share we have. 
So some things we are happy with, some things that we're not happy with, or I would like to see a lot better but we are going to continue to invest. We're going to continue to invest in the infrastructure of the business, we will continue to invest in new products, we will continue to invest in the search relevancy side of things. And in terms of the infrastructure, that will support not only the online business, but it will support Office Live. It will support Xbox Live. That is another healthy statistic from our point of view, with greater than 6 million customers now on Xbox Live. So that is a very good platform. The platform will support that area. 
In terms of accounting, to a large extent we bear the costs inside the Online Services area without trying to change accounting around. We may try and give you more visibility into how it helps some of the other businesses, but certainly strategically it helps them quite a lot. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Adam Holt - JP Morgan. 
 Adam Holt - JP Morgan 
My question is about the underlying strength in the Office business or the MBD category. If you strip out the one-time events in the quarter, it looks like you still had about 20% growth in MBD. I guess what I'm trying to understand is what was the mix between what came off the balance sheet relative to what was new business? And understanding there's a little bit of retail spike here, how should we think about the Enterprise business feathering in over the next couple of quarters, particularly in the context of how you compare that to Vista? 
Chris Liddell
I think it is great. We tend to get 90% of our questions about Client, and to a large extent the MBD business is a real success story in the third quarter. We exceeded our revenue expectations by around $200 million and that was on the back of, to a large extent, just very good retail sales, so sales of units out the door. We feel like that is a direct customer acceptance of a very good product. 
It didn't result from any balance sheet movements. In fact, we are slightly penalized because of the change in revenue recognition inside that division but to a large extent, very good customer acceptance, very good retail sales inside the quarter. 
In terms of annuities going forward, which is probably more of the case; obviously we're not going to at this date give you fiscal year '08 numbers, but for the fourth quarter a continuation of very good revenue growth numbers inside that division. Embedded inside fiscal year '08 we think the business will continue to do well. 
I am happy, very happy with the retail acceptance of the product. From an annuity point of view and a business point of view at this stage it is early days, but it is good as well. 
Colleen Healy
Just in terms of that housekeeping matter, we had about $0.5 billion of Tech Guarantee. Your 20% year on year is the normalized growth, and we think it speaks to the strength of the business and the launch in the quarter. 
Chris Liddell
But to be clear, 20% is excluding the Tech Guarantee impact. 
 Adam Holt - JP Morgan 
If I could just ask a follow-up on that, if you were to look at this business adding into the next quarter with respect to the small business segment of it, are you seeing small businesses gravitate towards long-term contracts, or do you think the small business activity is going to be principally more like licensing and more like the consumer? 
Chris Liddell
We aren't seeing any marked difference in the pick up to any great extent. The same split that we have seen in terms of 40% annuity, 40% license only is, broadly speaking, what we are expecting going forward. 
Colleen Healy
Just to add to that, the metrics, certainly the 20% billings growth does speak to the Dynamics business, which targets more of that segment that you're talking about. And then on the CRM side, we did announce in March reaching that milestone of 10,000 customers and 400,000 users. We're continuing to work the value proposition there. 
Operator
Your next question comes from John DiFucci - Bear Stearns. 
 John DiFucci - Bear Stearns 
Chris, you told us what the impact of the Technology Guaranteed Program was on the Client business, but you also mentioned a couple of other events that are different this quarter versus previous quarters. There was a revenue recognition change and also the channel preparation for the launch. Can you tell us what the growth would have been if you excluded both of those? 
Along the same lines, just to follow, on the revenue rec change, the numbers you threw out there seemed a little low to me, looking at the rest of this year and next. Are you going to give us what the impact has been on a quarterly basis? 
Chris Liddell
We will certainly give you the Vista revenue recognition impact on a quarter-by-quarter basis. That is what we can do right at the start. We are very happy to do it. If you look at the chart that I referred to, I'm not sure you had a chance to as I was speaking, it gives you it in black and white. It is $220 million in fiscal year '07 and $660 million in fiscal year '08. 
Of that $220 million in fiscal year '07, it was broadly equal in Q3 and Q4. That would have had about 0.5% impact from a growth rate point of view. That is just for the Vista revenue recognition impact. For the company overall and for Client it was around 3%. We are certainly happy to work through the math. I know there's a lot of moving parts, but we will give you total transparency to the extent we can. 
 John DiFucci - Bear Stearns 
Even though in Q3 there was only two months out of the three that really had the impact, you think it will be evenly split? If you included that impact, plus the channel preparation for the launches, I think either you or Colleen mentioned generally usually you see a spike in the revenue due to that. During a launch quarter what would the Client growth have been? 
Chris Liddell
 If I work through the math, if you start with PC unit growth in the quarter, it was around 10% to 12%. We saw OEM unit growth of 20%. So the units grew in excess of PC units and that is people stocking obviously or restocking, and some of the system builder channel impacts as well, so unit growth of around 20%. If you exclude the Vista and the Tech Guarantee, the OEM revenue grew broadly in line to 21% relative to 20% growth. 
The commercial and retail, which was obviously the retail spike, grew 53% and Client revenue overall would have grown 27%. So if you exclude all the accounting impacts, that is probably the easiest way to work through it. But it is still a very healthy quarter, up 27%. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Sara Friar - Goldman Sachs. 
 Sara Friar - Goldman Sachs
 Maybe you could switch to just the Entertainment and Devices division. Could you just give us some clarity, Chris, on whether you are still expecting profitability for that division in FY’08? Obviously that has been a big milestone. 
I think last quarter it seemed as if you were managing that inventory, but I assumed that was somewhat ahead of a price cut, so any further color you could give us there would be great. And then just one more on the Halo 3 launch. What are you expecting in terms of impact from Halo 3, and just overall attach rates as the cycle gets a little bit more mature? 
 Chris Liddell
The sales during the quarter in terms of sell-in were around 500,000 consoles. The sell-through, that is what the retailers sells, was higher than that, so our inventory levels did come down to more around normal levels we would expect. We did a good inventory movement during the course of the quarter. 
In terms of profitability for next year, that is certainly the target. We're working through our budgeting process now, but from my point of view anyway, that is the starting point going into next year. Obviously, there's a lot of moving parts there in terms of our ability to take COGS of the system, how many units we sell and factors like that. But that is certainly the starting point. 
In terms of Halo 3, that is clearly going to have a positive impact in two senses. One, it gives us more confidence with the number of consoles that we think we are going to be able to sell next year. In terms of a direct impact, obviously it is a third-party product, so it is reasonably profitable from our point of view. It will be several hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue next year. 
 Sara Friar - Goldman Sachs
 Terrific. No change competitively this quarter in terms of Sony and Wii and so on? 
 Chris Liddell
 I'm sorry, what was that? 
 Sara Friar - Goldman Sachs
 Any changes competitively from the other two big game vendors, Sony and Nintendo? 
 Chris Liddell
 No, nothing of significance. We are obviously very happy from a competitive point of view with the response in the marketplace, but nothing of significance. 
Operator
 Your next question comes from Kirk Materne - Banc of America Securities. 
 Kirk Materne - Banc of America Securities
 Chris, you mentioned going into your fourth quarter you have a number of large multi-year deals up for renewal. Can you just give us some color perhaps around how many of those deals involves say upselling a large enterprise from the Business version to get them on the Enterprise version, which would also take them into a longer-term agreement with you guys around software assurance? 
I'm just trying to get a sense on how many of those type of deals are still out there where a customer might be on software assurance for Office but not for Vista, for example. Any color around that would be helpful. 
 Chris Liddell
 I can't give you a proportion, but I think if I talk about it the way the field thinks about it, every license that comes up for renewal is an opportunity to sell additional products. When you think about it, it is a three-year anniversary, generally speaking. So in the last three years if you think about the products we have launched, it is not just the obvious ones of Vista and Office. There's a significant amount of additional products that the field now has the ability to sell as part of an enterprise agreement. So there is a significant number of contracts coming up and clearly, there is some risk to the extent those people now have an entitlement to Vista and Office, but there is an opportunity because of all the other products. 
I don't want to say there is an X percent where we think we will be successful but we certainly feel good about maintaining the renewal rate of two-thirds to three-quarters, and in some instances they would be additional products as well. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch. 
 Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch
 I just want to clarify on the EPS guidance for fiscal '08, that does include the positive impact from the rev rec rate, so how would you quantify that if you look at the $1.68 to $1.72, does $0.04 to $0.05 positive impact from the rev rec seem like a reasonable assumption? 
 Chris Liddell
 We give the specific number, so depending on how you treat it. But if we look at the GAAP unearned income that comes off our balance sheet and we expect to flow through the income statement next year, it is $660 million. So that will equate to around $0.04 a share, if you take an after-tax and divide it by our number of shares. So that number may go up or down slightly depending on our actual sales and the mix of Vista and XP. But if you just take our guidance as it sits, it would be around $0.04 a share. 
 Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch
 What is the confidence level at this early point in the cycle, Chris, with 85% Vista, 15% XP assumption? What we hear from our surveys is that a lot of the Enterprises seem to want to do an implementation of Vista in 2008. So how are you thinking about the confidence level in the 85/15 mix between Vista and XP? 
 Chris Liddell
 It is early days, so the standard deviation is quite high. But I will just say that our fiscal year '08 picks up the first six months of calendar year 2008. So to the extent that some people are on the sidelines waiting, they may well be looking at a position of early next year and that would pick up our fiscal year. 
It could be a relatively high swing between 85/15. From a revenue recognition point of view that might move around from an accounting perspective. From a cash flow point of view, it is not really going to have a significant impact. 
 Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch
 Finally, the units on Vista you disclosed, I think one month after the launch, was 20 million. Any update on that during the quarter how many units of Vista? If you could break that out between OEM and retail, that would be useful. 
 Chris Liddell
 No, I don't have a number to give you today. I'm happy to talk to the Client people, and if there's a number they would like to give out, we will follow-up with that. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Brent Thill - Citigroup. 
 Brent Thill – Citigroup
Thanks, good afternoon. Chris, next year for fiscal '08 on operating margins, I believe that implies roughly flat with '07. Can you help us reconcile, considering that you're headed in probably the strongest point of your product cycle in a number of years, how you expect that operating margin to play out with regard to what your long-term model looks like and where you were at a couple of years ago at much higher operating margins? 
 Chris Liddell
Sure. I will start with just the guidance we have given you, at least on a GAAP basis. So we talk about revenue growth of 11% to 12%, and operating income growth of 12% to 14%. So you see a slight margin expansion based on that, although some of that is obviously the Vista accounting impact, and obviously earnings per share growing at 14% to 15%, so higher again; so a little bit improved margins in that respect. 
When I look at next year, we are still in investment mode in Online Services. We are looking at year-on-year growth on expenses broadly in line with what we have talked about. We're talking about growing the company's revenue base 11% to 12%. So if we can get margin expansion, I think that is tremendous. I think you have to look at the underlying businesses and look at them one by one. But if we can grow the company top line 11% to 12% and maintain or possibly slightly enhance our margin structure, I think that is a good starting base for a company of our size. 
 Brent Thill – Citigroup
 I would just be curious to get your thoughts. A number of the hardware companies have mentioned a sluggish March. It appears that you're not seeing that. Maybe offer some thoughts in terms of what the difference is there. As a follow-up on the business segment, you mentioned the consumer segment is tracking ahead of the business. When do you expect the business segment to really start to kick in? 
 Chris Liddell
 Obviously we have a lot of different cycles from a hardware manufacturer, given the number of businesses that we're in. You have to look at it across the whole suite of our businesses. The thing that I would say is we are not seeing any significant slowdown in aggregate across our businesses. Individual businesses may have some, but certainly for the company overall, given the multiplicity of businesses we're involved in, we are seeing healthy demand. 
We have a good international business as well, which helps as well. I assume your question was mainly around North America, but a large number of our sales are outside North America and the economies are doing very well there and we're certainly seeing growth rates that are very good there as well. So no particular aspects there. 
What was the second part of your question? 
 Brent Thill – Citigroup
 Just in terms of when do you think the business segment starts to maybe eclipse the consumer segment, when you see that strength kicking in? 
 Chris Liddell
 I think the business segment is probably going to continue to be broadly equal to what it is at the moment. So it is really around consumer growth and whether that changes or not. But if the business growth continues in the sort of mid single-digits, the consumer growth is probably growing in excess of 10%. I don't necessarily see that inverting for the foreseeable future. I think customer growth would have to slide down quite a lot in order to dip below business growth, which I think is going to remain relatively healthy.

Thanks, Colleen and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to be with you today to share our second quarter results and discuss our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2007. Looking back over the second quarter, I would characterize it as a very good close to the first half of the year, and it continues our progress for an excellent year overall. All aspects of our financial performance came in at or above the high end of our guidance. We were happy to see the PC hardware market strength in the quarter. And, by launching our flagship products to business customers at the end of November, we passed the last significant milestone towards forward availability. 
Looking at our second quarter financial performance, revenue grew 6%. If you were to exclude the $1.6 billion revenue deferral associated predominately with our technology guarantee program for Windows and Office, our revenue growth would have been 20%. That is impressive growth for any company, let alone one of our size. 
Business customer demand for our server and tools and Microsoft business division products was healthy across major geographies in both our large and small customer segments. Looking specifically at sales in December, we saw encouraging signs of early demand for the 2007 Microsoft Office system, Exchange Server 2007 and Windows Vista. 
Retail demand during the holiday quarter was robust for consumer PCs as well as for Xbox 360 consoles and games, helping to push revenue for both client and entertainment and devices to the upper end of our quarterly guidance. 
Operating income benefited from both the strong revenue as well as lower spending, primarily on marketing programs, most of which shifted out of quarter 2 and into the rest of the year. The operating income results flowed through the P&L and drove EPS numbers that came in $0.02 to $0.04 above what we told you in October. 
Moving to the full fiscal year, 2007 continues to deliver excellent financial performance. Next week, we celebrate the consumer launches of Windows Vista and the 2007 Office system. Our product groups will have put in significant work to deliver what are truly compelling products, and now our customers can benefit from those efforts. 
Let me make two key points about fiscal 2007. First, I'm very pleased that we continue to expect full year double-digit revenue growth. Overall, this is in line with what we told you last quarter, although we are making some adjustments to the mix of revenue. 
Second, excluding legal charges and tax benefits in the prior year, we expect earnings per share will also grow double-digits and faster than revenue. This growth is even after we launch the major products and continue to invest in future growth opportunities in all our divisions. With those high level themes for the quarter and for the full year of 2007, I'm going to the turn the call over to Colleen now for more details on our second quarter performance. 
Colleen Healy
 Thanks, Chris. As Chris mentioned, Q2 was a strong quarter overall, contributing to a good first half of the fiscal year. During the quarter revenue, operating income and EPS exceeded the high end of our guidance and we continued executing on our product cycle, with the business launch of Windows Vista, the 2007 Microsoft Office system and Exchange Server 2007. 
Let me provide you with details on our financial performance, starting with revenue. I will discuss top line financial and business momentum points and then follow up with revenue performance for each of the business units. All growth comparisons I mention relate to the comparable quarter of last year, unless otherwise specified. 
Revenue for the quarter was $12.5 billion, up 6%. Growth for the quarter was impacted by $1.6 billion in revenue deferrals out of Q2 that will be recognized in Q3, primarily related to the Windows and Office Technology Guarantee Program. The deferral amount is up slightly from the $1.5 billion that we previously guided, driven by strength in the PC market. Adjusting for these revenue deferrals, revenue growth would have been 20%. Revenue growth for the quarter was driven by a 76% increase in entertainment and devices and robust growth in our core businesses of client, server and tools, and the Microsoft business division, which grew a combined 11% after adjusting for the deferrals, primarily from the tech guarantees. 
Healthy growth in the hardware market was a key contributor to the results for the quarter. We estimate the PC market grew faster than we expected at 8% to 10% during the quarter. This growth is particularly strong, considering the upcoming consumer launch of Windows Vista, illustrating the success of our Tech Guarantee Program, as well as the continuing value proposition of Windows XP. 
Consumer PC shipment growth once again outpaced business shipments, driven by a strong holiday sales season. From a form factor perspective, growth in notebook PC shipments continues to outpace that of desktops. PC unit growth continues to be led by the emerging markets. Asia, excluding Japan, and Latin America maintained double-digit growth rates, while the remaining regions grew at single digits. Server hardware shipment growth remained consistent with our full year estimate of 10% to 12%. 
Our mix of products billings was approximately 30% from OEM, 25% from multi-year licensing agreements, 20% from license-only sales, and the balance from our other businesses. Relative to prior year, our billing mix continues to shift to our other businesses, driven by the increasing revenue from our entertainment and devices divisions. 
We had a very strong quarter overall from a volume licensing perspective, with broad-based strength across our customer segments and regions, which drove growth in enterprise agreements, as well as select and open annuity licenses. We estimate that EA renewal rates were at the high end of our historical range of 56% to 75%. In addition, select and open license-only growth accelerated in December after the business launches of Windows Vista, the 2007 Office system and Exchange Server 2007. 
Our unearned revenue balance ended the quarter a bit higher than we expected at $11.9 billion, including the $1.7 billion of deferrals primarily related to the technology guarantees. Excluding this impact, the unearned balance would have grown 15% over the prior year and still have been up sequentially. Our contracted, non-billed balance at the end of December was also sequentially higher and now exceeds $9.5 billion. If you consider our reported revenue and changes in the unearned and contracted, non-billed balances, our bookings growth exceeded 20% for the quarter. 
Before I get into the revenue details for each business group, let me point out that changes in foreign exchange rates added about 1 point to our overall revenue growth rate. Client revenue of $2.6 billion, a decline of 25%, includes the impact of $1.1 billion of revenue deferrals, primarily related to the tech guarantee. Adjusting for this impact, Client revenue would have been $3.7 billion, up 9%, driven by growth in the OEM business. OEM revenue increased 8%, excluding the tech guarantee, due to 10% growth in OEM license units. OEM revenue grew at a slightly slower pace than license units, due to the continued increased volume in emerging markets and the shift in channel mix towards larger OEMs, partially offset by the impact from the increase in premium mix. 
OEM premium mix increased 18 percentage points from the prior year to 67%. Consistent with the relative strength in the consumer segment, especially during holiday, and deferred by the technology guarantee program, we saw a shift within the premium mix itself. Specifically, the growth in the premium mix was a result of consumers purchasing Windows XP Media Center, driven by the upgrade pricing structure offered under the technology guarantee program. So while Windows XP Professional grew year on year, its portion of the premium mix declined a couple of percentage points. While we are delighted to see the increasing trend of consumers recognizing the value offered in premium Windows, we want to point out to you that in the U.S., Windows XP Professional generates over five times the pricing uplift over Windows XP Home than does Windows XP Media Center. 
Client commercial and retail licensing grew 13%, primarily from sales of Windows Vista into the retail channel, and our partners began readying for Windows Vista general availability. Our commercial business remained healthy, fueled by growth in multi-year contract agreements. The client business made significant progress on the product front this quarter with the business launch of Windows Vista, the most significant operating system release since Windows 95. 
Server and tools delivered double-digit revenue growth for the 18th consecutive quarter. Its 17% revenue growth was driven by broad adoption of our server and tools product line, particularly SQL Server, which had another quarter of over 30% revenue growth. 
Revenue for our online services business grew 5% to $624 million, driven by an increase in advertising revenue of 20%, partially offset by an expected decline in access revenue. Healthy growth in display, coupled with a modest increase in search, drove the rise in the total advertising revenue. Increasing search queries contributed to search revenue growth on a year-over-year basis for the first time since we began our transition to AdCenter in the U.S. last year. 
Microsoft business division revenue was $3.5 billion, or $4 billion after adjusting for the $500 million tech guarantee and preshipment deferral. Growth was driven by the strength of our annuity business and earlier than expected uptake in our license-only business following the business launches of the 2007 Office system and Exchange Server 2007. The Dynamics business continued its strong performance in Q2, as demonstrated by a 19% increase in customer billings. 
Lastly, entertainment and devices growth of 76% for the quarter was driven by Xbox 360 sales. We have now sold 10.4 million consoles life to date. And according to NTB, consumers in the U.S. purchased more Xbox 360s than both the Wii and PlayStation 3 combined during the month of December. Software attach rates remain at record levels in the U.S., bolstered by the broad success of Gears of War, which sold over 2.7 million copies in its first eight weeks in market. 
Our mobile and embedded device business also performed well, selling over 3 million licenses for Windows mobile phone-enabled devices, up over 90% year over year. During the quarter, we launched the Zune digital media player in the United States, which furthers our strategy of connected entertainment. 
Now for the rest of the income statement: positive revenue increase 62%, due primarily to an increase in Xbox 360 sales. As a result, gross margin relative to the prior year was down about 10 percentage points, a slightly larger drop than the guidance we provided in October. This was primarily driven by stronger than expected sales of Xbox 360, as well as an extension of the Xbox 360 warranty from 90 days to one year in the U.S. and Canada. 
Q2 operating expenses other than cost of revenue increased $509 million or 10%. This was a little higher than expected, due to the timing of certain spending, particularly for sales and marketing programs. 
Operating income was $3.5 billion. Adjusting for the tech guarantee deferrals, operating income would have been $5.1 billion, up 10% from the prior year, driven by strength in our core businesses. 
Investment income and other totaled $333 million. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 31%, up from 29% last year. This year over year rate increase was impacted by a $108 million tax benefit in the prior year. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 205 million shares or $6 billion worth of our stock and paid $980 million in dividends to shareholders. Diluted shares outstanding were 9.9 billion, down 7% from the prior year, as a result of execution on our share repurchase program. Our diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were impacted by the issuance of 113 million shares in December related to options exercised by JP Morgan for the employee stock option transfer program completed in December 2003. This settlement marks the final expiration of all remaining options under its program. 
Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.26, which includes approximately an $0.11 per share deferral, primarily from tech guarantees. 
So in summary, Q2 delivered strong results across the board. Revenue results for all of the segments met or exceeded the top end of our guidance and translated to out performance for both operating income and EPS. Additionally, the quarter marked the business launch of our flagship products. 
With that, let me turn it back to Chris, who will provide you with our expectations for Q3 and the remainder of fiscal 2007. 
 Chris Liddell
Thanks, Colleen. Before we get into the specific guidance, let me outline some of our key assumptions. Our fiscal 2007 forecast assumes no major changes in the economic conditions from where we exited the first half, and we're not forecasting any significant impacts from foreign exchange rate movements. 
We expect PC unit growth to be 8% to 10% for the fiscal year, in line with the guidance we gave you last quarter, and between 9% to 11% for the third quarter. We continue to estimate the PC unit growth rates will be higher in the consumer segment than in the business segment, and higher in the emerging markets than in mature markets. On the server hardware front, we remain comfortable with our estimate for total market price of 10% to 12% for the year. 
Now let me get into our detailed guidance. For the full year, we expect our revenues to come in at $50.2 billion to $50.7 billion, growing 13% to 14%. We are narrowing our revenue range to reflect how we finished the second quarter, as well as to incorporate changes to the mix of revenue. Our growth is driven by broad-based revenue growth across our five segments, with each of our core businesses growing double-digits. 
For the third quarter, we expect revenue of $13.7 billion to $14.0 billion, which represents growth of 26% to 28% year over year. Our third quarter will benefit from recognition of the $1.7 billion of revenue that we deferred out of the first half, $45 million from Q1 and $1.64 billion from Q2, primarily associated with our technology guarantee program. Before these impacts, third quarter revenue guidance would have been $12 billion to $12.3 billion, which would have represented growth of 10% to 13%. There's clearly no impact to the full year, as we have discussed. 
With that, revenue guidance in our five business units is as follows: 
For client, we have increased our full year growth forecast to 11% to 12%, up from the 9% to 10% we gave you in October and this has been driven by a higher premium mix in our OEMs revenue and a faster transition to Windows Vista. We expect third quarter growth to be 54% to 56%, although our third quarter guidance includes the recognition of approximately $1.2 billion in revenue primarily associated with our tech guarantee program. Before that deferral, third quarter revenue would be growing 16% to 18%. 
Growth accelerates in the second half of the year for the commercial and retail portion of the client segment, beginning in quarter 3, driven by broad availability of Windows Vista. Client OEM revenue should grow roughly in line with the PC hardware market for the year. We are increasing our expectation for premium mix in the second half of the year and we now expect our full-year premium mix to be about 60%. The increase is driven by mix assumptions for our consumer premium products such as Windows XP Media Center and Windows Vista Home Premium. As Colleen mentioned earlier, we have received modest revenue upside from our consumer premium SKUs versus what we get on Windows XP Pro or Windows Vista Business. 
Server and tools revenue should grow 16% to 17% for the year from continued growth of SQL Server, development tools and our enterprise services. Revenue for the third quarter should also be up 16% to 17%. 
We forecast revenue in the online services business to grow between 3% and 8% for the year and 4% to 10% in quarter 3. Although we're still forecasting growth in search queries and page views, our plans now include a more measured rate of growth for the balance of the year. Our full year forecast anticipates total advertising growth in the mid-teens, and we expect this to be driven in particular by our display business, which is growing at a healthy rate, as we see good page growth in our key properties. We continue to have high aspirations to grow this business and we will continue to invest in the business during the second half. 
Microsoft business division revenue should increased 10% to 11% for the year, an increase of 2 percentage points from the guidance we gave you last quarter on increased business uptake of the 2007 Office system. Q3 revenue should grow 27% to 28%. Our third quarter revenue guidance includes the recognition of approximately $0.5 billion of revenue deferred from the second quarter related to our tech guarantee program and 2007 Office system preshipments into the channel. If you were to adjust for that impact, revenue growth for quarter 3 would have been 13% into 14%. We are encouraged by the favorable customer response we saw in December surrounding our new products. 
In the entertainment and devices division, we are pleased with what we have been able to accomplish in the past year, including achieving our goal of having sold over 10 million consoles life to date, outselling competitive next-generation consoles during this holiday season, achieving record software attach rates and reaching 5 million Xbox Live members. With that strong momentum, we are making tradeoffs and choices in managing the Xbox business to achieve our targeted profitability in fiscal year '08. In the near term, this means we will optimize for profitability. We believe this puts us in a strong market and financial position as we go into fiscal 2008, a year that will feature a number of catalysts, highlighted by the strongest first and third-party game lineup we've ever had. 
As we look at historical seasonality, pricing and inventory levels, we're taking a more cautious view of the market, and our half 2 revenue and console guidance reflects that. We are now forecasting full year revenue growth of 26% to 31% and a decline of 15% to 25% for the third quarter and expect to exit June having sold about 12 million Xbox 360 units since launch, down from our previous guidance of 13 million to 15 million. That reduction in console units also results in a reduction in revenue related to attached software, accessories and Live. 
Moving on to operating income, for the year we expect to generate between $19.3 billion and $19.7 billion of operating income, representing growth of 10% to 12%, excluding legal charges taken in fiscal 2006. This is an increase of approximately $200 million on both the low end and high end, this is what we told you in October, now representing double-digit growth even at the low end. We are flowing through some of the revenue upside and keeping full year spending in line with what we had in October. For the third quarter, we expect operating income to be between $6.1 billion and $6.3 billion, including the impact from revenue recognized from our tech guarantee and preshipments. Excluding this impact, operating income for the third quarter would be between $4.4 billion and $4.6 billion. 
Third quarter operating income includes some costs deferred from the second quarter, as well as operating costs in preparation for the launches of Windows Vista and the 2007 Office system. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue for the full year should increase by 1 percentage point over last year, in line with what we said in October. We continue to estimate a full year tax rate of 31%, consistent with what we saw in the second quarter and with our October guidance. 
Diluted earnings per share, we're bringing up the range for the year by $0.02 at the low end and $0.01 at the high end due to higher revenue in our core businesses of client, server and tools, and MBD. This translates into a full-year expected range of $1.45 to $1.47 and $0.45 to $0.46 for the third quarter. The third quarter earnings per share includes approximately $0.12 per share associated with the impact of the tech guarantee program. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we expect unearned revenue to finish fiscal 2007 up 6% to 8% due to our better performance in Q2. Contracted not billed should also finished 2007 up from where we exited fiscal 2006. When thinking about sequential changes in unearned revenue from quarter 2 to quarter 3, we expect a decline of slightly greater than $1.7 billion of revenue we'll recognize associate with our tech guarantee program and presales. This decline would be consistent with normal seasonality. 
For our full year unearned revenue guidance, we're modeling a moderation in the recent annuity mix of our billings as both the 2007 Office system and Windows Vista will be available to customers in the second half of the year. I'll remind you though, as you think about guidance for the rest of the year, we still face the risks and opportunities I have highlighted in our previous two earnings calls: for example, competitive, legal, execution and general market risks; as well as PC and server hardware growth rates, customer acceptance of our products, and the costs to remain competitive, such as those to acquire and serve customers in our online businesses. Also, our emerging businesses are harder to forecast when compared to our mature businesses, so as they continue to become a larger part of our overall financial mix, they may contribute to increased volatility in our quarterly performance. 
Before moving to questions and answers, I would like to make a couple of quick comments. I committed to you at our financial analyst meeting last year to provide you with a more continuous flow of information throughout the year, and that would include communication from Steve and me. 
We will do that on February 15 in New York City, and for those of you unable to join us for that, we will make available a live webcast as well as an on-demand replay of the presentation. The intention of this presentation is for Steve and me to meet with investors and provide an update on our strategic direction after completing our internal strategy meetings. Although we may generally discuss revenue and spending trend levels, we will not give any detailed financial information. As in past years, we will provide our first preliminary review of fiscal 2008 guidance on our third quarter earnings call in April. 
Since the financial analyst meeting in July, we have also had executives out talking with the financial community in a variety of forums at a pace over once a month outside of our quiet periods. Looking forward into half 2, we will double that frequency. In general, we have been trying to give you more overall exposure to all of our senior executives and we look forward to seeing you. 
With that, I'll hand the call over to Colleen so we can get started with some of your questions. Thank you. 
Colleen Healy
Thanks, Chris. Let's now proceed to questions. We want to accommodate questions from as many people as possible, so please avoid multi-part questions and please limit yourself to just one question. Operator, will you please repeat your instructions? 
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
 (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Heather Bellini - UBS. 
 Heather Bellini - UBS
Good afternoon, Chris and Colleen. I was wondering if you could give us your assumptions for higher price SKU mix in the March quarter, because if we adjust for the technology reversal that you are going to have in March, then it appears that you're looking for client segment growth of roughly 20% versus a PC shipment forecast that is about half that. 
The second question I would have is that for Service Pack 1, it typically comes out one year after the release of Windows, if we look back historically. I'm just wondering if we should be thinking less than that now, given your desire to shorten Windows development cycles. 
 Chris Liddell
 In terms of the quarter 3, if I work through the math of taking you from the shipment units that we see down to the revenue, that will probably help you the most. And then I will talk about service packs. As I mentioned in the formal remarks, we expect shipments in the third quarter to be 9% to 11%. We are assuming that our units that we sell will be at the top end of that range, 11%, so we'll still have a modest improvement. 
The main factor that is going to drive the revenue is going to be on the commercial and retail. So we will, again as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we will certainly get a significant impact from that element of the revenue that is commercial and retail. As you'll recall, that's only about 20% of the total revenue but we're expecting it to grow significantly relative to the previous year, obviously, with Vista being available for the first time. 
So those will be, in essence, the main drivers. You are right, that will get us up to revenue growth that is close to 20% for the quarter. 
 Heather Bellini - UBS
On the service pack side? 
Colleen Healy
 On the service pack side, Heather, we have seen a lot of the same rumors that you probably have in the press in terms of dates. The company hasn't put a date out there. It always makes sense to see how the product does out of the gate, continue to get feedback and we don't have an SP date to share with you today. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Charlie DiBona - Sanford Bernstein. 
 Charlie DiBona - Sanford Bernstein
Hi, Chris. I was wondering if we could turn to the online services business. It looks like the display ads are doing fine, but search is slipping share pretty consistently in all the independent numbers. You have now lowered guidance, it looks like while you might be growing search a little bit you are certainly going to continue to slip share if you stick to this guidance. How should we be looking at this business? How can we evaluate progress here? When can we expect a turnaround? 
 Chris Liddell
 You are right, Charlie, to break the business down into its different bits. Clearly, the overall results are impacted by adCenter decline. but if I take that out and look at the advertising revenue overall, it grew 20% for the quarter, which we're happy with. If you break that down into display and search, clearly there is a better story on the display side, and we are growing broadly in line market. So I'd like to think we can put a tick in that box and we are comfortable with the progress we are making there. 
On the search side, you are correct that we lost market share certainly relative to the independent assessment during the quarter, and are clearly not happy with that. We continue to take a long term view of this business. We continue to invest in it, and we are making progress in the short term on some of the factors that we think are important: getting advertisers onto our adCenter platform, turning the corner in terms of revenue on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Since we went off Overture, the second quarter is the first quarter where we are seeing consecutive growth in revenue and we still expect to get revenue per search equal to where we were a year ago by the end of this year. So we are making progress in some of the underlying factors and we are continuing to invest. But I expect you should and we should expect to see more progress in the long term on the search side. 
 Charlie DiBona - Sanford Bernstein
 Does there come a time when you can share some of those metrics you say are doing better internally? Because we don't see them out here. 
Colleen Healy
From a communications standpoint, Charlie, what we've really set up is at our financial analyst meeting there are some specific metrics that we told you you will hear, really from Kevin Johnson: breadth of usage, depth of usage and how we're doing on monetization, really similar to our competitors in terms of providing some of those underlying drivers quarter by quarter. 
It is not something that we are doing, it doesn't necessarily make sense from a competitive standpoint. There tends to also be pretty decent third-party information out there. But you will continue to hear from the business leaders, as well as Chris, directly at FAM on those metrics that we outlined at the financial analyst meeting last year, and we'll update you again on at least a yearly basis. 
 Chris Liddell
 Charlie, the other thing I would say is once we lap coming off Overture you'll be able to do a much better comparison because then we are comparing ourselves to ourselves. So in two or three quarters I think the comparables year on year will be much easier for you to make an assessment of progress. Also, as the impact of the access business decline becomes much less significant, then you are really looking at the underlying business growth. So it won't necessarily get to the level of granularity that I know you have consistently been looking for. But I think it will become, hopefully, more useful to you. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch. 
 Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch
Hi, thank you very much. Just to clarify the Xbox commentary, Chris, is that more of an inventory flush-out that causes you to lower the guidance for the rest of the year? 
Also, if you could comment on the premium mix. If you experience better mix shift to the higher-end versions of Vista after the launch, will that cause the company to raise its guidance for the client business or is that already factored into the guidance? That’s it, thanks. 
 Chris Liddell
 On the Xbox side, certainly the healthy inventory that we have seen which is partially a result of the very good sales that we saw into the channel in the second quarter last year, is one of the factors behind what we're looking for in the second half. Also, as we start to think about fiscal year '08 and what's the best approach to take for fiscal year '08 in terms of profitability, so we're just making some strategic decisions around what we might do there, too. So it is those two things, broadly speaking, which are the reasons why we are giving the guidance we are. 
On the premium side, we have embedded inside the guidance that we have given you the premium mix that we now have of 60%. So that is reflected in the guidance for fiscal year '07. Clearly, as Colleen mentioned, inside that 60% there is a mix within a mix, so depending on how that came out between the consumer SKUs and the business SKUs, if that changed, the 60% could still be the case, but we could have a different revenue number there. But at this stage, based on our expectation of the premium mix and how the business and consumer elements of that were made up, that is reflected in the guidance. 
 Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch
 So you are not assuming any change in the business versus the consumer within the premium as it relates to '07 guidance just as yet? You're basically using the same experience as with XP to make your forecast, right? 
 Chris Liddell
 It is not the same experience as XP. It is the same experience, if you like, as what we forecast at the beginning of the year. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Rick Sherlund - Goldman Sachs. 
 Rick Sherlund - Goldman Sachs
Thanks. Chris, the launch of Vista, Office 2007 and Exchange Server coming up at the end of this month, if I want to be a little more optimistic about the revenues in Q3, you've given a little bit of precise guidance there and I'm just not sure how predictable the demand is going to be. I'd just ask you to talk to that issue in terms of your ability to forecast for Q3, given the launch of some pretty major new products and whether you might think it reasonable to think that we could see more upside in Q3. 
 Chris Liddell
 Richard, we've talked about it before, I think this is different from if you go back a decade, obviously, to a Windows 95 impact. We certainly think it would be positive, but more gradual as it rolls out into the marketplace. In terms of the impact on overall sales, we were heartened by the quarter 2 results. We are certainly heartened by the fact that the tech guarantee appeared to avoid any stalling of sales in that quarter. But we are sticking with the external numbers that you have seen and that is flowing through in turn to our second half. 
Could there be some upside to that? Yes, clearly there is, but obviously there could be some downside as well. I talk about that on the risks and opportunities side. If the product was extremely well received and if there was very strong demand at say the top end of our expectations for the second half, clearly that would flow through. At this stage, it is launching next week, and we're taking what we consider to be just an appropriately conservative view of the second half. 
 Rick Sherlund - Goldman Sachs
SQL Server up 30%-plus again this quarter against a launch last year of the new product, I'm a little surprised that we are continuing to see 30%-plus growth from that product, particularly on a tougher comparison. Any light you can shed on what is happening or why we're seeing such robust growth there? 
 Chris Liddell
 Yes, we were positively surprised on the upside there, too. The only thing I would say is that the price increase went in during the quarter. So you've got some part of the quarter which is price impacted, if you like. So it will definitely become a much harder comparable in the second half. But in terms of underlying sales, it was a good quarter, you are right. 
 Rick Sherlund - Goldman Sachs
Chris, on the Xbox, just finally, I hear what you're saying that you want to manage inventory levels down it sounds like, over the next couple of quarters. Certainly if there were a price reduction coming, you would want to minimize your channel inventory levels before you would do something like that. Am I understanding correctly that what you're trying to do is manage inventory levels down for Xbox in the second fiscal half? 
 Chris Liddell
 I wouldn't put it in those terms. We are looking at the numbers that we sell into the channel based on where we see the inventory at the start of the year and the patterns of sales that we think will come up. So the net result of that may well be that we see inventory come down. But if you like, it is an outcome, not a management of that. 
 Rick Sherlund - Goldman Sachs
 You're not seeing any change in the competitive environment; there's no change in your assumptions of market share? 
 Chris Liddell
 No. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Adam Holt – JP Morgan. 
 Adam Holt - JP Morgan
Good afternoon. You made a number of comments about the ASP and premium mix expectations around Windows. I was hoping maybe you could talk a little bit about what you are expecting within Office. Obviously, you have got a number of new SKUs with Small Business Pro/Ultimate. What does the guidance imply in terms of ASP improvement and what do you think is reasonable for us to expect? 
 Chris Liddell
 Well, to the extent that obviously we're just giving guidance for the balance of this year it is not a huge impact. There is clearly revenue coming through from the first half which is not significantly impacted by that and so there is not a huge impact in the whole of fiscal year '07. Having said that, we did see renewal rates, as Colleen mentioned, at the top end of our 66% to 75% historic range. One of the reasons for that we feel was people anticipating the Office and therefore being attracted to renew. So that, to some extent, flows through in the second half. But in terms of an overall mix shift, it's not a significant component of the fiscal year '07 revenue. 
 Adam Holt - JP Morgan
If I could just ask a follow up on the strength in unearned, what I was particularly taken with was the client side. If you net out undelivered, it looks like you had better than 30% growth in client unearned. Could you talk about what you are seeing in terms of enterprise renewal activity, reattachment to enterprise licensing, and maybe refresh us on your thinking in terms of what you're expecting for enterprise adoption as we get further into the cycle? 
Colleen Healy
On the annuity side, as with Office, a bit with client as you're talking, we have seen really nice renewal rates. They have been really trending at the high end. In particular, to your point, when you look at the various parts going into unearned, we are seeing a bit of an uptick in terms of customers adding Windows under their enterprise agreements. We think the value proposition from the enterprise view is compelling. And of course, you can only get if you are an annuity customer, so that looks promising. But really, I would say at this point, a bit too early to get ahead of ourselves. But we have been noticing that a bit as well. 
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from Brent Thill - Citigroup. 
 Brent Thill - Citigroup
Thanks. Chris, just a follow-up to Adam's question on Office. The reviews have been very solid, and just wondering if you could help us understand what the rationale is, why pricing can't go up in the face of that, considering this is a pretty big release. If you look at the server business, you have raised pricing and it doesn't feel like there has been any pushback. 
Colleen Healy
 What we could say on the pricing side, actually, is certainly in terms of the upper end views, we have put more value into those offerings. For example, on the Professional Plus offering, which adds the Communicator IM Client and other things, pricing went up a bit, call it 5% or so. On the enterprise SKU, which has Pro and Windows and grew, we did take the opportunity to add more value there. We expect to see some pricing uplift there. So really what you're seeing, whether it is SQL or Office or some of the other products you mentioned, it is really more SKU differentiation that you heard from us really at the financial analyst meeting a year ago, and we are really continuing to look for opportunities to provide value in higher-end SKUs and price accordingly. 
But again, we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves in terms of adoption rates. Keep in mind that a lot of these products, in particular on Office, because there's already quite a bit going into annuity, you actually recognize that over a period of time on the P&L. 
 Chris Liddell
From our perspective, at a particular price point, the concept of increasingly trying to add value at that price point over time through software development is just a good philosophy. So we certainly don't think just because we are adding functionality that we should necessarily increase price. 
In terms of our renewals now in the post-Vista and Office era, the ability to actually offer new products and hence look at enterprise agreements that are much broader, much more of infrastructure-based agreements rather than desktop agreements, is more of the potential. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Jason Maynard - Credit Suisse. 
 Jason Maynard - Credit Suisse
Hi, guys. I have a question on spending. You had indicated that Q2 was a little lower than expected in marketing program spend. Server and tools, I think, did $1 billion in op income. How do you think about Q2 in terms of its impact on spending in the back half of the year and even longer term as you look to invest in places like online services and then even potentially in entertainment devices? 
 Chris Liddell
 We have kept, again, our expenses very much in the context of the year and we have kept our expense number for the year the same as where it has been essentially all year. I am increasingly happy with the discipline we are showing there for the year. In terms of the quarter-by-quarter movement, we certainly give the people flexibility on a quarterly basis to spend on programs as is necessary. We can see swings, in particular in some of the marketing spends with some of the launches on a quarter-by-quarter basis. So I wouldn't get too concerned one way or the other. In this case, it's a positive trend on the expenses year to date. I tend to focus on what our expectations are for the year and at this stage, they haven't changed. 
 Jason Maynard - Credit Suisse
Maybe just help me reconcile, operating cash flow came in just a touch above $2 billion, which was a little lower than I think most of us were modeling. Can you maybe help us understand the puts and takes on the cash flow number? 
 Chris Liddell
 To some extent, there was obviously inventory builds. We had a relatively high number of Xbox sales and so that does tend to impact our cash flow for the quarter. There could well be, depending on the line you're looking at, the big billings area. So a big unearned can influence the cash flow aspect of it as well. But there were no significant issues. Buyback was relatively high, but we also had the JP Morgan options exercised, so nothing unusual there. I would describe it as a reasonably predictable cash flow quarter, albeit with some big movements inside it. 
Colleen Healy
Thanks so much. We have time for a just a few more questions. Our next question please.

 Robert Breza - RBC Capital Markets
Hi, good afternoon. Real quickly, Chris, maybe as a follow-up to the last question, when you look at the leverage you showed this quarter and a little bit of lack of spending in the back half of the year, where do you see additional leverage coming from? What levers do you think that are there that you could execute to deliver upside? 
 Chris Liddell
 Well it's more likely to be on the revenue side. Clearly, we have the opportunity to cut expenses and some of the decisions that we can make, we could, for example, decide to cut back on marketing for the second half of the year. I don't think we will, but we could do it. The upside potential really comes more on the revenue side and that really comes across the board. So clearly, in our client and office division, as Rick's question alluded to earlier, with a launch there's a big amount of variability around that. So there could be some upside there. But we've guided to what we think is probably the appropriate level. 
In the online services area, there's probably not such a big swing factor there in the overall context of the company, but clearly our ability to continue to generate display advertising and change market share in search has some impact. 
And then on the entertainment and devices, really it's to a large extent on the revenue side, it is an Xbox story. Again, we have taken what we think is the most likely scenario there. Given the relative seasonality, the June half is a lot less significant than the December half in the Xbox business, so I don't see a high degree of variability. But again, that would be something that would be a big factor. 
Each of the businesses has their own dynamic. But if you're looking for the things that could swing, it is really in our core businesses with those big launches.

Great, thank you, nice quarter.

Your next question comes from Tim Klasell - Thomas Weisel Partners. 
 Tim Klasell - Thomas Weisel Partners
Going to Vista, you've mentioned in the past that you won't be having to hold back the 5% to 25% going into deferred. That should be about $150 million to $250 million a quarter as that rolls off the next three years. Is that the right way to think about that, and is that still the way you plan on doing it? 
 Chris Liddell
 We had quite an extensive discussion last quarter about that. I think we stated that we will give you guidance for fiscal year '08 in our next quarter in terms of exactly how much we expect from that. We want to be transparent about how much is the underlying business, how much is simply just the different revenue recognition. It will be order of magnitude in the sort of numbers you're talking about, but it is too early at this stage to give actual numbers out. 
 Tim Klasell - Thomas Weisel Partners
Good. One final question, Longhorn, if we look out a little further, how is that tracking and are you still planning on an end of the year release? 
 Chris Liddell
 Yes, we are. 
Colleen Healy
 Longhorn is tracking. We are expecting really to RTM for the second half of calendar year 2007 and I think you'll hear more from us over time on that. 
Great, thanks so much. We have time for one last question, please. 
Operator
Your final question comes from John McPeake - Prudential. 
 John McPeake - Prudential
A question about online offering and dynamics [inaudible] Could you talk a little bit about how Codename Titan, the online product, is going to roll out and the timing there? 
 Chris Liddell
 You are little faint there, sorry. But I picked up your question in terms of Titan, have we gone public on the timing for that? 
Colleen Healy
 We have. 
 Chris Liddell
 That's the summer this year. So we are on track for that, as we talked about. So that will be in the summer, in six months, if you like. 
 John McPeake - Prudential
Does Xbox inventory drawdown have anything to do with potentially a new version of Xbox coming out first fiscal half? 
 Chris Liddell
 No. That was an easy one. 
Colleen Healy

Good afternoon, and welcome to the Microsoft 2007 fiscal year first quarter conference call. (Operator Instructions)  I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Colleen Healy, General Manager, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Colleen Healy
Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. This afternoon I am joined by Chris Liddell, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Corporate Vice President of Finance and Administration and Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel.
Today's call will start with Chris providing some key takeaways for the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 and an overview of expectations for the rest of the fiscal year. I will then provide detail around our first quarter results, and then turn it back to Chris for a more detailed discussion of our guidance for the full year and the second quarter of fiscal 2007. After that, we'll take your questions.
We filed our 10-Q today in conjunction with our earnings release. Therefore, you have available the earnings release, MD&A, financial statements and footnotes. We have also posted our quarterly financial summary slide deck, which is intended to follow the flow of our prepared remarks in order to assist you.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
With that, let me now turn it over to Chris.
Chris Liddell 
Thanks, Colleen, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to be with you today to share our first quarter results and talk with you about how we see the rest of fiscal 2007 shaping up.
Looking back over the first quarter, I would characterize it as a very good start to what we are expecting to be an excellent year. All aspects of our financial performance came in at or above the high end of our guidance. Our product groups made considerable progress executing on major product milestones towards their launches in quarter two and beyond, and we continued our progress on returning cash to shareholders, including through our tender offer.
Looking back to our first quarter financial performance, revenue came in at the high-end of our guidance, growing 11%, which represents over $1 billion in absolute revenue growth. Server and Tools and our Entertainment and Devices division were particularly strong in the quarter, benefiting from continued customer demand for SQL Server and the Xbox 360.
Operating income benefited from both the strong revenue growth, as well as lower spending, primarily on marketing programs, which we shifted out of quarter one and into the rest of the year. Combining that with increased investment income, as we increased liquidity in preparation for the tender offer, our earnings per share results were excellent.
This was an important quarter for our business groups, as we made significant progress towards a number of milestones leading up to our product launches in coming months. During the quarter we rolled out Release Candidate 1 of Windows Vista, a Beta 2 technical refresh of the 2007 Office system, a Beta of Exchange Server 2007, and announced the upcoming launch of Zune. To date, these trial versions have been made available to about 5 million Windows Vista users and over 3 million 2007 Office System users. We've been receiving encouraging feedback from partners and customers who are using the betas, which are the most widely-tested releases in the history of these products.
We also continue to be active on the acquisition front, averaging more than one a month. This quarter the bulk of our acquisitions were companies that augment the offerings of our Server and Tools business. Our acquisitions focused on the areas of systems recovery and data protection, virtualization, and security.
Finally, on the capital structure front, we continue to make steady progress. We finished our prior $30 billion repurchase plan, as we shared with you on the last earnings call, announced a new authorization that runs through July 2011, completed our tender offer, made additional share repurchases outside of the tender offer in the quarter, and increased our quarterly dividend.
Moving now to the full fiscal year, 2007 is shaping up well. We will be delivering the second major installment on our multi-year product cycle, helping to fuel revenue growth for the Company. So, let me make a couple of key points about fiscal 2007. First, we continue to expect full-year double-digit revenue growth. In terms of quarterly trends, revenue growth will be impacted by the deferral of approximately $1.5 billion of Client and MBD revenue out of the second quarter and into our third quarter, as a result of the recently-announced technology guarantee programs. As we discussed on the call hosted by Frank and Scott earlier in the week, this movement has no impact on our full-year numbers.
Second, growth in operating income in the first half of the year will be impacted by the increasing mix of Xbox 360 console revenue and related costs, coupled with significant investments to support the launches of our flagship products, and the accounting impact of the technology guarantee programs. This trend should reverse in the second half of the year, when we expect operating income will grow considerably faster than revenue.
Finally, excluding legal charges in the prior year, we will grow earnings per share 13% to 15% while launching major products and continuing to invest in the future growth opportunities in all our business divisions. I'm particularly happy that we've been able to broadly maintain our full year earnings per share guidance. Better business performance and higher investment income have helped offset the impact of lower share repurchases in our tender offer and the higher effective tax rate.
With those high level things for the quarter and the full year 2007, I'm going to turn the call over to Colleen now for more details on our first quarter performance.
Colleen Healy
Thanks, Chris. In the interest of providing more time for your questions, I'm going to keep my remarks regarding the fiscal first quarter brief. Overall, we are off to a good start in what is a significant year for the Company. Specifically during the quarter, we delivered revenue, operating income and EPS growth at or above the high end of our guidance. We made significant progress on development and launch readiness for key products in the pipeline, including Windows Vista, Office 2007, Exchange Server 2007, and Zune. We returned $7.9 million in capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
I will now provide more detail on our financial performance, starting with revenue. I will discuss top line financial and business momentum points, and then follow up with revenue performance for each of the business units. All growth comparisons I mention relate to the comparable quarter of last year unless otherwise specified.
Revenue growth for the quarter was 11%, driven primarily by the business groups significant product launches over the past 12 months, as our new product cycles have been well received by customers. Specifically, Entertainment and Devices and Server and Tools accounted for over 70% of the absolute revenue growth in the quarter.
Healthy PC and server hardware market growth were also key contributors to our results. The PC market grew 8% to 10% in the quarter, driven by a good back-to-school sales season. Consumer growth outpaced that of business, consistent with the trend of the past several quarters. Geographically, we saw double-digit growth in Asia and Latin America, with the remaining regions growing at single digits.
Server hardware shipment growth was consistent with our full-year estimate of 10% to 12%. Our mix of product billings was approximately 40% from OEMs; 25% from multi-year licensing agreements; 20% from license-only sales; and the balance from our other businesses. These results were generally consistent with the prior year. We had a good quarter from a volume licensing perspective and saw strong performance in our small and medium business channel in particular.
In terms of enterprise agreements, we highlighted in July that there was a relatively small amount of EA contract value up for renewals in the first quarter, which would impact EA. Of the business that was up for renewal, we continued to see EA renewal rates within our historical range of 66% to 75%. Non-annuity growth was relatively weak, as expected, in front of major product launches later this year.
Our unearned revenue balance ended the quarter at $10.1 billion, up 15% over the prior year and slightly stronger than we expected. The sequential decline in the unearned balance in the first quarter was driven by the absolute size of our fiscal Q4 annuity billings relative to Q1, as well as the small amount of EA contract value up for renewal, as previously discussed. Our contracted not-billed balance at the end of September was sequentially lower, but continues to exceed $9 billion.
Now I'd like to provide revenue highlights by business segment. Starting with Client, revenue for the quarter grew 4% to $3.3 billion. OEM revenue growth of 4% resulted from 11% growth in license units. The 7 percentage point difference between OEM license unit growth and revenue growth was caused primarily by increasing volumes in emerging markets, the relative strength of the consumer segment of the market, and a $45 million revenue deferral related to the Express upgrade to Windows Vista program. We were particularly pleased with the continued adoption of Windows Media Center Edition, which represented over 15% of OEM license mix in the quarter, and has now sold over 20 million units to date.
Client, commercial and retail licensing product growth of 5% was primarily driven by growth in multi-year contract agreements in front of the Windows Vista launch. We made significant progress on Windows Vista development during the quarter, as evidenced by the recent availability of the second release candidate. We made pre-release versions of Windows Vista available to over 5 million customers worldwide.
Server and Tools revenue growth of 17% represents the 17th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth for the segment. Results for the quarter were driven by broad adoption of our Server and Tools product line, particularly SQL Server, which grew over 30%, Windows Server and Digital Studio. During the quarter we completed the acquisition of Softricity, Whale Communications, Winternals Software and DesktopStandard, which will strengthen our growing Server business around virtualization, enterprise security and management.
Revenue for our Online Service business was down 4% to $539 million, with 5% advertising growth and a 30% decline in access revenue. Increased advertising revenue was driven by growth in display advertising, offset by lower search revenues. With respect to search, although our search queries grew, our search pricing was below the prior-year levels as a result of the transition to our new adCenter platform, which began in earnest during the December quarter. We experienced sequential growth in revenue per search as we increased the number of advertisers on our platform. During the quarter we also released a number of new or updated Internet services, including Live.com, Live Search, Live Local Search and Live Spaces.
Microsoft Business division revenue grew 4% to $3.4 billion, a good result in front of the upcoming product launches of Office 2007 and Exchange Server 2007, and in line with our expectations entering the quarter. As with Windows Vista, we also made considerable progress on the development of the 2007 Office system. We released the Beta 2 technical refresh of the product during the quarter and over 3 million customers have pre-release versions of Office 2007. Business momentum and customer interest for both Office 2007 and Exchange Server 2007 remains strong, leading us to the launches later this year. We also delivered strong performance in our Dynamic business in the first quarter, with customer billings growth of 19%.
Lastly, Entertainment and Devices growth of 70% for the quarter was driven by strong performance across all of its businesses. Interactive gaming revenue in particular more than doubled as a result of Xbox 360 platform momentum. We have sold 6 million consoles life to date, and Xbox 360 software and accessory attach rates have remained at record levels in the U.S. relative to any previous console launches from competitors.
Momentum for Xbox Live continued to build as well, passing the 4 million member mark during the quarter. In addition to strength in gaming, our Mobile and Embedded Device business recorded its sixth consecutive quarter of revenue growth in excess of 40%, as licenses for Windows mobile-based phones more than tripled. Finally, we announced the next step in our Connected Entertainment division with the coming availability of the Zune digital media player and online service for U.S. consumers starting on November 14.
Now for the rest of the income statement. While revenue increased 11% for the quarter, the cost of revenue increased 35%, due primarily to Xbox 360. As a result, gross margin relative to the prior year was down 3 percentage points for the quarter, consistent with the guidance we provided in July.
First quarter operating expenses, other than cost of revenue, increased $560 million, or 14%, excluding certain legal charges in the prior year quarter. While we continue to invest aggressively in both R&D and sales and marketing to drive future growth, expenses this quarter were lighter than we expected, primarily due to the timing of marketing program spend.
Operating income for the quarter was $4.5 billion, up modestly from the prior year excluding certain legal charges in that year-ago quarter. Investment income and other totaled $567 million, driven by larger than expected gains on investment sales to fund our tender offer during the quarter.
Our effective tax rate came in at 31%, slightly higher than the estimate provided to you in our guidance last call, due to the change in the mix of earnings in various tax jurisdictions.
During the quarter we continued to execute against our strategy of returning capital to shareholders. We repurchased $7 billion of company stock, including nearly $4 billion through our tender offer, and paid out $9 million in dividends during the quarter. Diluted shares outstanding were 10 billion, down 7% from the prior year as a result of execution against our share repurchase program. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.35, $0.03 above the high end of the range we provided in July.
So, in summary, Q1 was a good start to fiscal 2007. The solid revenue results for the quarter were at the top end of our expectations, and EPS exceeded our expectations with an exciting and important fiscal year now underway.
Chris will now provide you with our expectations for the second quarter and fiscal year 2007.
Chris Liddell 
Thanks, Colleen. I'm going to spend my remaining time on the call talking about what we see coming for the full year and the second quarter. Before we get into the specific guidance, let me outline some of our key assumptions. Our fiscal 2007 forecast assumes no major changes in the economic conditions and demand from where we exited the first quarter, and we are not forecasting any significant impacts from foreign exchange rate movements.
We expect PC unit growth for fiscal 2007 to be 8% to 10% for the year, in line with the guidance we gave you last quarter, and between 6% and 8% for the second quarter. We continue to estimate that PC unit growth rates will be higher in the Consumer segment than in the Business segment, and higher in emerging markets than in mature markets. On the server hardware front, we remain comfortable with our estimates for total market growth of 10% to 12% for the year.
Now let me go through our detailed guidance. For the full year we expect our revenue to come in between $50 billion and $50.9 billion, growing 13% to 15%. We are bringing up our revenue range to reflect how we finished quarter one, as well as also raising the top slightly. Our growth is driven by forward-based revenue growth across our five segments. For the second quarter we expect revenue of $11.8 billion to $12.4 billion, which represents quarterly growth of flat to up 5%.
There are a couple of items to note when you consider our second-quarter revenue. First, the revenue figures for the second quarter include the impact of us deferring approximately $1.5 billion, primarily from our technology guarantee programs. Again, this simply defers the recognition of revenue from the second quarter into the third quarter. There is no full-year impact of these programs on revenue. Before these impacts, revenue guidance would have been $13.3 billion to $13.9 billion, which represents growth of 12% to 17%.
Second, we expect PC unit growth in the second quarter to remain healthy, but moderate from the growth rate we saw in our fiscal first quarter, as well as from the growth rates we saw last year in second quarter. 
With that, revenue guidance in our five business units is as follows:
For Client, we expect full-year growth to be 9% to 10% and second-quarter growth to be down 25% to 27%. This full-year guidance includes the impact of revenue recognition changes for Windows Vista, as was discussed on our call on Tuesday. Our second quarter guidance includes the deferral of approximately $1 billion in revenue out of the quarter and into the third quarter. $1 billion covers revenue associated with both our technology guarantee program, as well as amounts for Windows Vista pre-shipments into the channel ahead of launch. If you were to normalize for the $1 billion of deferrals, second-quarter revenue would be growing 4% to 6%.
Looking at the full-year growth, the commercial and retail portion of the Client segment should pick up in the second half due to our launch of Windows Vista targeted for volume licensing customers in November, and with broad availability in January. We expect Client OEM revenue to grow slightly below the PC hardware market for the year, due to increased concentration among larger OEMs, consumer hardware shipments growing faster than business shipments, and relatively faster growth in emerging markets.
Server and Tools revenue should grow 15% to 16% for the year and 14% to 15% for the second quarter. We continue to expect double-digit growth throughout the year from the sustained momentum of SQL Server and from growth in Windows Server, developer tools, our application business, and enterprise services. As we approach the anniversary of the SQL Server and Visual Studio launches, quarterly performance in the second half of the year will face tougher year-over-year comparables.
We forecast revenue in the Online Services business to grow between 7% and 11% for the year and to be up 3% to 5% in quarter two. The full-year growth number implies significant year-over-year growth in the second half, based upon growth in both search and display advertising revenues. While we continue to make investments in various aspects of the business, we did make progress on a number of fronts in the quarter. For example, we rolled out the Live Search, which now powers searches on both MSN.com and Live.com, moved our Live Local Search out of beta and into final availability in both the U.S. and the UK, continued to grow and broaden our social networking presence with spaces and the recent beta rollout of Soapbox, and we're making good progress getting advertisers on adCenter, as well as looking at opportunities to extend our reach through partnerships.
Microsoft Business division revenues should grow 8% to 9% for the year and be down 8% to 10% in the second quarter. The full year guidance now includes the impact of Dynamics revenue recognition we talked about earlier in the week, and that's close to what we gave you in July. Our second quarter revenue guidance includes approximately $500 million being deferred out of the second quarter and into the third quarter, due to both our technology guarantee program as well as a small amount of revenue associated with Office 2007 pre-shipments into the channel. If you were to normalize for the impact of the technology guarantee program, revenue growth for quarter two would be 3% to 5%. Fiscal 2007 is MBD's biggest year ever for product launches, with major releases in all areas of the business: Office, Exchange, Dynamics, and Office Live.
For the Entertainment and Devices division, we're forecasting full year revenue growth of 33% to 46% and second quarter growth of 50% to 75%. With 6 million Xbox 360 consoles sold life to date and a portfolio of 160 high-definition games by the end of the year, we remain optimistic that we will exit the holiday having sold over 10 million units since launch and end our fiscal year having sold 13 million to 15 million units since launch.
Operating income for the year is expected to be between $19.1 billion and $19.5 billion, growing 9% to 11%, excluding legal charges taken in fiscal 2006. In the second quarter we expect operating income to be between $2.9 billion and $3.1 billion, including approximately $1.5 billion of impact from revenue deferred from our technology guarantee and preshipment. The $1.5 billion results from revenue recognition that is deferred from the second quarter into the third quarter and there's no full year impact to this program to operating income, as we've mentioned. Excluding the impact of the technology guarantee, operating income for the second quarter would be between $4.4 billion  and $4.7 billion.
Second quarter operating income includes the impact of higher overall mix of lower-margin hardware revenue from Xbox 360 and Zune, increased costs associated with the Online Services group, as well as operating costs in preparation for the launches of Windows Vista and the 2007 Office system.
On our last earnings call we gave you additional color and guidance on cost of goods sold, given the evolving mix of our businesses. Even though we may not always do so each quarter, let me give you an update on COGS today. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue for the second quarter should increase by $0.08 to $0.09 over quarter two of last year. The increase results from a larger number of Xbox 360 consoles, plus the inclusion of Zune units. We're remaining with our previous guidance on the full year being up one to two points.
We're also updating our guidance on our effective tax rate for the year. In July we estimated the full year effective tax rate of 30.5%, but due to a change in the mix of earnings in various tax jurisdictions, we are now estimating a full year tax rate of 31%, consistent with what we saw in the first quarter.
Diluted earnings per share for the year are expected to come in at $1.43 to $1.46, and $0.22 to $0.24 for the second quarter. Second quarter EPS, excluding the impact of the technology guarantee, would have been $0.33 to $0.35. I'm pleased that, as a result of better business results and investment income, we have been able to keep our guidance largely in line with the full year guidance we gave you in July.
I'd like to take a moment now to drill down a bit on the makeup of our full-year EPS numbers. We told you back in July that we estimated the impact of the full completion of our tender offer would be $0.05 to $0.06 for the full fiscal year. Since only a portion of the shares were tendered, I wanted to do a quick reconciliation from our full year guidance in July to what we're giving you today.
First, instead of buying the previously contemplated $20 billion worth of shares during the quarter through our tender offer, we repurchased a total of $4.8 billion, which comprised of $3.8 billion worth of stock through our tender offer, plus an additional $1 billion we made in open market purchases during the quarter. The lower repurchases will reduce our estimate by approximately $0.03 to both our low and high ranges.
Second, offsetting that decrease would be higher operating income associated with better revenue growth, higher investment income for the year, negated somewhat by a higher effective tax rate. We estimate the net impact to add approximately $0.02 on the low-end and $0.01 on the high-end.
Finally, the remaining $0.01 improvement to both our low and high end EPS guidance comes from our ongoing buyback activity. As with past practice, we do not intend to share the expected pace of our prospective buyback execution, and it could differ from our expectations embedded in the guidance. We expect unearned revenues to finish fiscal 2007 up 5% to 7%. Contracts not-billed should also finish 2007 up from where we exited fiscal 2006. In thinking about sequential changes in unearned revenue from quarter one to quarter two, we expect seasonality similar to last year, plus the addition of the 1.5 in revenue associated primarily with our technology guarantee programs.
For our full-year unearned revenue guidance, we're modeling a moderation in the recent annuity mix of our billings, as both Office 2007 and Windows Vista will be available to customers in the second half of the year.
As we think about our guidance for the rest of the year, many of the risks and opportunities I talked about last quarter still exist. Aside from our normal competitive, legal and general market risks, in particular, PC and server growth rates, we have our share of execution risks in the year. Our plan relies on execution on a number of important product launches starting in the second quarter and extending through the rest of the fiscal year. Customer acceptance of our new products is uncertain and, in particular, customer acceptance of our products such as Xbox 360 and Zune, are particularly difficult to predict during the holiday sales season. Also, the cost of acquiring and serving customers in our online business could increase.
Potential upside to our guidance in some cases is a mirror image of our risks. For example, customer acceptance and demand for Windows Vista, the Office 2007 system, Xbox 360 and Zune could exceed our expectations. Customer demand for our hardware products like Xbox 360 and Zune units with a fiscal revenue growth but not necessarily operating income growth. And finally, PC and server hardware shipments could grow faster than we anticipate.
Before moving to Q&A, then, I'd like to make a couple of quick comments. We continue to execute well against our strategy for delivering long-term shareholder value. We are committed, and continue to be, to growth through innovation. By investing in innovation across a broad array of high-growth markets, as well as in the development of a services capability to complement our current software offerings, we are positioning the Company to grow operating income faster than our technology peers over the long term.
With profitable growth, we generate significant operating cash flow, which enables two very important outcomes: First, it unleashes the virtuous cycle of reinvestment back into our business for further growth. Second, it allows us to advance our financial strategy of returning capital to shareholders. Overall we remain optimistic about our ability to innovate, to generate growth, and as a result of those, to create long-term shareholder value.
That wraps up my financial comments. I'd like to hand the call over to Colleen so we can get started with your questions.
Colleen Healy
Thanks, Chris. Let's now proceed to questions. We want to accommodate questions from as many people as possible, so please avoid multi-part questions and limit yourself to just one question. Operator, will you please repeat your instructions?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Heather Bellini - UBS.
Heather Bellini - UBS 
Hi, thank you. Good afternoon. I was wondering if you could give us an idea, what was the premium SKU mix for the first 12 months of the Windows XP launch? What's implicit in your guidance for Vista? As a follow-up, what do you view as negating factors of whether or not Client growth will be faster than PC shipment growth in calendar '07?
Chris Liddell 
Thanks very much. In terms of premium SKU mix, we're sticking with what Kevin Johnson told you at FAM, which is we're looking at 52% to 54%  I believe, is what he quoted for the year. That's this fiscal year, so we still feel good about that. Obviously it was higher than in the first quarter. But at this stage we're certainly comfortable with that number.
In terms of the calendar year growth, I think, which was the second half of your question, clearly, we are feeling good about growth in revenue in the Client area relative to PC units. So, in the first quarter and the second quarter, revenue growth will lag PC units. But then in the second half of the year, it's actually going to be at or above it, and equal to for the full year. So, we're looking at fiscal year '07, PC units growing at 8% to 10%, and Client revenue growing in fact slightly higher than that, 9% to 10%. That's a result of not only good unit shipments, obviously, but also the positive impacts of our commercial and retail part of the Client business.
In terms of XP and premium mix, I'll get one of my colleagues to grab that number. I don't have that at hand straightaway.
Operator
Your next question comes from Adam Holt - J.P. Morgan.
Adam Holt - J.P. Morgan 
Two questions on the cost structure for the second quarter. You mentioned that you're going to be able to get some improvements in the Xbox margins. I was wondering if that's coming from software attach or component pricing?
Secondly, as we look at the cost that shifted out of the first quarter, it looks like the operating margins, net the impact of the deferrals, were a little bit lower than I was looking for in Q2. Should we assume that entire amount falls in the second quarter, and then that's going to go in the marketing line? Thank you.
Chris Liddell 
Sure, Adam. In terms of the better margin for Xbox, it's both those impacts. So, we are seeing lower cost per console, we're coming down the manufacturing cost line, and in fact, we're doing better than what we had hoped for. So, last year we saw slightly higher costs to console than we were expecting; this year, certainly to date, we're experiencing better costs per console. We're sticking, clearly, with our view of being cost-neutral over the console life. This year is shaping up very well.
On top of that, we did also get good software attach. So, we saw software attach, I believe, over five for the quarter, which when you spread over the number of units that we sold, meant that our revenue per unit for software was very good in the quarter. We continue to be very pleased with that. Also from some of the other sources of revenue, they're not as significant, but, obviously, with the number of people that we're seeing on Xbox Live, we're starting to see some benefit from that. So, all of those are helping with the Xbox margins.
In terms of the second half of your question, which was on the operating costs, most of that marketing spend was a shift from quarter one to quarter two. So, you are correct; to the extent that we saved some revenue on OpEx, to a large extent you'll see that in the second quarter. As you'll see from our full year guidance, that's still intact. exactly the same from an overall OpEx point of view. So, there's some spread, I believe, in the third and fourth quarter, but it's primarily a quarter one to quarter two shift.
Operator
Your next question comes from Charles DiBona - Sanford Bernstein.
Charles DiBona - Sanford Bernstein 
Chris, you sound pretty upbeat about the online services group, even though the numbers seem to be going pretty much sideways. Could you give us some insight, other than the product launches, to some of the metrics that you're looking at that give you confidence that this is really headed in the right direction? Maybe it's conversion rates or share or the size of the advertising community, but something that underlies your confidence in that group.
Chris Liddell 
The revenue per search is, clearly, the one that we've got closest on our eye at the moment. We look at probably 10 to 12 metrics across that group fairly closely. But in terms of the revenue per search, that is going up sequentially as we get more advertisers onto the adCenter platform. We're close to now lapping where we were when we came off the Overture platform from last year.
So, with the revenue expectations that we have in the back half of the year, I am expecting us certainly in the U.S. anyway to equal or go above our revenue per search on a year-over-year basis, not just a quarter-over-quarter basis, and that will help drive revenue in the second half.
On the display advertising side, we obviously look at both the volume and the monetization there. Both those figures again, we look at the back half of the year and are expecting that to be pretty good, but from our point of view, those numbers are reasonable as well.
Operator
Your next question comes from Rick Sherlund - Goldman Sachs.
 Rick Sherlund - Goldman Sachs 
Chris, if I could take you back to the call you did a couple days ago on the change in accounting for the undelivered elements for Windows versus the Dynamics, where you're going to move to ratable recognition. I wasn't on that call; I was in the air, but I just wanted a chance to come back to that issue. If you could clarify that. So, for Dynamics, starting in the third quarter, we're going to shift to ratable recognition?
Chris Liddell 
No, it's in the first quarter for Dynamics.
 Rick Sherlund - Goldman Sachs 
First quarter of next year?
Chris Liddell 
No, the first quarter of this year. There's a full-year impact for this year. And then  obviously, only a couple quarters of impact on the Vista side.
 Rick Sherlund - Goldman Sachs 
I'm curious about how big that is, because I would think that the Windows change is bigger than the Dynamics change.
Chris Liddell 
In absolute terms going forward, in particular as you look forward to fiscal year '08, you'll be absolutely correct. In terms of fiscal year '07, because one is for a full year and the other is only for a part year as the product phases in, then they basically offset each other. 
As we look to fiscal year '08, you'll see a much more significant impact from the Vista change relative to the Dynamics, obviously, because of the scale of those businesses. When we give you guidance for next year, we will absolutely call that out and be transparent about it. Because as you know, it's purely an accounting change; it doesn't change the underlying economics. 
So, we will tell you exactly how much of the guidance for next year we anticipate with both of them. And you are right; it will be much more significant for Windows than it will be for Dynamics in fiscal year '08.
 Rick Sherlund - Goldman Sachs 
The reason for the change in Dynamics, should I anticipate that you're going to move to an on-demand, software-as-a-service model, where you can charge over time and you'd be relatively indifferent from a revenue recognition standpoint, whether it was on premise or on demand?
Chris Liddell 
Because it's more in the accounting area, let me just hand over to Frank and he'll give you the technical answer.
Frank Brod 
We have actually changed the way we are marketing the licenses there. In the past we've licensed on a per-module basis. Our new licensing program actually licenses on a per-seat basis. So with that, because all future software and upgrades and functionality are available to the new licensees, we will actually move to a ratable recognition rather than an up-front recognition.
Operator
Your next question comes from Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch.
Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch 
Just a quick clarification on the EPS guidance. So, the tender offer, the shortfall in the buyback on account of that is balanced by the investment income, right? Is that how you get to pretty much the same EPS guidance as before, or am I missing something? I just wanted to clarify that.
Chris Liddell 
There's three elements that help us get back. Two downward elements and three upward elements. One is the lower tender, we also have a slightly higher tax rate that we're anticipating for the year. So those, all other things being equal, would lower our EPS guidance for the year.
In terms of upward impacts which offset that, we are obviously continuing to buy back shares during the course of the year. We have a better investment income, as you mentioned. But also, we have got better operating income. So, we are guiding to higher revenue, and the benefits of that higher revenues are flowing through to operating income. So, I primarily call out better business performance, which is helping offset some of the lower earnings per share impacts of buyback.
Operator
Your next question comes from Brent Thill - Citigroup.
Brent Thill - Citigroup 
With the new stiff antipiracy features in Vista, are you assuming similar piracy as in past cycle, or are you expecting a slight improvement with the Vista launch?
Chris Liddell 
We're certainly looking at the back half of the fiscal year which is the only one at this stage, clearly, that we're guiding to, to OEM unit sales being higher than PC units as a result of our antipiracy. So, we're looking at, I believe, for the full year something like a 1% to 2% benefit as a result of that. So, we're not looking at significantly different rates relative to XP. Clearly, as we go into fiscal year '08 and onwards, we'll give you some guidance at that stage. But certainly it is helping, but we're already seeing some positive benefits from what we're doing on the XP side.
Brent Thill - Citigroup 
Okay. And the blended ASP, is that fair that  6% to 8% with Vista? Is that a fair rate, or do you think it's a little lower?
Chris Liddell 
I'm not sure where you're getting the 16% from, to be honest.
Brent Thill - Citigroup 
No, I'm sorry. 6% to 8%; would that be a fair blended ASP increase with Vista versus XP? Would that be a fair range to assume for an ASP lift?
Chris Liddell 
Look, obviously, we're giving or talking about the individual products. At this stage we're not talking about blended rates. We're talking about the premium mix that we expect. But we'll let the market determine what that's going to be in the second half of the year. We have some anticipation in the guidance we've given, but I don't want to comment on a specific number for ASP.
Operator
Your next question comes from Jason Maynard - Credit Suisse.
Jason Maynard - Credit Suisse 
Just a question about use of cash. There's a lot of acquisitions going on at fairly high prices in the online property space. I'm just curious,  what are your parameters around contemplating a transaction like that, and how you think about some of those larger deals? And also, just maybe as the flip-side of this is what are your plans for CapEx for this fiscal year, and have they changed at all since last quarter?
Chris Liddell 
We are very rigorous on the acquisition side. We bought 23 companies last year, and as Colleen mentioned in her statement, we bought four in the first quarter. But we have an incredibly disciplined process for acquisitions that go through a number of stages, and clearly they need to be ROI and economic value-positive. So, you are correct that we are seeing some price inflation in some of the acquisitions that we're talking about. For every one we do, we probably turn down one or two. So, we don't buy everything that we look at and we are selective on not only what we buy, but how much we pay for it.
In terms of our attitude going forward on acquisitions, I think we've said a number of times at financial analyst meetings and outside of that, we do see acquisitions playing a role in our growth. So, I would certainly expect us to still buy companies. In the first quarter it tended to be more in the Server and Tools area. Going forward it could well be in the online services area, in particularly with the speed of how that market is developing and some of the opportunities we're being shown, obviously that's a possibility. But we are not going to buy anything that we don't think creates economic value.
In terms of CapEx, it's very much in line with what we guided you to in July. So, we're looking at just over $2 billion for the year.  I believe we spent $400 million in the first quarter. In terms of online spend on CapEx, which is one of the areas people are primarily interested in, we're looking at around $700 million for the full year, and we spent about $150 million in the first quarter.
Operator
Your next question comes from John McPeake - Prudential.
John McPeake - Prudential 
Back on the undelivered elements, you're now going to be recognizing that revenue versus deferring it. Could you talk a little bit about the give and takes there, with the fact that Vista Enterprise in particular is only available to customers with some sort of an SA or an EA that covers Client, and historically they've been able to buy that from the OEMs?  I'm trying to get a sense as to how those two dynamics play out in the unearned over the course of the year.
Frank Brod 
Your question is about the undelivered elements and the enterprise agreements?
Chris Liddell 
In terms of enterprise agreements, we'll still, obviously, ratably spread enterprise agreement income over the life of the contract. So, that won't change. It will only be for the undelivered elements of sales through, in particular, OEMs of the Vista software, where  it's not delivered under a software assurance program; it's delivered under a sale of a PC. When we sell under the sale of a PC, those undelivered elements will not be deferred as they were in XP. So, it doesn't really influence the enterprise agreement recognition, if I'm understanding your question correctly.
John McPeake - Prudential 
That's correct. So, you've got about 15% that used to be deferred in the OEM agreements that's now being recognized. But you also have new SKUs that can only be purchased for the Client business. So, Vista Enterprise in particular, you need to have that covered by an SA. And that's a new thing for Microsoft, so I'm trying to get a sense as to whether that's going to have an incremental positive impact, potentially, over the course of the year to your unearned. So, you have a new SKU that is a Client SKU.
Colleen Healy
If more users find that particular SKU, which you can only get under an SA, very compelling, then yes, you would see more unearned. That's a big assumption to make. But certainly, the accounting there has not changed. To the extent that we see more business done through volume licensing, you would continue to expect to see that same impact on unearned and contracted not-billed.
Operator
Your next question comes from Peter Misek - Canaccord Adams.
Peter Misek - Canaccord Adams 
Just one quick question on other product cycles. We haven't heard an update recently on how the Longhorn server cycle appears to be progressing. Clearly, we're coming to the end of the Vista launch cycle. Can you provide us any update on that product cycle, please?
Chris Liddell 
That's still on track for the second half of next calendar year. So, no change for that.
Colleen Healy
Thanks so much. We probably have time for just one or two more questions.
Operator
Your next question comes from Kevin Buttigieg - A.G. Edwards.
Kevin Buttigieg - A.G. Edwards 
On the forecast for the Server and Tools unit revenue growth of 10% to 12%, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you see the impact of virtualization on that growth rate? Obviously, you have Microsoft Virtual Server, but perhaps offsetting that might be some lower unit sales of Windows Server. Could you just sort of help form the parameters around virtualization's impact on that business?
Colleen Healy
Our thinking around virtualization is that it's good for customers. We feel like our offerings address those well. The industry is going there, and that's reflected in the hardware server  numbers that you see from the Company. We feel like our pricing is very competitive, especially to other pricing out there; pretty easy to understand, pretty competitive. We think that we're well positioned there, and we welcome ushering it in, and we've got good products there.
Kevin Buttigieg - A.G. Edwards 
So, 10% to 12% seems like it sustainable, then, even in light of virtualization's adoption rate?
Colleen Healy
Today we're giving you second quarter fiscal year '07 guidance. But virtualization, we think, is a good thing for the industry. Just like with Moore's Law, getting more power out of your hardware is a good thing for the ecosystem. Great, thanks so much. Time for one last question, please.
Operator
Your next question comes from Laura Lederman - William Blair.
Laura Lederman - William Blair 
I have two quick questions. One is, can you give us an update on cash flow, what your expectations are for this year? And also, a phenomenal result for SQL Server. Can you talk about where you're particularly seeing strength in that product? Thank you.
Chris Liddell 
On the cash flow side, it will follow traditional patterns. Clearly, cash flows for the quarter and the second quarter are impacted to some extent by inventory builds for Xbox, but that will wash itself out through the system. So, when you look at our cash flow for the year, the only real elements of significance are probably slightly higher CapEx. But in the overall scheme of Microsoft, that's not huge. But spending just over $2 billion of CapEx will clearly be an impact on cash flow.
Our inventory and working capital should be broadly in line with historic patterns. And then the buyback is the last thing, which will depend to some extent on what we buy in the second half of the year. But other than that, cash flow trends will be typical from what you've seen in previous years. 
Laura Lederman - William Blair 
SQL Server was a great result. Where are you particularly seeing strength? Vertical markets, company size, applications? Just give us some context on why that growth rate is still so strong.
Colleen Healy
I'll take out one, Lauren. So, SQL strong really across the board, as evidenced by 30% growth, really means you do need to have some nice broad strength. We've been particularly delighted in the larger enterprises really looking to SQL for their critical applications. We continue to do well in the mid-size space as well. So, really it's been nice, broad strength there.
Laura Lederman - William Blair 
What about U.S. versus international?
Colleen Healy
Again, with nice 30% growth, you're going to see really good adoption, really, across the board. Thanks, Laura. And thank you, everyone, for your participation in today's call. If you have any further questions, please feel free to call me or my team directly.

Good afternoon and welcome to the Microsoft 2006 fiscal-year fourth-quarter earnings conference call. Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session of today's conference. Please be advised this call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. 
I would now like to turn the call over to Colleen Healy, General Manager, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Colleen Healy
Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 
This afternoon, I am joined by Chris Liddell, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Corporate Vice President of Finance and Administration, and Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel. 
Today's call will start with Chris providing some key takeaways for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 and an overview of expectations for fiscal year 2007. I will then provide details around our fourth quarter results and then turn it back to Chris for a more detailed discussion of our guidance for the full year and first quarter of fiscal 2007. After that, we will take your questions. 
Our earnings release includes an addendum of financial highlights, which contains more detailed information about revenue, operating expenses and other items. We have also posted our quarterly financial summary slide deck, which is intended to follow the flow of our remarks today in order to assist you. The slide deck offers highlights from the quarter, outlines our guidance, and provides reconciliations of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures that we will talk about today. 
You can find the earnings release, the financial highlights and the quarterly financial summary slide deck on the investor relations website at www.microsoft.com/msft. 
Today's call will be recorded. Please be aware that if you decide to ask a question, it will be included in both our live transmission, as well as any future use of the recording. As always, shareholders and analysts can listen to a live webcast of today's call at the Microsoft investor relations website. A replay of the call will be available at this same site through the close of business on July 20, 2007.

Actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release and the comments made during this conference call, and our 2005 Form 10-K, subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. 
With that, let me now turn it over to Chris. 
Chris Liddell
Thanks, Colleen, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to be with you today to share our results and talk with you about how we see fiscal 2007 shaping up. 
I will start today’s call with highlights from last year’s performance and then give you an overview of our expectations for next year. 
Let me remind you that we will discuss quarter 4 and fiscal year ’06 results on the reporting structure of seven operating segments, and we will provide fiscal year 2007 guidance under the new reporting structure of five segments. 
You heard directly from Frank Brod on Monday of this week, when we provided you with a preview of our new reporting structure. I would like to say that I am delighted that Frank has joined our team during the quarter as Chief Accounting Officer. He brings a wealth of knowledge to the team with his prior work experience, plus his participation in the standard-setting process at the FASB. 
Looking at results, fiscal year 2006 marked our return to double-digit revenue growth, with top-line growth coming within our guidance provided at our last financial analyst meeting. 
Revenue growth accelerated throughout the year, resulting in 11% growth over fiscal year 2005. 
Not only did we benefit from better-than-expected PC demand and an overall healthy tech economy, we also enjoyed strong customer acceptance of our newly launched products. 
Our Home and Entertainment, Server and Tools and Business Solutions groups, which all had launches during the year, turned in a combined 20% plus year-over-year revenue growth. 
The Home and Entertainment division made significant progress, and sold 5 million Xbox 360 consoles for the year. 
Second, our core businesses turned in an excellent performance with double-digit bookings growth in both the quarter and full year. Unearned revenue finished the year growing 19%, which is a tremendous performance. 
We saw broad-based strength from business customers for not only our core Windows, Office and server products, but also increased demand for communications products and services. 
Third, you will see the both Business Solutions and Mobile Embedded Devices exceeded our original revenue guidance for the year, and achieved operating profitability, which we forecast to be sustainable going forward. 
We are particularly pleased about hitting this missed milestone, given the change in our reporting structure, and I want to give credit in particular to the teams working on those businesses. 
Finally, we made substantial progress on our strategy of returning cash to shareholders during fiscal year 2006. We have purchased over $6 billion of shares since I last talked with you, and we closed the year returning over $23 billion of cash to shareholders through dividend and stock repurchases. 
I am very pleased to announce on the second anniversary of our $30 billion stock buyback plan that we have completed that program in half the time originally authorized. With that program now completed, our Board of Directors has authorized a $20 billion tender offer to be completed over 20 business days, starting tomorrow. They have also given authorization to repurchase up to an additional $20 billion of company stock at management's discretion. This latter authorization expires in June, 2011. 
Moving to fiscal 2007 guidance, the coming year brings the second major installment on our multi-year product cycles and a period of improving revenue growth for the company. 
Let me make a couple of key points about the year. 
First, we are expecting continued double-digit revenue growth. The launches of Windows Vista and Office 2007 will drive significant revenue growth in the second half of the year. Combine that with the seasonally strong entertainment and devices revenue around the holiday, and you will see a very strong revenue growth in Q2 and beyond. 
Second, growth in operating income in the first half of the year will lag revenue growth due to increasing mix of Xbox 360 console revenue and related costs, coupled with significant investments and preparations for the launches of our flagship products. 
This trend should reverse in the second half of the year, when we expect operating income will grow faster than revenues. 
Third, we are making some big investments in key areas of long-term growth. You are going to hear more from me today on these subjects, with additional color and detail at the financial analyst meeting next week, about how these investments will help drive future growth for the company. 
Fiscal 2007 is going to be an important and exciting year for us. We are very pleased with our expected top-line growth and we believe we are making the right investments for our future. In particular, our announced tender buyback combined with our expected revenue performance lays the groundwork for strong EPS growth in fiscal 2007, while still investing in innovations to drive future long-term growth. 
With those high-level themes for 2006 and 2007, I am going to turn the call over to Colleen now for some more details on how the 2006 fiscal year closed out. 
Colleen Healy
Thanks, Chris. In the interest of providing more time on today's call for Chris to discuss our fiscal year 2007 guidance, I am going to keep my remarks about our fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal 2006 performance brief. 
Overall, it was a strong finish to the year. 
Specifically, during the quarter:
I will now provide more detail on our financial performance, starting with revenue. I will discuss top-line financial and business momentum points and then follow-up with revenue performance for each of the business units. All growth comparisons I mention relate to the comparable quarter of last year unless otherwise specified. 
Revenue growth for the quarter was 16%. That is the fastest quarterly growth rate in over two years and the highest Q4 growth rate in seven years. Strong results in Home and Entertainment, Server and Tools, and the Client businesses were the primary drivers, accounting for 85% of the absolute revenue growth in the quarter. 
Overall, five of our seven business groups recorded double-digit growth rates. 
Revenue growth for the year was 11%, with quarterly growth rates accelerating throughout the year, driven by strong product launches such as SQL Server 2005, Xbox 360, Dynamics CRM 3.0, and Visual Studio 2005. 
Our core businesses of Client, Information Worker and Server and Tools performed well. Taken together, they achieved double-digit revenue growth and exceeded our expectations of a year ago. 
Healthy PC and server hardware market growth were key contributors to our results, both during the quarter and during the year. The PC market was stronger than we expected, with an estimated growth rate of approximately 11% to 12% in Q4. 
The consumer segment growth rate outpaced that of the business segment by a factor of two and all regions registered double-digit growth, with the exception of North America and Japan. 
Our mix of product billings continued to evolve this quarter, with approximately 30% from the OEMs, 40% from multi-year licensing agreements, 15% from license-only sales, and the balance from our other businesses. 
Relative to prior year, our mix continues to highlight a noticeable swing from license-only sales to multi-year licensing agreements in front of flagship product launches such as Windows Vista and Office 2007, scheduled for later this year. 
As a result, we had a very strong quarter overall from a volume licensing perspective, with strong renewals on enterprise agreements in particular. We estimate that EA renewal experience is trending to the high-end of our historical range of 66% to 75%. In addition, select and open annuity growth significantly outpaced non-annuity licensing. 
Our unearned revenue balance ended the quarter at a record $10.9 billion, up 19% over the same period in the prior year, and a record $2 billion increase over the prior quarter. 
Our contracted not-billed balance at the end of June was also sequentially higher, and continues to exceed $9 billion. 
If you consider our reported revenue and changes in the unearned and contracted not-billed balances, you will find that bookings growth exceeded 25% for the quarter, and over 10% for the full fiscal year. We believe these results are indicative of not only strong customer acceptance of our recently launched products, but more importantly the compelling value proposition and growing customer demand for our future products. 
I want to also point out that our revenue results for the quarter include about $180 million, or 2 percentage points of growth, resulting from a change in the billing methodology for OEM distributors in our system builder channel. We now bill and record revenue for all of our OEM distributors regardless of their size when the product is delivered to them. 
Now I would like to provide revenue highlights by business segment. 
Client revenue grew 12%, driven by OEM revenue growth of 13%. OEM revenue growth resulted from 19% license unit growth. The 6 percentage point difference between OEM license unit growth and revenue growth this quarter was caused primarily by growing volume in emerging markets and the relative strength of the consumer segment of the market. 
We were particularly pleased with growth of 6% in Client's commercial and retail licensing products, driven primarily by strong growth in multi-year contract agreements. 
This is the first quarter of growth for Client's commercial and retail licensing business since Q1 of fiscal 2005. 
Server and Tools delivered double-digit revenue growth for the 16th consecutive quarter --18% revenue growth in the quarter was driven by strong momentum from new product launches earlier in the year, including SQL Server, which grew over 35%. 
Windows server performance also remained strong, with net deployment growth consistent with overall X86 server market growth. 
Information Worker revenue grew 6% to $3.1 billion, driven by strong growth in multi-year contract agreements for Office and momentum in our real-time communications business. The shift to annuity offerings for Office accelerated this quarter, signaling strong customer demand for our upcoming Office 2007 product. As a result, unearned revenue for Information Worker was up 28% from the prior year. 
MBS revenue was up 16% from the prior year, resulting from continued strength in our Dynamics ERP products, as well as Dynamics CRM momentum. During the quarter, over 50,000 new Dynamics CRM users were added as the product grew rapidly across all segments, geographies and industry verticals. 
Strong revenue growth and efficiencies drove MBS operating profitability for both the quarter and for the first time ever, for the full year. 
MSN revenue was $580 million, and down 3% with flat advertising growth and a 13% decline in access revenue. 
Display revenue for the quarter grew in line with the market and we continue to make good progress in ramping our adCenter platform. Currently, we are servicing 100% of our U.S. search traffic on adCenter, along with traffic in select countries internationally. 
MED capped off a very strong year and its fifth consecutive quarter of revenue growth in excess of 40%. During fiscal 2006, license growth for Windows mobile-based phones was 90% and the division achieved operating profitability for the first time ever. 
Lastly, Home and Entertainment growth of 94% during the quarter was driven by strong performance across all of its businesses. Xbox grew over 125% as a result of 1.8 million Xbox 360 unit shipments during the quarter. 
With an installed base of 5 million consoles and growing, key profit drivers such as Xbox 360 software and accessory attach, remain very strong relative to previous console launches from competitors. 
Now for the rest of the income statement. 
While revenue increased 16% for the quarter and 11% for the year, cost of revenue increased 53% and 27% respectively, due primarily to Xbox 360 console volumes. As a result, gross margin relative to the prior year was down 4 percentage points for the quarter and 2 percentage points for fiscal 2006. 
Q4 operating expenses, other than cost of revenue, increase $414 million, or 8% excluding legal charges. 
Aside from cost of revenue, operating expenses excluding legal charges in fiscal 2006 increased 11%. 
Operating income for the quarter was $4.2 billion, excluding legal charges, up 13% or $487 million. If you set aside legal charges in the Home and Entertainment results, which were disproportionately impacted by negative margin console sales, operating margins in Q4 improved by 2 percentage points over the prior year. 
Looking at the full fiscal year, operating income was $17.6 billion, excluding legal charges, up 6% or $960 million from the prior year. Operating margins in fiscal 2006 were also negatively impacted by strong Xbox 360 console sales. 
If you normalize for legal charges and Home and Entertainment results, you will find that operating income grew slightly faster than revenue and operating margins were consistent with the prior year. 
Investment income and other totaled $317 million during the quarter, and our effective tax rate was 34% as a result of non-deductible legal charges. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter and the year, excluding non-recurring items, was 31%. 
Diluted shares outstanding were 10.3 billion for the quarter and 10.5 billion for the year, down 5% and 3% respectively from the prior year as a result of execution against our share repurchase program. 
Boiling it all down, earnings per share, excluding legal charges for the quarter, were $0.31. For the full year, we delivered earnings per share, excluding legal charges and tax benefits, of $1.27, which is in line with the guidance we provided to you a year ago. 
Chris will now provide you with our expectations for Q1 and fiscal year 2007. 
Chris Liddell
Thanks, Colleen. I am going to spend my remaining time on the call talking about what we see coming for the full year and the first quarter, and then close with my comments with some color on today's stock buyback announcement. 
Before we get into specific guidance, let me outline some of our key assumptions. 
The fiscal 2007 forecast assumes a broad continuation in the economic conditions and demand from where we exited in 2006, and our forecast does not include any significant impacts from foreign exchange movements. 
We expect PC unit demand to continue to remain healthy but to moderate from the growth rates we saw in 2006, particularly in our fiscal second quarter, ahead of the launch of Windows Vista. Specifically, we expect PC unit growth for fiscal 2007 to be 8% to 10% for the year and between 9% and 11% for the first quarter. We estimate that PC unit growth rates will be higher in consumer segments than in business segments, and higher in emerging markets than in mature markets. 
On the server hardware front, we estimate the total market should grow 10% to 12% for the year. 
Let me go through some detailed guidance. 
For the full year, we expect our revenue to come in between $49.7 billion to $50.7 billion, growing 12% to 14%. This is in line with the guidance we gave you in April and is actually a little better on dollar terms, given our stronger finish to fiscal year 2006. Our growth is driven by broad-based revenue growth across all of our five segments. 
For the first quarter, we expect revenue of $10.6 billion to $10.8 billion, which represents a growth rate of 9% to 11%. There are a couple items to note when you consider our first-quarter revenue: 
When thinking about the shape of the year, given the timing of our key product launches, you should expect revenue growth to be strong, beginning in the second quarter, driven in part by revenue growth from our Entertainment and Devices divisions. Furthermore, we expect an increase in the seasonality of our total expenses in the first half due to increased product costs associated with EDD console shipments. 
Revenue guidance in our recently announced five business units reporting structure is as follows: for Client, we expect full-year growth to be 8% to 10% and Q1 growth to be 5% to 6%. That guidance includes improvement in the commercial and retail portion of our business due to our launch of Windows Vista, targeted to go to businesses in November and consumers in January.
For the OEM portion of the business, we expect revenue to grow slower than the PC hardware market, due to increased concentration amongst larger OEMs, consumer hardware shipments growing faster than business shipments, and relatively faster growth in emerging markets.
Server and Tools revenue should grow 14% to 15% for the year and 12% to 14% for the first quarter. Coming off the impressive growth in last year, Server and Tools will continue to show double-digit growth throughout the year from the sustained momentum of SQL Server and Visual Studio, combined with growth in Windows Server, our security and management products, and enterprise services.
We forecast revenue in the Online Services group to grow between 7% and 11% for the year and be flat to down 4% in Q1. Growth in the first half of fiscal 2007 will be negatively impacted on a year-over-year comparison due to the transition to our adCenter platform in the U.S., and our upcoming transition to adCenter in the U.K. slated to begin in August. 
We are pleased with the non-financial results from adCenter, such as 100% of our U.S. search traffic running through the platform and the positive feedback from advertisers on the ROI of their advertising programs.
Microsoft Business division revenue should grow 9% to 10% for the year, and about 3% to 5% for the first quarter. Revenue growth in Q1 will be tempered by customers' preference to purchase annuity contracts, as well as a decrease in the rate of license-only purchases in front of the launch of Office 2007, expected later in the calendar year. 
We are expecting strong revenue growth in the second half of the fiscal year. We feel that our customers' continued preference to purchase annuity contracts indicates their excitement about Office 2007. We also expect continued strong demand from our Dynamics products, building upon the momentum in fiscal 2006. 
For the Entertainment and Devices Division, we are forecasting another strong year with full-year revenue growth of 31% to 46%, and first-quarter growth of 53% to 60%. The yearly guidance implies by the end of the fiscal year we will have sold 13 million to 15 million Xbox 360 consoles since launch. 
The EDD team is carrying good momentum into fiscal year ‘07 and growth will benefit from holiday sales of Xbox 360, increased commercial rollouts of IPTV, and continued introductions of devices running Windows Mobile 5.0 with Direct Push technology. 
Operating income for the year is expected to be between $18.9 billion and $19.4 billion, growing at 8% to 10%, excluding legal charges. For the quarter, we expect operating income to be between $4.0 billion and $4.2 billion. 
Quarter 1 operating income includes the impact of a higher overall mix of lower-margin revenues for Xbox 360, increased costs associated with the Online Services group, as well as operating costs in preparation for the launch of Windows Vista and Office 2007. 
On today's call, with our planning process now complete, I would like to give you some additional color and guidance on expenses that we do not usually give in our earnings call. We do not expect to give this level of detail going forward, but know there is a lot of interest in the area for next year. 
Because of our evolving mix of businesses and given the wide range of COGS estimates in the financial community, I want to provide you with some guidance here on how we think about it going into our fiscal year. 
Cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue should increase between 1 to 2 points for the year, and should be up 3 points in Q1, resulting from an increase in the number of Xbox 360 consoles we will sell, additional costs associated with infrastructure and content costs in our Online Services group, and support and packaging costs for the retail launches of Windows Vista and Office 2007. 
Also, as we discussed in our third-quarter earnings call, we will be increasing our operating expenses to fund a variety of investments and activities in fiscal 2007. I would like to provide additional color on the size of that spending today and you will hear more about the strategic nature of these investments next week at our financial analyst meeting. 
On our last earnings call, you will recall that I categorized our spending into four general areas, which were the following: 
In regard to the first group, Xbox products costs, we have now given you guidance on the number of units we are forecasting to sell by the end of fiscal year and have provided company-wide growth estimates for our cost of revenue, which was expressed as a percentage of revenue. This information should help you quantify the impact of Xbox. 
The second group, marketing and field sales costs, contains two distinct pools of spend. The first pool is what I consider launch costs, and totals approximately $450 million of increased spending in fiscal year ‘07 over fiscal year ‘06. That is the amount we will spend in various areas, such as creating awareness for Office 2007, Windows Vista and marketing for Xbox during the holidays. 
The second pool contains investments we will make in our sales force to ensure we have the appropriate level of resources to successfully execute in taking all of our new products to market and serve customers. The second pool represents roughly $450 million. 
Combined, this marketing and field sales category is in the range of a $900 million investment next year. The total increase in spending also reflects general increases in salaries and costs in that area, and will help us deliver our record $5 billion to $6 billion sale increase forecasted for the coming fiscal year. 
The third group is developing either current high-growth products or developing new products and services to lay the groundwork for future growth. This group includes both announced products, such as our efforts in unified communications, mobility, business intelligence, security, high-performance computing, web servers, management, IPTV and also unannounced products and services that we believe are likely during the year. It also includes spending on our long-term research efforts. 
This is by far the largest amount of incremental investment for the company in fiscal year ‘07 compared to fiscal year ‘06, and totals approximately $1 billion across all of our business groups and corporate research staff. 
Our $1 billion consists of $200 million to $300 million in each of the following four groups: MBD, Server and Tools, EDD, and our Corporate Research group. These efforts in general are much longer-term and therefore drive modest amounts of revenue in the coming fiscal year. 
The fourth and final group of expenses is the incremental amount we will be spending on our services strategy. We intend to grow operating expenses in total in this area by approximately $500 million in fiscal year ‘07. This will be spread across developing and acquiring content to fuel our display advertising, continuing to build out and improve our search offerings and ad platforms, and funding increases in our infrastructure for data centers and equipment. 
The return on this spend is to some extent in fiscal year 2007, but also further out to support our MSN and large strategies. This group also includes spending on our Office Live and CRM Live products. 
All told, adding up these four buckets should amount to approximately $2.4 billion of incremental investments in fiscal year ‘07. As you can see by our guidance, total operating expenses excluding cost of goods sold are growing by about $2.7 billion and that maps to the presentations by company management to investors during the quarter, adjusted for our assumptions around foreign exchange rates. 
The remaining $300 million of operating cost growth is largely due to general increases in costs and unallocated acquisition amounts that we may do during the year. These acquisitions generally have a high year one accounting cost. 
Diluted earnings per share for the year are expected to come in at $1.43 to $1.47, and $0.30 to $0.32 for the first quarter. These numbers assume the full completion of our announced tender offer, which we estimate will have an impact of between $0.05 to $0.06 for the full fiscal year, and $0.01 in quarter 1. 
These earnings also assume an effective tax rate of 30.5%. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we expect unearned revenue to finish fiscal 2007 up 4% to 6%. Contracted not-billed should also finish 2007 up from current levels. When thinking about sequential changes in unearned revenue from the fourth quarter of fiscal year ‘06 to the first quarter of fiscal year ‘07, we expect the sequential decrease to be significantly greater than what you have seen in the last two years. 
This decline will be due to the absolute size of our fiscal fourth quarter annuity billings, relative to what we are projecting for quarter 1, as well as the relatively small amount of contract value that is up for renewal. 
Also, when looking at our full-year unearned revenue guidance, we are modeling a moderation in the recent annuity mix of our billings as both Office 2007 and Windows Vista will be available to customers in the second half of the year. 
I am asked by investors about areas of upside opportunities and downside risks to our guidance. Aside from our normal competitive, legal and general market risks -- in particular PC and server growth rates -- we have our share of execution risks in the next year. 
Our plan relies on execution on product launches and our ability to connect with customers once the products are in the market. 
There is also uncertainty around timing, supply and consumer response to upcoming game console launches by major competitors. 
Finally, as management has stated previously, the cost of acquiring and serving customers in our online businesses could increase. 
Specifically in terms of EPS guidance, our guidance assumes successful completion of the announced tender, with the resulting reduction in shares more than offsetting the loss of investment income from the cash used in the tender. 
Some potential upside to our guidance includes:
Before moving to the Q&A, I would like to make a couple of comments regarding the specifics of the share repurchase plan we announced today.  
The first component of today's buyback announcement is a $20 billion tender offer that, assuming it is fully completed inside the tender range, will reduce our outstanding share count by approximately 8%.  The period for people to tender their shares will begin tomorrow, July 21st, and is scheduled to expire on or about August 17th of this year. The tender offer is priced between $22.50 and $24.75 per share. 
Our executive officers and directors have advised that they will not be tendering any shares.
The second component of the announcement is an authorization for a $20 billion stock repurchase plan to be completed at a pace and size to be decided upon by management, and with an authorization expiry date of June, [2011]. 
I would like to reemphasize the amount that we purchased under this program could vary throughout the term of the plan and there is likely to be quarters where we have little or no activity against it. 
It is also important to note that this is simply an authorization, not a commitment. We will always report our activity of any quarterly [arrears], but I do not intend to comment on any potential forecast activity. 
So to wrap up, the fourth quarter served as a strong close to what turned out to be a good year. Full year revenue growth of accelerated to double-digits, gaining momentum throughout the year, helped by customer acceptance of our newly launched products and continued robust PC and server hardware sales. 
2007 is shaping up well. We are looking to generate another year of double-digit revenue and EPS growth as we deliver new releases of our two flagships products, Windows Vista and Office 2007, and build upon the momentum in Server and Tools and Entertainment and Devices. 
We will make significant investments in a variety of areas to build the next wave of growth for the company, and we will continue to execute on a strategy of returning cash to shareholders. 
That wraps up my financial comments. I am looking forward to catching up with a number of you next week at our financial analyst meeting. You will hear then from our business leaders and receive further insight on the topics we have discussed today, and our thoughts for 2007 and beyond. 
So we have some time for questions. I will hand the call over to Colleen so we can get started, and thank you. 
Question-and-Answer Session
Colleen Healy
Great. Let’s now proceed to questions. We want to accommodate questions from as many people as possible, so please avoid multi-part questions and limit yourself to just one question. 
Operator, will you please repeat your instructions?
Operator
Thank you. 
(Operator Instructions)
Our first question comes from Heather Bellini with UBS.
Heather Bellini - UBS
Great, thank you, good afternoon. I was wondering, Chris, if you could give us an idea what Vista release assumptions are embedded into your guidance for fiscal year ‘07 in terms of timing? Then I just have a follow-up to that, if possible. 
Chris Liddell
Sure, Heather. Embedded in that in Vista is the November release to business and January to consumers. On the Office side, by the end of the year for business and the beginning of next year for consumers, so it is the same base case as we have previously talked about.
Heather Bellini - UBS
Okay, and I guess the granularity that I was looking for is if so many people are moving to annuity agreements as a result of Vista, as evidenced by your strong bookings growth this quarter, even if it did slip from the January consumer release out for let's just say a month or two, would it really impact your guidance that much, given that the enterprise customers have basically paid you already and you are just recognizing that revenue on a systematic basis? 
Chris Liddell
Yes, that is a good observation and you are correct. There will be a relatively modest impact. There will obviously be some FTP sales that we would lose if it was to be deferred. 
To give you a sense of order of magnitude, and obviously this depends on the shape of the year as much as anything else, but if we were to see a slip let's say of a quarter, to give you a financial magnitude, we think that would have an impact of around $200 million to $400 million. 
Obviously, revenue that we would like to see but not significant in the overall guidance. 
Heather Bellini - UBS
Okay, great. I appreciate it. Thank you. 
Colleen Healy
Thanks, Heather. Next question, please. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch. 
Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch
Thank you very much. Just a couple of questions. One, if you could just talk about when you expect to actually do your launch-related spending? In other words, Bill Gates I think was mentioned in the press talking about an 80% probability of release of Vista on time in January. I am wondering how you are going to be timing the actual launch activities surrounding what still seems to be sort of a moving target. 
Secondly, if you could give us a little bit more color on how this Dutch auction process will actually work mechanically? Not to expect too much on it, but if you could just give us a little more bit more color on how you can accomplish the range of $22.50, $24.70, that will be useful perspective as well. Thank you. 
Chris Liddell
In terms of spending, obviously we will time that around the launch date. As we get more and more closer to that and more certain of that, we will start to work that in. We have embedded some plans already and that is characterized inside not only our first-quarter guidance but for the year overall. 
Some of the decisions, we will wait until we have the absolute date locked in. At this stage, we have some flexibility around that. At this stage, it is not going to be a significant difference in [pattern] of spending, but as when we lock the date in we will certainly press the button on the total spending overall. 
In terms of the Dutch auction, just to go back to basics, it will open tomorrow and close on August 17th, as I mentioned. People will be able to sell or offer to sell shares inside the range that we have bid during that period. 
In essence, they will be able to offer a certain number of shares at price points inside the range. So X shares at Y price, X plus Z at Y, at different price points. So we will have a schedule of prices at which people are willing to sell shares. We will add up the aggregate of all of those offers and strike a price which clears the market. 
The price at which we can buy $20 billion of value of shares, that price is the price that we will pay to everyone who has bid whether they have bid below that or not. We will play the clearing price then to all successful sellers. 
It is like an auction system. It is a Dutch auction in the sense that people will bid at different price points against us, and then we will take a clearing price on the market inside the range. 
Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch
So the clearing price ought to be somewhere between that range you are talking about? In a best case scenario, it would be $24.70, but maybe not exactly at that level? 
Chris Liddell
There are $0.10 increments inside the range. It clearly could obviously be at the absolute bottom or the absolute top of the range. It does not have to be inside the range. It could be inside or equal to the range limits. 
Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch
Great, thank you. 
Colleen Healy
Thanks, Kash. Next question, please. Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Sherlund with Goldman Sachs. 
Rick Sherlund - Goldman Sachs
Thank you. Just to follow up on Kash's comment, for clarification, you would expect one date where you will have a clearing price, so there is only one date within that range where the transaction will take place? 
Chris Liddell
Yes, that is correct. That is the last day. Up until that time, people can offer to tender but we will not strike the price until the very last day, by which time all offers to sell will be collected. We strike it on, if you like, the last minute of the last day. Any offers made before that will just simply be aggregated into that timing. 
Rick Sherlund - Goldman Sachs
Will there be an advantage to offering earlier, or would you sense that people would wait until the last couple of days to submit their offers? 
Chris Liddell
Well, there is no advantage from a seller's point of view because we are not legally able to buy early. We are constrained by the rules of tender, which we are obviously following totally. People can logistically get some advantage, if they want to but it is entirely up to them. We do not want to influence behavior at all. We just want to stick inside the rules but the rules specify that we cannot accept offers until the final. 
Rick Sherlund - Goldman Sachs
Okay. On the Online Services group, the guidance for the year was revenue growth of 7% to 11%, which looks pretty encouraging. I am wondering if you can offer any insight into how much of this is coming from Windows Live, MSN? 
Are you assuming that MSN, when adCenter begins to gain traction, I wonder if you can just give us a little more granularity on what is behind those numbers? 
Chris Liddell
From a revenue growth point of view, Windows Live is not a significant contributor in fiscal year ‘07. It obviously helps to drive some traffic but we are not seeing that has a big increment in this year. That is an investment in future years. 
adCenter will certainly help. What you have year over year is quite different shapes, so we came out of last fiscal year with our revenue for search effectively going down as we moved off, over to and onto adCenter, through the shape of this year, we are now fully on adCenter in the U.S., and as we start to get better comparables as we go through the year, you will see much better quarter-on-quarter comparison. As we scale up adCenter, it will also help, clearly. 
During the course of the year you will see an improvement and that is certainly embedded in the numbers that you see. Also, obviously the Access business is still decreasing, but it is becoming less significant in terms of the decrease. 
We are looking forward to a good continued year on the display side and a transition year on the search side. 
Colleen Healy
Thanks a lot, Rick. Next question, please. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Charlie DiBona with Sanford Bernstein. 
Charlie DiBona - Sanford Bernstein
I would actually like to follow up on Rick's question here around MSN, because if we look at that guidance, how should we evaluate adCenter? When can we start to see you start to turn the corner and at least track towards the overall search ad market here? We would expect obviously access to be declining and display to be sort of in line with the market. Just those two things could get you to the guidance you have here. 
Could you give us some more granularity on how we can evaluate your progress with adCenter? 
Chris Liddell
Yes, I think there is two ways, Charlie. One is, if you like, qualitative and through the year, we will share as much visibility as we can. I know Kevin and Ray are certainly intending to talk about it next week, just about some of the kind of qualitative metrics as we transition adCenter. The number of advertisers on us, for example, the general level of acceptance. That will give you some leading indicators of how we see the health of it. 
In terms of lagging indicators, the bottom line, you will be able to see our overall revenue growth. You will obviously be able to make some assumptions about what is happening on the display side because generally speaking, we are tracking in line with markets there. 
The access will be progressively less of a factor, so the delta will be the search side and you will be able to see, as the year goes on, on a quarter-by-quarter basis when you compare it both sequentially and also to the previous quarter, you will be able to see some of the adCenter impact directly from a financial output point of view. 
Colleen Healy
Thanks, Charlie. Next question, please. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Holt with JP Morgan. 
Adam Holt - JP Morgan
Good afternoon. My question is about the detail on the expenses for fiscal ‘07, which was very helpful. 
Historically, you said that some of the Xbox ramp expenses are effectively going to be one-time in nature. Presumably, some of the marketing and launch-related costs for Vista and Office are also going to be one-time oriented. 
As you think about the long-term spending profile for the company, if you could detail what you view as sort of a moment-in-time set of expenses versus what we should expect to see on an ongoing basis? 
Chris Liddell
We have tried to give you visibility in that by talking about launch spending -- launch and marketing spending as a category. I will not describe it as entirely one-off because there are other launches that happen year by year, but we bracketed that, and that is the $450 million. 
In terms of Vista, Office 2007 and Xbox launch-related spending, that is in the category of 450, so that gives you some visibility as to, on a year-by-year basis, what you might consider as one-off. 
In terms of the other areas of spending, they are more ongoing in nature. Clearly in some of the businesses, we are building the business up so it is not necessarily continuous at that level. 
But they are not, if you like, one-off in nature, in particular when we are hiring R&D and salespeople who are continuous there afterwards. 
Adam Holt - JP Morgan
If I could ask a follow-up on the bookings strength in the quarter, you noted that renewal rates were tracking towards the high-end of historical levels. Does that imply that renewals were primarily behind the strength in unearned in the quarter, or did you also see an up-tick in new customer billings? Thank you. 
Chris Liddell
It was a bit of both. Certainly the renewals was very strong, as you point out, and that was -- I think that was the majority of it, but also we saw good acceptance on the new side as well. 
The field did a fabulous job in the fourth quarter and really got out there. They had some visibility and some good products to sell and they took the opportunity to do a great job, both with existing and new customers. 
Adam Holt - JP Morgan
Thank you very much. 
Colleen Healy
Thanks, Adam. Next question, please. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Maynard with Credit Suisse. 
Jason Maynard - Credit Suisse
Good afternoon. I had one follow-up question on spending for FY07. I wanted to get a little bit more color on what your expectations are around for cap-ex. Specifically, over a couple-year period, should we see a material change in terms of how you look at cap-ex as you build out data center infrastructure for a lot of your online services? 
Chris Liddell
Yes, cap-ex is going up, and we certainly talked about that externally. We will see an increase year over year of around $600 million to $700 million on cap-ex, but that covering cap-ex of all nature, so it is not only in the MSN area, which is probably the one that people are most interested in. It is also general facilities cap-ex. 
In the MSN area, year on year we are probably looking at an increase, depending on some of the decisions we are going to make, around $200 million to $300 million year on year. 
That is building the infrastructure that we believe is necessary for the future of the business, so we will be building capacity that we not only need next year but also starting to build capacity for future years there afterward, as well. 
Jason Maynard - Credit Suisse
I have one quick follow-up on Server and Tools, just to try to get a little bit more color around your expectations for Windows Server growth. Specifically, any commentary you are seeing about growth rates relative to the Linux growth rate opportunity as well.
Chris Liddell
We are happy with the trends there. As I mentioned, we have grown, broadly speaking, in line with the market. We now have a product that can compete in the high-performance area so we think that is a good opportunity. 
Some of the spending we are looking at, some of the incremental spending that I bucketed into the growing and new areas, is targeted at the Windows Server area, in particular in some of the markets where Linux is strong. 
You are not necessarily going to see a benefit from that in fiscal year ‘07 for the reasons we talked about, but certainly that is an area where we think there is a fabulous opportunity for us and it is hence one of the reasons why we are investing in it. 
Jason Maynard - Credit Suisse
Thank you. 
Colleen Healy
Thank you. We may have time just for one or two other questions. Next question, please, Operator. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities. 
Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities
I was wondering, Chris, if you could give us any kind of breakdown in terms of your Client -- for guidance achieving -- on the benefits from China, particularly with Acer and Lenovo now standardizing on the Microsoft products. 
Chris Liddell
We saw good growth in OEM units relative to PC units in the quarter, and we are predicting that general trend is not necessarily to be as strong as it is out of the quarter, but going forward. 
It is too early to really say there is a substantial difference as a result of those contracts but our efforts aimed at anti-piracy generally we believe adds let's say 1 to 2 percentage points on our year-by-year basis -- it might move around in the quarter -- between OEM units and PC units. 
Clearly the price point for some of those sales is lower so it does drag down our average price, but in terms of our growth rate, it generally helps by about 1% to 2%. 
Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities
Great, thank you. 
Colleen Healy
Great, thanks. Next question, please, Operator. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Citigroup. 
Brent Thill - Citigroup
Good afternoon. Regarding MSN, how should we think about the return to profitability? Is that more of a ‘08 timeframe? 
If you could also just follow up regarding adCenter. You mentioned it is online now in the U.S. The rest of the world, your timing on when you expect that initiative will be fully up? 
Chris Liddell
In terms of MSN, it is full-on the U.S. It is in the U.K. in August. It is in France now. It is in Singapore now. We are not giving a particular schedule for when we will be 100% in the year but clearly it is in our line of sight. 
It is not far off that we are going to have 100% of our business anyway on adCenter. 
What was the other half of your question? Sorry.
Brent Thill - Citigroup
Regarding profitability in MSN. 
Chris Liddell
Profitability, yes. We have said, as I said in the previous quarter, that we do not expect MSN to be profitable in this fiscal year. By definition, therefore, it is later out than that. 
Based on the revenue guidance that we have given and some of the expense guidance that we have given, I imagine people will be able to get some shape of what we are looking at. 
We see for MSN that fiscal year ‘07 will be an investment year. 
Brent Thill - Citigroup
Thank you. 
Colleen Healy
Thank you. We have time for one last question please, Operator. 
Operator
Thank you. Our final question comes from Laura Lederman with William Blair. 
Laura Lederman - William Blair
Saved by the bell. Real quickly, can you talk about SQL Server growth? Is that going to be in line with the Server and Tools growth, or higher? You have done so great in the database market for several years. 
Also, when you talk about the 50,000 new users for CRM, could you talk about how much of that was hosted in the quarter versus how much was on premise? Thank you. 
Chris Liddell
On the SQL Server side, we are looking at 35% growth. It has been extremely successful and is growing faster than the Server and Tools business overall. 
I am not sure I want to put a number out for what that will look like going forward but embedded inside our guidance is what we consider to be very good growth. We still think from a price point of view, a quality point of view, it is a great product relative to its competitors -- all the reason why we have been able to achieve market share growth in the past. There is no reason to assume they are not going to continue in the future. 
Colleen Healy
Laura, could you repeat your hosted question? We just did not hear it. Laura Lederman - William Blair
Sure. The 50,000 new users added for the CRM last quarter, can you give us a sense how much of that was hosted, how much of that was on premise? What is going on there in the mix? 
Colleen Healy
Yes, we are delighted with that figure, even stacking against competitors. It is a nice volume for us. It is good momentum. It really does represent the choices that we are giving customers, Laura. 
It is not just hosted. It is not just a license from Microsoft. As you know, currently you can buy a license from Microsoft, host it yourself. You can go to our partners -- they will host it for you. The 50,000 is inclusive of both of those. 
We are looking forward to being able to offer additional choice to consumers by hosting ourselves, really starting second quarter of calendar year 2007. 
Laura Lederman - William Blair
Final question, if you look at the Business division growth of 9% to 10% for ‘07, can you talk a little bit about what you see driving that, and the components as well? Just a little bit of granularity.
Chris Liddell
Sure, that is for the division overall. Obviously with Office 2007 coming along, that is a big driver, although that is more of the second half of the year. Also, as we see some of these enterprise agreements that we are signing flowing through the accounts, that will certainly help. Growth in the CRM and ERP products, so the old MBD segment will continue to grow very strongly and that will help the overall division as well. 
In particular in the second half of the year, but general strength across all of those areas. 
Laura Lederman - William Blair
Thank you. 
Colleen Healy
Great. 
Chris Liddell
We are going to have to cut off now, but I appreciate all of your questions. I will hand it back to Colleen. Look forward to seeing a number of you in a week's time.

Good afternoon, and welcome to the Microsoft 2006 fiscal year third quarter earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions)  I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Colleen Healy, General Manager, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Colleen Healy
Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This afternoon, I'm joined by Chris Liddell, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel. Today's call will start with Chris providing some key takeaways for the third quarter of fiscal year 2006 and an overview of expectations for Q4. I will then provide detail around our third quarter results and then turn it back to Chris for a more detailed discussion of our guidance for the fourth quarter and a preliminary look at our current expectations for fiscal year '07. After that, we will take your questions.
We filed our 10-Q today in conjunction with our earnings release. Therefore, you have available the earnings release, MD&A, financial statements and footnotes. We have also posted our quarterly financial summary slide deck, which is intended to follow the flow of our prepared remarks in order to assist you. The slide deck offers highlights from the quarter, outlines our guidance and provides a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures that we will talk about today. You can find the earnings release, the 10-Q and the quarterly financial summary slide deck on the investor relations website at www.microsoft.com/msft.
Today's call is being recorded. Please be aware that if you decide to ask a question, it will be included in both our live transmission as well as any future use of the recording. As always, shareholders and analysts can listen to a live webcast of today's call at the Microsoft investor relations website.

With that, please flip to slide 4, where Chris will begin his comments. Chris. 
Chris Liddell
 Thanks, Colleen and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the time to join us for today's call. I'm going to begin with the key points from our third quarter's performance and then take a look at quarter four and fiscal 2007. During the quarter, revenue growth accelerated to 13% from 9% in quarter two and 6% in quarter one. We had good market momentum of recently launched products, which remained strong, and we continued our execution on returning cash to shareholders.
Our operating income was, however, lower than we had guided in the quarter, which can be attributed in the following order to: 
We continue to be pleased with the performance of our businesses, particularly in driving revenue. Revenue growth for our core businesses of Client, Information Worker and Server & Tools grew a combined 9% year-over-year for the quarter. We continue to see strong corporate demand and strength in PC and server hardware unit shipments.
Revenue growth of 29% in the business groups that have had recent product launches demonstrates our ability to choose the right places to focus our innovation efforts and make investments. Some specific examples are SQL Server, which continues to post impressive year-over-year growth rates. Its quarter three revenue growth, in excess of 30%, drove Server & Tools to its highest quarterly revenue growth rate for the year. 
Also, Home & Entertainment, Mobile & Embedded & Business Solutions all had good sales quarters. Combined, they posted over $0.5 billion of absolute revenue growth over the prior-year period, which equates to 68% growth. In the quarter, we also made significant strides in ramping up the supply of Xbox 360 consoles.
We also continued our momentum on returning cash to shareholders, purchasing $4.9 billion worth of our stock, which brings us just over $15.5 billion of stock repurchases this fiscal year. 
Now, I would like to make a few points about how the fiscal fourth quarter is shaping up. First, we continue to expect strong double-digit revenue growth, driven by sustained momentum across all of our businesses. Q4 is usually a seasonally good quarter for revenue in our Information Worker, Server & Tools and Business Solutions groups, and we expect that trend to continue. We also expect increasing growth from Home & Entertainment with the improving supply of Xbox 360 consoles.
Second, we will continue to accelerate the rate at which we invest in our business. Since we provided guidance three months ago, we have completed our senior-level strategy reviews and reassessed the strength of customer demand for our existing and potential new products. We see an increasing set of opportunities and, admittedly, challenges. We're going to target them with investments that leverage our ability to win.
As I mentioned on the last call, we're investing in our core businesses of Client, Information Worker and Server & Tools to prepare for the most significant wave of product launches in a decade. 
We are aggressively investing in MSN to continue to meet the competitive challenges we see and develop and deploy a world-class set of online services, and we are quickening the pace of development in a number of high-growth new business areas. I will discuss these investments later in the call.
With that overview, I would like to turn the call over to Colleen for more details on the quarter, and then I will provide you with more details on our fourth quarter and a preliminary outlook for fiscal year 2007.
Colleen Healy
 Thanks, Chris. As Chris mentioned, the accelerating revenue growth thus far in fiscal year '06 resulted in 13% growth during the quarter, which was driven by customer demand for our new products as well as healthy PC and server hardware sales. Specifically during the quarter, revenue was $10.9 billion, consistent with guidance entering the quarter. Operating income was $3.9 billion, which includes $397 million of legal charges and was lower than our guidance. Earnings per share were $0.29, which includes $0.03 for legal charges. And we returned over $5.8 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends.
I will highlight drivers of the strong revenue performance during the quarter, as well as outline the areas of incremental costs and investments. I will start by discussing top line financial and business momentum points, and I will follow up with revenue performance for each of the business groups. Then I will discuss operating expenses, and I will wrap up with an overview of operating income performance, as well as balance sheet and cash flow information. All growth comparisons I mention relate to the comparable quarter of last year, unless otherwise specified.
Revenue growth this quarter was driven by strong business and consumer market momentum for our new products. Server & Tools had yet another outstanding quarter, growing over 16%. Home & Entertainment grew 85% as Xbox sales more than doubled. MED and MBS grew 46% and 21%, respectively, on robust demand for our Windows Mobile and Microsoft Dynamics product lines. 
Taken together, these four businesses grew revenue 29% and delivered roughly 75% of our absolute revenue growth for the quarter. We were also very pleased with the continued strength in PC shipments for the quarter, which resulted in Client revenue growth of 8%.
The IT spending environment was largely in line with our expectations. As mentioned, PC hardware and server market growth remains robust. Demand was generally healthy across all customer segments, and from a regional perspective, EMEA and emerging markets continue to be relatively strong. 
We estimate PC market growth during the quarter at 12% to 13%, which was in line with our expectations three months ago. Consistent with the past several quarters, consumer PC shipment growth outpaced business shipments, and emerging market growth continued to significantly outpaced mature markets. PC unit demand was broad-based regionally, with double-digit growth rates in all geographies except for North America and Japan.
Our mix of product billings for the quarter was around 35% for OEMs, 27% for multi-year licensing agreements, 20% from license-only sales and the balance from our other businesses. This mix is different from the prior year, as a result of strong growth in our Home & Entertainment business and a shift from license only to multi-year licensing agreements. 
We had good results overall from a volume licensing perspective, with strong renewals on enterprise agreements. In addition, select and open annuity results for the quarter were very strong relative to non-annuity licensing.
As a result of these robust annuity licensing results, our unearned revenue balance ended the quarter at $8.9 billion, which was a little higher than we had anticipated, and up 12% over the same period in prior year. Our contracted not billed balance at the end of March was lower sequentially and continued to exceed $9 billion. Taking into account our reported revenue and changes in the unearned and contracted not billed balances, you will find that our bookings growth for the quarter approached 15% overall and in excess of 10% for our core businesses of Client, Information Worker and Server & Tools.
Now, let's work our way through the P&L. Revenue growth for the quarter was negatively impacted by 1 percentage point due to foreign exchange rates. Breaking this down by business segment, Client revenue grew 8%, driven by OEM revenue growth of 10%, offset by a 6% decline in commercial and retail licensing. 
The OEM revenue growth resulted from 16% license unit growth. As you have seen in previous quarters, the difference between OEM license unit growth and revenue growth is caused primarily by three factors:
Consistent with the relative strength in the consumer segment of the market and the growing momentum behind Windows Media Center, we continue to see a change within the sales mix of our Premium Edition operating system licensed to OEMs. While OEM premium mix of 53% was up 4 percentage points from the prior year, a larger percentage of Premium Edition sales were made to consumers purchasing Windows Media Center, which carries a lower price relative to Windows Professional.
During the quarter, we made strides against piracy, as the pace of Windows unit sales outpaced the overall PC hardware market. The Company also recently signed a number of agreements to promote the use of Microsoft-licensed software with four of the leading PC OEMs serving the Chinese market. 
Server & Tools delivered double-digit revenue growth for the 15th consecutive quarter, as the Windows server system enjoyed broad adoption. SQL Server is a hit with businesses, growing in excess of 30% this quarter. SQL Server revenue growth continues to dramatically outpace offerings from competitors in the database market. The value proposition SQL Server 2005 offers to businesses to enable them to simply and powerfully integrate, analyze and report their data is outstanding. Customers including enterprises are increasingly selecting SQL as the database to run their most demanding workloads for mission-critical applications.
Information Worker revenue grew 5% to $2.9 billion, driven by growth in all channels. We continue to see an increased shift to our annuity offerings when customers choose to license our Office products. We attribute this to customers' desire to acquire both Office 2003 and Office 2007 upon its release later this calendar year. 
We have announced the Office 2007 suite line-up and pricing to customers. We have also rolled out the beta of Office Live. We have been pleased with the great response Office Live has received, with over 50,000 subscribers actively participating in the beta.
MBS revenue was $216 million, which was higher than our expectations and up 21% from the prior year, driven by 28% growth in license revenues, primarily in the ERP product line. We are happy with the traction that our Dynamics ERP and CRM products are receiving in the marketplace.
March marked a couple of important milestones for MBS. First, we had record turnout at our customer and partner event in Dallas, with over 5,500 customers and partners in attendance, which was over 1,000 more attendees than last year. Second, we also began our first national brand advertising campaign in a number of major publications. 
MSN revenue was $561 million and down 3%, with advertising growth of 7%, offset by an expected decline of 31% in narrowband access revenue. Display advertising revenue grew for the quarter, led by strong growth in advertising on our home page, instant messaging and Hotmail properties. Advertisers are finding that the critical mass of users on MSN and Live makes those properties the place they need to be.
On the search advertising front, we made good progress during the quarter in transitioning our business from Yahoo!'s platform to our own platform. MSN Ad Center serviced over 70% of MSN's U.S. search traffic by the end of March, up from about 18% three months ago.
Because we are still building to a critical mass of advertisers on our platforms, and we experienced lower than expected performance from partner-driven search ad pricing, revenue per search fell from the prior year's period.  Therefore, even though we experienced growth in search volumes, search ad revenue was down as we continue to transition to our proprietary ad platform, which we believe is the right business decision for the long term. 
We continue to make progress on delivering Live enabled services, which are aimed at enhancing the Internet experience.  During the quarter, we released five Live betas, averaging a beta release faster than every 20 days.  
The MED group capitalized on the growing market demand for connected devices. Broad strength across the Windows Mobile and Windows Embedded product lines led to our fourth consecutive quarter of MED revenue growth in excess of 40%.
In particular, momentum behind our Windows Mobile product line continued to accelerate in the third quarter. Licenses for connected phone-enabled devices grew in excess of 85%, driven by device launches from leading manufacturing partners and mobile operators such as Palm, HTC, UTStarcom, Verizon Wireless, Cingular and T-Mobile. Also, mobile operators shipping Windows mobile-based devices increased from 93 in the prior quarter to over 115 in Q3.
Xbox revenue growth of 133% drove Home & Entertainment results for the quarter. We extended our market leadership position in next-generation gaming and turned a major corner in the quarter with our Xbox 360 console supply. We are now in nearly 30 countries, and console supply is ramping significantly. The number of games available for the platform continues to increase, with 80 expected to be available by the end of June. We are seeing tremendous momentum behind our Xbox Live service. 
We're building on our strong early start and becoming increasingly optimistic in our console outlook for shipments. Consumer demand for Xbox 360 consoles remains very strong. Console supply increase throughout the quarter, due to improving component supplies and the addition of Celestica to Winstron and Flextronics in manufacturing. As a result, Q3 shipments of 1.7 million consoles were heavily weighted to the month of March.
Attach rates remain at record levels, although revenue in the quarter was slightly below forecast, due to the back-end nature of the console sales. According to NPD, our life-to-date attach in the US through March for software and peripherals was 4.5 and 3 per console, respectively, higher than any other gaming console at this point in its lifecycle. Despite a relatively small installed base, three of the top ten selling video games in the US in March were for the Xbox 360 platform.
Xbox Live momentum continues on a number of fronts. Over half of all Xbox 360 consoles sold connected to the service either through Silver or Gold tier memberships. Xbox Live Marketplace reached 10 million downloads of digital content in less than five months, and there have been over 4 million downloads from Xbox Live Arcade since launch. 
The momentum and success of Xbox 360 has resulted in a faster-than-expected transition to next-generation gaming. As a result, our Xbox Version 1 software revenues in the quarter continued to decline and were softer than we expected.
Lastly, we extended our leadership position in IPTV software with Deutsche Telecom's announcement that it will launch its IPTV services across Germany later this year, using Microsoft IPTV Edition platform. This is our largest IPTV agreement in Europe to date and our second-largest worldwide.
Now, for the rest of the income statement and the balance sheet. While revenue increased 13% during the quarter, cost of revenue increased 49%, due primarily to Xbox 360 console volumes. The majority of the variance from our forecast was driven by strong Xbox 360 unit shipments, with the rest due in higher console costs.
Other operating expenses increased $427 million or 10% excluding legal charges. This was also higher than our expectations, due primarily to the following drivers.
First, we invested more aggressively in our MSN business to enhance the service experience of our users, our advertisers and our partners, as well as to increase our broad collection of assets to position ourselves for monetization over the long term. We are focused on building upon our strong momentum in display advertising, making enhancements to our ad platform, improving search and augmenting physical infrastructure.
Second, we increased investment in marketing and readiness programs across a number of different areas for recently launched products, as well as future product launches. This investment included global advertising and increased hiring for field sales and marketing positions, specifically and our enterprise and small and medium business sales forces.
Lastly, we continue to hire aggressively in support of R&D, focused on new product development, examples of which include Longhorn Server, Exchange 12 and Communication Services.
Even with these investments, if you set aside legal charges and the Home & Entertainment results, which are disproportionately impacted by negative margin console sales, you'll find that operating margins remained stable during the quarter, with operating income growth in line with revenue growth. 
Investment income and other totaled $427 million, and our effective tax rate was 31%. Diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 10.4 billion, down 5% from the prior year as the result of execution against our share repurchase program.
I would like to now provide a brief summary of the cash flow statement and the balance sheet. We generated over $4.5 billion in cash from operations, a 9% decline from prior year, due primarily to the timing and magnitude of legal settlement payments. Of the over $5.8 billion returned to shareholders during the quarter, $4.9 billion was for the repurchase of 181 million shares, of which $4.7 billion doubled in the quarter. We had about $6.4 billion remaining of our $30 billion approved repurchase program at the end of the quarter.
Cash and equivalents and short-term investments of $34.8 billion were up slightly from the second quarter, due to securities pledged as collateral under our securities lending program. The related balances due to the program can be seen in securities lending payable in current liabilities, largely offset by its corresponding amount in short-term investments.
So, in summary, we delivered accelerating double-digit revenue growth, driven by new product momentum and healthy PC and server hardware shipments. We achieved double-digit bookings growth in our core businesses in front of a big year of product launches. 
Excluding the results of Home & Entertainment and legal charges, operating income grew in line with revenue, even with the big investments necessary to drive future revenue growth. We repurchased $4.9 billion in company stock, the second-largest quarterly share repurchase in company history. Chris will now provide you with our expectations for Q4 and fiscal 2007.
Chris Liddell
 Thanks, Colleen. So, I am going to spend my remaining time on the call giving you a view of what we are expecting for the fourth quarter, followed by a preliminary snapshot of fiscal 2007. Please keep in mind that all of our growth figures that I will be using reflect year-over-year growth to the comparable period, unless otherwise noted.
Before giving specific financial guidance, let me outline some of the key assumptions that we've used for the fourth quarter. We estimate that for the fourth quarter, PC unit growth should be 10% to 11%. Our expectations for growth in the total server hardware market remain unchanged at 11% to 13% for the full fiscal year, and we're assuming that changes in foreign exchange rates will not have a major impact on our year-over-year growth rates in our forecast. Also, we continue to expect overall IT spending and our ability to participate in the marketplace to remain healthy.
So for some detailed guidance, we expect fourth quarter revenue of $11.5 billion to $11.7 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 13% to 15%. Revenue by business group is as follows. For Client, we expect revenue growth of 7% to 8% for the fourth quarter. We expect OEM units to grow roughly in line with the market, and we expect commercial and retail business growth to lag overall growth.
In Server & Tools, we're raising our expected revenue growth to 17% to 18% for the fourth quarter. We expect that the strong customer acceptance of SQL Server in the last two quarters will continue in the fourth quarter.
Information Worker revenue should grow 5% to 6% for the fourth quarter. We expect the increased annuity mix in our billings to continue as we move closer to the launch of Office 2007. And we will continue to look forward to releasing a broad public beta of Office 2007 this spring.
For Microsoft Business Solutions, we expect revenue growth to be between 11% and 13% for the fourth quarter. Our new Dynamics products have been met with great customer and partner enthusiasm, and we look forward to carrying that momentum into Q4 and beyond. Our new Dynamics branding campaign started in March and should provide good momentum going forward.
For MSN, we're expecting revenue to decline 4% to 5% for the fourth quarter. This reflects continued decreases in our access business, continued transition to Ad Center for delivering our paid search results, offset by growth in display revenue.
Mobile & Embedded Devices revenue should grow between 15% and 25% for the fourth quarter, driven by the availability of new devices based on Windows Mobile 5.0.
Home & Entertainment revenue is expected to grow 85% to 110% for the fourth quarter. This reflects a reduction in the implied revenue guidance we gave you in January, due primarily to lower expectations for the Xbox 1 business.
We continue to see very strong demand for Xbox 360 consoles, and we are making good progress in our ability to supply that demand. Because of this increased optimism and strong console shipments in Q3, we are tightening our previously announced fiscal year shipment guidance of 4.5 to 5.5 million consoles to the top end of that range, to 5.0 million to 5.5 million consoles.
Given the growing mix shift to annuity billings in front of key product launches in fiscal year '07, we are increasing our unearned guidance, and now expect unearned revenue to finish the year up 10% to 12%, up 2 percentage points from where we guided in January. We continue to estimate that our contracted not billed balance will finish the year above $9 billion. 
So when you combine our overall revenue growth within the net increase in unearned and contracted not billed, you'll see that we are delivering strong year-over-year booking performance for the Company in fiscal 2006.
Operating income should be between $4 billion and $4.2 billion, representing 34% to 40% growth over the prior year, or 7% to 11% growth if you exclude legal charges of $756 million taken in that year-ago quarter. For fully-diluted earnings per share, we expect $0.30 per share for the fourth quarter, and expect to have an effective tax rate of 31% for quarter four.
So with quarter four guidance, we arrive at the following expectations for the full fiscal year 2006: revenue between $44.0 billion to $44.2 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 11%; operating income of $16.6 billion  to $16.8 billion, including certain legal charges of $361 million in Q1 and $397 million in Q3. 
For fully-diluted GAAP earnings per share, we expect $1.22 for fiscal year '06. If you were to adjust for certain legal charges of $0.02 a share in quarter one and $0.03 a share in quarter three and the tax benefit of $0.01 a share in quarter two, earnings per share would be $1.26.
The quarter four guidance is below the implied numbers we provided in January, and I would like to walk through three main drivers of the guidance change, which is split broadly evenly into the following areas.
First, we will experience higher product costs in order to enable us to deliver as many Xbox 360 consoles to the market as quickly as possible. We are making a strategic choice to produce and sell the maximum possible number of consoles to stretch our lead of installed base in this next generation over Sony. 
This will, however, cost us some income growth in the short term. In Q3, we addressed console supply challenges through securing components and improving manufacturing yields. These additional costs are not expected to continue beyond quarter four.
Second, marketing partner readiness and increased hiring in our sales force for new and soon-to-be-released products will secure their success and drive momentum. These efforts are underway and will continue in quarter four and into fiscal 2007. Examples include an increased pace of Xbox 360 marketing to coincide with increased supply, working with our OEM partners on prelaunch Windows Vista readiness programs and continuing hiring of Information Worker solution specialists.
Third, we intend to quicken the pace of development on businesses where we can drive growth and build meaningful share. This includes such areas as services, unified communications and collaboration, business intelligence, security and high-performance computing. We also intend to gain growth step-ups through acquisitions. We have accelerated the pace of targeted acquisitions and the associated costs are included here.
In regards to services, we plan to scale global sales resources for Ad Center through the developer ad platform and increase our customer support activities to optimize the experience for our advertising partners. 
We will also further develop and extend our search platform. This includes not only continuing to improve relevance, but also to move into critical developing areas such as local and mobile search. 
We will continue to add new, significant content for our MSN and Live portals, while utilizing acquisitions to quickly fill out technology and other offerings, and increase our investments in infrastructure to ensure that we can deliver world-class performance to our customers around the world for Windows Live, MSN.com, Xbox Live and Office Live.
We have been making good progress in various aspects of our services plan, such as the pace of transition to ads served by Ad Center and the continued increase in users, particularly on Hotmail and Messenger, where we added approximately 40 million Hotmail and 65 million Messenger accounts over the last year.
We're delighted to have Steve Berkowitz join the team to run the online business group. Steve was recently was a CEO of Ask.com and brings to Microsoft a deep industry knowledge on how to successfully run an online business, including both search and advertising. We are looking to his contributions to help shape and drive our strategy in this space.
Although we expect that the investment areas for our services plan that I highlighted earlier will defer operating profitability for MSN in fiscal year '07, they will position us to better monetize our online businesses over the long term, through building volume of both searches and page views, using Ad Center to offer advertisers a superior platform from which to coordinate their marketing efforts and building the volume of ads run through Ad Center by increasing the number of advertisers on our platform and expanding Ad Center geographically.
I also want to highlight that our strategy in services is not competing against any single competitor in any one area, but to deliver value-added services across a broad array of scenarios. The online services market is clearly very competitive but has enormous potential for growth. We intend to compete in this space for the long term, and feel that our investments today will drive future success.
So at this point, I would like to discuss our preliminary view of fiscal 2007 as well. Our guidance represents our best current thinking about fiscal '07, and is subject to change as we finish our planning cycle during our fourth quarter. Consistent with our past practice, we are not providing specific business group assumptions beyond our fiscal year guidance. We will provide more details, including any new initiatives, as we typically do, on our next quarterly earnings call in July and all the strategic background at our financial analyst meeting in late July.
Our current fiscal 2007 revenue forecast is $49.5 billion to $50.5 billion, which represents growth of 12% to 14% over fiscal 2006, continuing the excellent '06 momentum. In absolute dollars, that represents between $5 billion in $6 billion of incremental revenue year over year. 
Our expectation is for operating income of $18.7 billion to $19.3 billion, and fully-diluted earnings per share of $1.36 to $1.41, representing growth of 11% to 16% on a GAAP basis. If you were to remove certain legal charges and tax benefits from our '06 numbers, fiscal 2007 EPS growth would be 8% to 12%.
Now, let me outline a few key items that are necessary to understand our fiscal '07 guidance. First, at this early stage, we expect both the PC hardware market and the server hardware market growth rates to moderate from the growth rates we have seen this year.
Second, we are not forecasting any significant changes in foreign exchange rates. Actual foreign exchange rate movements will cause deviations from our forecast.
Third, we expect to see enterprise agreement renewal and discounting trends to be within their historical ranges.
Fourth, these figures assume the launch of Windows Vista and Office 2007 to business customers before the end of the calendar year 2006, with consumer availability in January. This will be the first time since calendar year 1995 that we have had simultaneous launches of these two flagship products. We're making considerable marketing and sales investments in these launches and, to a lesser extent, the launch of Exchange 12. 
Fifth, we plan to continue to make significant investments that include the areas I mentioned with respect to Q4, such as continue to execute on our services vision, aggressively competing with our Xbox franchise and building new and existing business in high-growth markets.
Finally, this guidance assumes we finish out the remaining $6.4 billion of our buyback program no later than December 2006. We have not built in any additional amounts beyond that.
So I would like to close my prepared remarks today by putting this year into a broader context. Today, we believe we face the largest array of opportunities for growth and innovation the Company has ever seen. Software and software-driven services are playing an increasingly important role in shaping customer experiences at work and at home. 
Progress made in such things as high bandwidth availability, lower computer and storage costs, hardware device innovation and improvements in processing per hour provide us with the opportunity to deliver software and services that enable seamless customer experiences in the area of services, entertainment, mobility and security, just to name a few. These markets will grow quickly over the next three to five years, as will the opportunity for us to innovate and increase our income for the benefit of shareholders.
We appreciate that every time we make an investment decision, it is traded between the short-term earnings and the long-term gain. However, we are willing to make those trade-offs, and believe that we have a unique opportunity at this part of the product cycle to drive substantial long-term growth. 
Given the level of opportunity and activity, we look forward to having a very rich discussion with you on our plans for growth at our financial analyst meeting in July. So with that, I would like to hand the call back to Colleen so we can take some of your questions. Thank you.
Colleen Healy
Let's now proceed to questions. We want to accommodate questions from as many people as possible, so please avoid multi-part questions and limit yourself to just one question. Operator, will you please repeat the instructions?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Steve Mahedy, Banc of America Securities.
Steve Mahedy  - Banc of America Securities
My question would be relative to fiscal year '07 guidance. You mentioned the moderation in the PC and server markets. Could you just give us a little detail on how you formulated the growth rates that you're assuming? And then also a tighter range on topline revenue relative to bottom-line; is there some flexibility on your spending during the course of the year, which perhaps would put us at the higher end of the EPS range?
Chris Liddell
 In terms of PC market, we don't give out numbers at this stage, obviously. We have seen a moderation in the PC unit growth rate through the course of this year, so we were seeing 15% to 17% or thereabouts in quarter one, and it came down to 14% to 15% then 12% to 13%; and in the fourth quarter, as I just mentioned, we're talking about 10% to 11%. 
So we have seen it come off, if you like, strong mid double digits to just about double-digit rates. So we're not expecting the trend to significantly weaken from that, but we expect that moderating number that would come out of the year to be more like what we expect for next year. So that's the basis of our expectations going into the new year.
In terms of the tightening of the range, to some extent it is influenced, clearly, by things like Xbox, where we could have quite a big sales variation, but not necessarily a big operating income variation, to the extent that the contribution from that business will not be as significant driving down to operating income. 
So that's one of the reasons why you're seeing that variation. In terms of could we see expenses there being at the top end of the range, absolutely. Those are some of the decisions that we will have to make during the course of the year and as we round out our budgeting cycle going into the fiscal year.
Steve Mahedy  - Banc of America Securities
You mentioned the PC moderation is clear and you can see the correlation there. However, in contrast, in the moderating server market, it still looks like you continue to see strong results there, given the product cycle. Is there a little bit of a detachment relative to what's happening in the server market, given your ability to gain more share there?
Chris Liddell
Again, it's quite a different trend, in terms of our sales relative to the server market. This is our sales relative to the PC market. So there's a lot of moving parts in the PC market. For example, our progress on piracy, the mix shift between consumer and business, and then the other moving part is our commercial and retail sales. 
So all of those go into our expectation of Client revenue growth relative to PC growth. In the server market, we tend to expect our sales of underlying Windows Server to follow more closely the market. And then we have been able to and we certainly would hope to expect to be able to pick up market share in things like SQL Server.
Colleen Healy
 We have been pretty consistent throughout the fiscal year thus far, expecting 11% to 13% hardware growth. The numbers directionally that we have given you for fiscal year '07, we feel, are right and it looks like in terms of third-party data, we're pretty much in line.
Operator
Our next question comes from Charlie DiBona, Sanford Bernstein.
Charlie DiBona - Sanford Bernstein
 I was wondering if we could maybe talk a little bit about the margin structure and some of the add-backs for this quarter? In the legal expense add back for this quarter, are you adding back a reserve you might have taken related to the European EUR2 million a day fine? And is there any build-in for that fine into your guidance?
Chris Liddell
We don't specifically comment on individual ones, but if I can put it this way, there's no change from our previous position. So there's nothing inside the legal reserve as a result of a change.
Charlie DiBona - Sanford Bernstein
There is nothing inside the legal --
Chris Liddell
 You asked whether there is anything in the legal reserve that results in a potential fine. All I'm saying is there's nothing in there -- there's no delta in that figure. I cannot comment on whether we had it in originally, because we don't give that level of detail out. But to the extent we did or didn't, it hasn't changed.
Charlie DiBona - Sanford Bernstein
So your guidance for next year -- does it include reserving EUR2 million a day?
Chris Liddell
Same comment -- there's no change in our previous assumption.
Charlie DiBona - Sanford Bernstein
So absent that, you see pretty substantial margin compression for next year, yet you have been talking about pulling forward expenses for Vista into the last couple of quarters and certainly into Q4 here. How do you reconcile those two things? It seems like you're spending fairly aggressively -- very aggressively -- through next year and not seeing leverage to your revenue acceleration.
Chris Liddell
 At this stage, as you know, we're not giving business-by-business shape, so your comment is correct at the Company level. I will point back to some of our prepared remarks. Clearly, we have decided to aggressively invest in this next year in a number of areas, and they do add up. 
Broadly, across the areas of marketing to launch new product, so clearly with Vista and Office 2007 coming, we will be spending in that area to ensure the success of that, building on some of the other businesses in the area. 
So Xbox 360, we still see a big year in fiscal year '07 for that. IPTV will launch. We will have some marketing spend associated with that. Windows Mobile, we think, will potentially have a big year next year. Dynamics branding and then overall corporate advertising -- some of the work that you've seen.
So that's in the new products area. In terms of new opportunities, things that we are building which will be revenue-generating beyond fiscal year '07 -- the areas, again, that I talked about in prepared -- communications, collaboration, security and management, high-performance computing and also some of acquisitions we are doing.
Lastly, and we have foreshadowed this previously, the services strategy and, in particular, MSN is an area that we expect to invest aggressively next year. So you are correct. The net result of all of that, as we are guiding, will mean that we will not see an accompanying level of operating income growth equal to revenue growth. But we will still see, in our view, extremely good revenue growth. The combination of this year and next fiscal year with our guidance adds up to $10 billion to $11 billion of revenue growth.
So in our view, we are investing. We appreciate we're investing aggressively relative to some of your models, but we believe it's the right thing to do, to drive what we think is extremely good growth going forward.
Operator
Our next question comes from  Adam Holt, JP Morgan.
Adam Holt  - JP Morgan
Another question on the margins, if I could. Understanding you're not giving quarterly guidance, is it safe to assume the head count adds and a lot of the marketing expenditure is going to be front-end loaded for next year? 
Secondly, are you making any assumptions around any kind of customer incentives during the holiday season to maybe give consumers that buy PCs Vista upgrade rights?
Chris Liddell
 Sorry, I will have to give you the blanket answer that we're not going to give a lot of details about the shape of next year. I apologize for that, but that's the sort of stance. It's hard to half answer your question without doing that. 
If I can talk about this fiscal year, where we are giving some numbers out, clearly, we have front-ended, if you like, some of the hiring associated with some of the product development that we see in future years. I'm certainly comfortable saying that; you can see that in our head count numbers.
I will comment on the positive aspect of that. There has certainly been a lot of commentary in the time that I've been at the Company about retention of people. What we are finding is we are having an extremely good time and being extremely successful in the market in hiring the people that we want. So the good news from my point of view is whilst it's a front-end cost, it's a good sign from an employment point of view.
In terms of the second half of your question, about tech guarantees, we're not commenting on that. Clearly, we will look at the shape of previous releases in terms of what is a sensible thing to do for our customers and partners as we get closer to the release. But with that being nine-odd months away, we are really not commenting at this stage on exactly what we might do or when we might do it.
Operator
Our next question comes from Heather Bellini, UBS.
Heather Bellini - UBS
 Not to beat a dead horse here, but looking at the operating margin, is this a change in the strategy for the Company where, over the next few years, we might see revenue accelerate from these new product launches that you have talked about, but that the Company is willing to sacrifice earnings growth? I'm not just talking about fiscal year '07, but a change in strategy where you are just going to keep reinvesting back, where earnings growth is going to be below revenue growth and you're not going to get the type of margin leverage that I think people expected when the CFOs of all the different business units were put into place?
Chris Liddell
I can't give you specifics of the directional guidance for '08 and '09. I think we will talk more at the financial analyst meeting about our strategy and how that might play out. Again, if I can just talk to what we have put out today, clearly, from our point of view, we have made a strategic decision with respect to next year that, given the set of opportunities and the revenue growth potential that we see, we're willing to make that trade-off next year, and we've been willing to make the trade-off not only next year but to get ahead of it, if you like, in the third and fourth quarter as well.
So you are correct in that sense. I don't want to say or extrapolate at this stage and say you can necessarily expect that in fiscal year '08 and '09. We will talk more strategically when we get together and talk about strategy in July.
Operator
Our next question comes from Rick Sherlund, Goldman Sachs.
Rick Sherlund - Goldman Sachs
 Chris, as I look at next year, the revenues look good. So I think that we collectively as analysts, have captured the opportunity for Vista okay on the revenue side. But the expenses, I've got to tell you, we're not that bad in forecasting expenses. 
Your expenses are about $2.4 billion more than I have estimated. I don't know if you are just not ready to talk yet about the online businesses that you're building, but I don't think Xbox mix makes that big a difference in my model. I don't think spending a couple hundred million dollars more launching products makes that big a difference.
There's something like really big here that I'm not sure we have quite put our fingers on yet, but it sounds like you are building a Google or building a Yahoo! inside the Company. Ray Ozzie in this Fortune article said, this is real expensive. It's going to cost billions of dollars. I didn't know it was going to cost a couple billion dollars in '07, but that's what looks like to me. 
It looks more like you are kind of really ramping up your online business and the decisions been to take a lot of the benefits of the product cycle that we're going to get next year and just plow that right back into the business to kind of gear up for battle in the online market. I'm just not sure if I'm missing something, but that's the way it comes across to me.
Chris Liddell
 I'm certainly happy to address that. In terms of your $2.4 billion, I probably wouldn't get to the same number as that -- I don't, obviously, have visibility into your model, but relative to the starting base of fiscal year '06. I would characterize it as being a broad-based approach across multiple fronts. 
I don't think there's any Trojan Horse there that we haven't talked about that is sitting below the surface that we don't want to talk about. I would say, to the extent there's a difference between your expectations of where we are coming in, I would list the sort of 12 to 15 things that I mentioned before, and we would be accelerating the pace in virtually all of those, relative to, possibly, your expectations.
So there are some big numbers there; that is certainly true. And there's certainly some big potential spending and opportunities that we foresee in the MSN Windows Live area. So that is certainly true. But we're not building into our guidance things that we're not talking about.
Rick Sherlund - Goldman Sachs
 Are we going to talk more at the July analyst meeting about the online business?
Chris Liddell
 Absolutely. Yes, that is an absolutely key and fundamental part of our strategy going forward, so yes, you can expect to hear a lot about that.
Rick Sherlund - Goldman Sachs
Because there is a lot going on there. I keep hearing more about it, but we haven't really had an articulation yet of what's going on. So we should anticipate that maybe we'll have a better understanding of what's going on there at the July analyst meeting?
Chris Liddell
Yes. I'm certainly happy to take that feedback, firstly. And secondly, we had foreseen that we would spend a reasonably high proportion of the time talking about that, to the extent that it's a new area, perhaps relative to some of the other ones that you have heard about previously.
Operator
Our next question comes from  Kash Rangan, Merrill Lynch.
Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch
 Just following up on Rick's question earlier, the numbers certainly look big on that incremental expense side. I'm just curious to see if a material component of that incremental spending is from stock-based compensation? Because the times when you would publicly disclose that figure, as in fiscal '05, it was running at $2.4 billion. 
So should we be thinking that there is another perhaps $1 billion or maybe even $0.5 billion or so of stock-based compensation that is being factored into your operating income? 
Because we do hear about the enormous amounts of money being paid to hire some of the super sharp programmers in the Wall Street Journal, et cetera. So is that behind your thinking, or maybe not? If you can clarify, that will be great.
Chris Liddell
 It's definitely not to do with increasing pay for the CFO, not from the billions, anyway. No, there's nothing that we are building in that is significant from a stock-based compensation point of view. 
We only disclose the numbers historically rather than forecast, but you shouldn't expect to be surprised there and anything new or substantial. Clearly, we are hiring a large number of people, so you will see the expense associated with those people. But you won't see huge fundamental shifts in our pay structure.
Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch
 So I guess, when you report your operating income on a segment basis, we should start to see where exactly these investments are going in and how they are tracking to the way you explained the 15 different initiatives or whatnot, right?
Chris Liddell
 That's correct. Yes, you will. We'll continue to try and be as transparent as possible, certainly, in retrospect.
Operator
Our final question comes from Robert Breza, RBC Capital Markets.
Robert Breza - RBC Capital Markets
Hi, thanks for taking my question.  I'm wondering, Chris, can you talk a little bit about maybe how we should think about the shape of '07, just in terms of the product releases, knowing about the enterprise. Is there anything you can qualitatively tell us, look at the December quarter versus the March quarter?
Chris Liddell
 Sorry, you just came in and out a little bit on your question there. But I got most of it, about the shape of the year. No, I'm sorry. I have to go back to what I said before, which is we are really sticking at this stage at a yearly rate. 
I mean, clearly, with the launches coming for business availability in December and consumer availability in January, there's going to be some implications associated with that. We're already seeing some patterns of change, for example, in our Information Worker area. We're seeing a shift from license to annuity, and that could well be in anticipation of the benefits of Office 2007. 
We will have some quarterly changes, almost certainly, associated with Xbox as a result of holiday season sales. So it will be some reasonably big quarterly trends that you can expect to see. But, I'm sorry, you will have to wait until July for us to give you the visibility into that.

With that, please click to slide number four, where Chris’s comments will begin. Chris?
Thank you colleen and good afternoon everyone, thanks for joining us on today’s call. I’d like to begin by highlighting the key points from our second quarter performance and take a look at the rest of fiscal year 2006.
We had a very good second quarter with highlights being three extremely successful product launches, good growth in our core businesses and delivery of operating income and earnings this year in line with expectations. We have been looking forward to this quarter as we kick off the broadest multi-year product cycle in the company’s history.
Looking back on quarter 2, we’re off to an excellent start. During the quarter we had significant on time and successful launches of products for both consumers and businesses.
The quarter’s new product launches created a lot of justifiable excitement in the marketplace. For example, the highly anticipated XBOX 360 had a phenomenal reception by consumers. Demand for the product has been high and we look forward to increasing the console availability in the second half of the fiscal year, with the addition of our third manufacturing partner.
Just as eagerly anticipated and well-received by business customers was SQL Server 2005 and Dynamic CRM 3.0. And during the quarter, we positioned ourselves well for continued momentum and setup pipeline success with two community technology preview releases of Windows Vista, the initial Beta releases of Office 12 and Exchange 12 and many Beta versions of our Window Live Update.
Our core software businesses enjoyed healthy growth, driven by strong demand from corporate customers and strong PC and Server unit segments.
Growth in client revenue and a robust PC environment was driven by consumer strength during the holiday season.
The real highlight for the quarter was that Server Tools continues its impressive string of double digit revenue growth. SQL Server generated over 20% of year over year revenue growth during the quarter, significantly outpacing the database market and our expectations from last quarter.
SQL Server 2005 is quite simply an outstanding product, meeting the needs of customers and we were delighted to have seen the faster than expected adoption at and after the launch.
We were pleased to see both business solutions and mobile and embedded devices continue their recent momentum and, in both cases, achieve operating profitability t his quarter.
While we do not expect them to remain consistently for the remainder of fiscal 2006, their strong revenue and profit performance reinforces their trajectory to exit emerging status sometime in fiscal 2007.
Lastly, during the quarter, we continue to have momentum on returning cash to shareholders. We announced a one cent increase in our quarterly dividend, equating to a 12 _ percent increase. And we purchased 7.7 billion dollars worth of our stock, our largest ever quarterly stock buyback.
Overall, we’re pleased with our performance in both Q2 and the first half of fiscal 2006.
So now, I’d like to make a few points about how the rest of the fiscal year is shaping up. First, we continue to expect double-digit revenue growth for fiscal 2006, driven by sustained momentum in our core software businesses and by strong demand for the XBOX 360.
Second, we will continue to invest in our businesses. As we mentioned on the last call, we are investing in our core businesses of client Information Worker and server tools for product launches. We will also continue to invest in MSN in order to bring rich and compelling services and content to our users and a world-class advertising platform to our advertisers. I’ll discuss a little bit more about the investment in MSN later in the call.
We’re confident that we’re making the right investments for products in the near-term horizon as well as initiatives and products that will benefit us longer-term. And even with these investments, we expect to deliver strong double-digit earnings growth the second half of the year.
So with those opening remarks, I’d like to turn the call over to Scott for more details on the quarter and then I will provide you with more details on the rest of the fiscal year.
Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon everyone. As Chris mentioned, Q2 is a good quarter overall, with revenues slightly below our guidance and bottom line results largely in line with our expectations. During the quarter, revenue was a record $11.8 billion up 9% from the prior year, driven by growth in our core software businesses and home entertainment. Operating income was $4.7 billion, which is at the high end of our expectations entering the quarter and driven by operating profitability in six of our seven busy seasons.
We delivered good earnings growth with earnings-per-share of $.34. When adjusted for tax-rated benefits realized in the quarter of $.01 per share, this is also at the high end of our guidance.
We kicked off a significant multi-year product cycle with launches of XBOX 360, SQL Server 2005, Dynamic CRM 3.0 and a host of other products. And, lastly, we returned over $8.5 billion to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases and dividends.
So while revenue is slightly below our guidance, we had a successful quarter, which I will highlight over the next several minutes.
I will start by discussing topline financial and business points and will follow with the revenue performance of each of the business units. Then I’ll wrap up with an overview of operating income performance as well as balance sheet and cash flow information.
All comparisons are meant to relate to the comparable quarter of last year, unless otherwise specified.
Our core businesses had another good quarter. Overall revenue growth was driven by server and tools revenues which grew 14% on the strength of SQL sales and client revenue growth of 8%, driven by the strength of PC hardware shipments. Add in a good quarter by Information Worker, and our three largest businesses grew revenue by a combined 9%, representing $785 million in absolute revenue growth.
Another key driver for the quart4r was the launch of XBOX 360 which drove home entertainment revenue growth of 13%. We’re also pleased with the continued momentum in our Microsoft Business Solutions and Mobile Imbedded Business units which grew 17% and 40%, respectively.
The IT spending environment was also largely in line with our expectations. The clear highlights were strong demand in the enterprise and continued strength of the PC and Server harder market growth. Demand was generally healthy across all customer segments and, from a regional perspective, EMEA and the emerging markets were relatively strong.
We estimate PC market growth during the quarter at 14-15%, which is stronger than we expected 3 months ago. A very strong holiday sales season resulted in consumer PC shipment growth outpacing business shipments for the third consecutive quarter. From a form factor perspective, growth in notebook PC shipments continues to outpace desktops.
PC unit demand was broad-based regionally with double-digit growth rates in all geographies, except for North America and Japan and emerging market growth rates continue to significantly outpace mature markets.
Our mix of product billings for the quarter was generally consistent year-over-year with roughly 35% from OEMs, 25% from multi-year licensing agreements, 20% from license-only sales and the balance from our other businesses.
We had good results, overall, from a volume licensing perspective with the strongest growth in enterprise agreements, where our renewal experience remains within our historical range of 65-70%. Select and open annuity results for the quarter are also very good, relative to non-annuity licensing.
Our unearned revenue balance ended the quarter where we expected it, at $8.8 billion, up slightly from the prior quarter and represents an 11% increase over the prior year. The sequential change in unearned balance was impacted by the relatively small amount of multi-year contract value that was up for renewal during the quarter, relative to prior year amounts.
Our contracted, not billed balance at the end of December was up sequentially and now exceeds $9 billion.
Before I get into the revenue details for each business group, I’d like to point out that the foreign exchange rate impact on revenue was not meaningful to our overall revenue growth.
So now, let’s move on to a discussion of revenue by business segment.
Client revenue grew 8%, driven by OEM revenue growth of 10%, offset by a 2% decline in commercial and retail licensing. The OEM revenue growth resulted from 15% license unit growth. The different between OEM licensing growth and revenue growth is caused primarily by a shift in channel mix toward larger OEMs with volume pricing, growing volume in emerging markets, and the relative strength of the consumer segment of the PC market, which results in higher volumes of Windows XP Home Edition and Media Center Edition, relative to total units sold.
As we discussed last quarter and consistent with the relative strength of the consumer segment of the market, we continue to see a change within the sales mix of our premium edition operating systems, licensed to OEMs. Our OEM premium mix is up 2 percentage points from the prior year, at 49%. A larger percentage of premium edition sales were made to consumers purchasing Windows Media Center, which carries a lower priced premium relatively to Windows Professional. All in all, we were pleased to see the significant market traction and continued growth for Windows Media Center edition, which has sold over 6.5 million licenses to date.
Server Tools continue to deliver double-digit revenue growth for the company, reflecting broad adoption of Windows Server System products and an exceptionally strong SQL Server 2005 product launch.
SQL Server 2005 provides a data management and analysis platform that enables organizations to reliably manage mission-critical information entered in complex business applications. Its business intelligence capabilities enable companies to gain greater insights from their business information. The value proposition of the product is outstanding and we’re delighted to see that many customers agree.
Revenue for the quarter was $2.9 billion, a 14% increase over the prior year. Continued share gains in the enterprise resulted in SQL Server revenue growth in excess of 20%. During the quarter, we also successfully launched digital studio 2005, BizTalk Server 2006, and Windows Server 2003R2, adding to our already strong product lineup.
Our enterprise services businesses also continued to show solid progress, with revenue growth of 17%.
Information Worker revenue was in line with our expectations, growth 5% to $3 billion. Revenue growth related to volume licensing and pre-installed versions of Office in Japan were strong.
This quarter we experienced an increased annuity mix in our overall billings, which we attribute to customers desiring to acquire both Office 2003 and Office 12 upon its release later this calendar year. During the quarter, we also released a preview of Office 5, our future services offering targeting small businesses as well as the technical data of Office 12, which garnered positive reviews from the industry.
MBS revenue was $242 million, which was higher than our expectations and up 17% from the prior year, driven by the early release of Microsoft Dynamics CRM 3.0 and strong results in EMEA. As a result of the strong revenue growth, we were pleased to see MBS achieve operating profitability in the quarter.
We also shipped new versions of Dynamics GP 9.0 and Dynamics SL 6.5 during the quarter.
MSN revenue was $593 million, down 2%, driven by advertising growth of 12%, offset by an expected decline of 33% in narrow-band access revenue. We are pleased with the display advertising, which grew in excess of 20% for the quarter. We improved display advertising pricing and increased our inventory while increasing the number of users of our services. Active Hotmail accounts grew to 230 million, compared to 191 million in the prior year. And, active Messenger accounts grew to 205 million, compared to the 156 million of the prior year.
As you know, we’re in the middle of a transition in search advertising business, moving from Yahoo’s platform to our own proprietary platform called MSN Ad Center, which we began testing in the US during the quarter. The ramp-up of a new ad platform requires significant investment from Microsoft, both in development costs as well as in reduced revenues related to fewer numbers of overall advertisers and resulting lower key word pricing. The good news is that response to our platform has been great and we are ramping up deployment by rapidly envoying advertisers and moving more search traffic to the platform.
On algorithmic search, we are continuing to grow query volume, improving relevance and are investing in several search verticals. We have recently launched mapping, the birds-eye flyover mapping service and are soon to launch news and images. We continue to invest in search for long term and believe there’s lots of innovation yet to come.
The decline in our narrow-band access revenue is in line with our expectations as customers continue to move on to broadband.
MBD revenue for the quarter grew 40% on broad strength across the Windows Imbedded and Windows Mobile product lines as we continue to capitalize on growing market demand for connected devices. Windows Mobile licenses for connected phone-enabled devices grew in excess of 70% from the prior year. Windows Imbedded product growth of 64% was driven by the increasing use of Windows CE and Windows XP Imbedded in a wide range of smart devices such as point of sale terminals and thin clients.
As a result of the strong revenue in the quarter, MBD also achieved it its first quarter of operating profitability.
Home and entertainment revenue growth for the quarter was 13%, driven by the XBOX 360 launch and solid growth of our consumer hardware and PC games product lines.
During the second quarter, XOB 360 achieved an unprecedented video game console launch, and we are thrilled with the results. We were first to market in 19 countries with XBOX 360 and have garnered record software attach rates, indicative of the strength of our games portfolio. On XBOX Live, we continue to lead the way in online gaming. Whereas, on XBOX Version 1, about one in ten customers are connected to the XBOX Live service, on XBOX 360 more than half of all consoles are connected.
We’re off to a strong, early start with all these factors and coupled with the continuing uncertainty of our competitors entering the next generation, we are right where we want to be.
Demand for XBOX 360 consoles has been incredibly strong and feedback on the platform has been incredibly positive. Our previous challenge in the quarter was meeting the high consumer demand for the console. We sold 1.5 million XBOX 360 consoles in the 2nd quarter, with 900,000 consoles in North America, 500,000 consoles in Europe and the remainder in Japan. This is lower than we expected due to component charges stemming from challenges in ramping supply of a complex product like XBOX 360. We believe that this is a short-term manufacturing challenge and we have taken steps to increase supply to meet the strong consumer demand for the console.
A key indicator of platform health is the attach rate for games and accessories. According to NPD, software attach for the XBOX 360 in the US was more than 4 per console and accessory attach was more than 3 per console for the quarter. Both are records with consumers purchasing nearly double the amount relative to any other console launch in history. The software results, in particular, highlight that we have launched XBOX 360 with an incredibly strong lineup of games.
XBOX Live continues to lead the way in defining online entertainment and is regarded as the standard by which all other online gaming services will be measured. Since the launch of XBOX 360, XBOX Live members have downloaded over 4 million pieces of high definition games, music and movie content from the XBOX Live marketplace.
Lastly, our XBOX Version 1 platform remains a great value to consumers. We sold over 2.2 million XBOX 1 consoles in the first half of the fiscal year, bringing the installed base to over 24 million worldwide, with 16 million in North America and 6 million in Europe. All the demand for XBOX 1 consoles and software sales was negatively impacted by the momentum and excitement surrounding the XBOX 360 launch.
Now for the rest of the income statement and balance sheet.
While revenue increased 9%, cost of revenue increased 19%. This increase was due to costs primarily associated with the XBOX 360 console volumes. The remainder of operating expenses increased about $750 million or 18%.
As we discussed in the past, we are investing aggressively in our businesses to satisfy customers and to compete and win in the marketplace. Investments this quarter were focused around the following areas: strong levels of high end investment in research and development focused on new product development examples of which include Windows Vista, Office 12, Longhorn Server, Exchange 12, MSN Ad Center, Search and Communications Services. Advertising focused primarily on our clients and worker information businesses as well as overall corporate branding. Increased hiring for field sales and marketing positions is scored in future revenue growth. Specifically in our enterprise and small and medium businesses sales forces as well as our Information Worker specialists. And, marketing spending associated with the product launches in the quarter including SQL Server 2005 and XBOX 360.
As you know, we have always taken a long-term view of our business. Today’s investments in product R&D and Sales and marketing lays out the foundation for future revenue and profit growth.
Investment income in other totally $400 million including $212 in net gains on investments and $185 in net losses on derivatives, primarily related to losses on foreign exchange contracts and commodity positions.
Our effective tax rate for eh quarter was about 29%; lower than expected due to a $108 million tax benefit associated with the settlement of state audits.
Now for a brief summary of the cash flow statement and balance sheet.
We generated over $2.2 billion in cash from operations, a 38% decline from prior year due to increased spending on XBOX 360 inventory and other changes in the working capital.
Of the over $8.5 billion returned to shareholders during the quarter, $7.7 billion was for the repurchase of 283 million shares, with the remainder for dividends. During the quarter our board of directors also announced a $.01 increase in the regularly quarterly dividend; bringing it to $.09 per share, per quarter.
Cash and equivalents in short term investments were down $5.4 billion and 13% sequentially for the first quarter, to $34.7 billion, reflective of the record amount of share repurchase activity in the second quarter.
So in summary, we achieved record revenue of 9% growth driven by our core businesses, representing over $1 billion in absolute revenue growth versus the prior year. We will continue to invest to fuel revenue and profit growth in the future. Our earning per share was at the high end of our expectations, excluding tax benefits for the quarter. We executed on key product launches kicking off a significant, multi-year product cycle and we repurchased our stock at record levels.
With that, let me turn it back to Chris who will provide you with our expectations for Q3 and the rest of fiscal 2006.
Thanks, Scott. As some of you may know, Scott’s in the process of transitioning into his new role as the head of the OEM group. Microsoft OEM Channel is obviously critical to the company’s success and we look forward to his contributions there. I’d certainly personally like to take this opportunity to thank Scott for all of his hard work and dedication in driving functional excellence across finance. Moving into his new role will allow Scott to continue forward in his already substantial impact here at Microsoft. However, I’m sure he will also dearly miss joining us here on these quarterly calls.
Now I’m going to spend my remaining time on the call giving you a view of what we are expecting for the third quarter and the rest of the full fiscal year. Please keep in mind that all of the gross figures that I am using reflect year-over-year grow to comparable period, unless otherwise noted.
Before giving specific financial guidance, let me outline some of our key assumptions around the economy and general demand in the industry. With calendar 2006 underway, we expect overall IT spending to remain healthy in the new year. We feel good about our ability to participate in any growth in the overall marketplace in the coming year. We estimate for the 3rd Quarter PC unit growth should be 11-13%, primarily as a result of higher than expected growth in the first half of fiscal 2006, we are raising our full fiscal year estimate to 12-14%.
Our expectation is that growth from the total server hardware market remain unchanged at 11-13% for the full fiscal year.
For our forecast, we’re assuming that changes in foreign exchange rates will not have a material impact on our year over year growth rates. So now for some detailed guidance.
For the full year, we’re tightening the revenue range that we gave you in October, as we now expect revenues to come in between $44.0 and $44.5 billion, representing growth of 11-12%. We’re forecasting the Q2 strength in our core software businesses to continue into the second half.
For the 3rd quarter we expect revenue up $10.9-$11.2 billion, representing year over year growth of 13-16%.
Revenue by business group is as follows:   For client, expect revenue growth to be 7-8% for the full fiscal year and 7-9% for the third quarter. We expect OEM units to grow roughly in line with the market, aided by growing traction in emerging markets. In server and tools we’re raising our expected revenue growth to 15-16% for the full fiscal year and 15-17% for the third quarter. We are forecasting continued corporate demand for our server products with SQL Server 2005 continuing to show strong market acceptance. Information Worker revenue should grow 5-6% for the full fiscal year and 6-7% for the 3rd quarter. As we move closer to the launch of Office 12, we expect corporate customers to increasingly prefer annuity licensing programs when evaluating Office purchases.
For Microsoft Business Solutions, we expect revenue growth to be 14-15% for the full fiscal year and approximately 16% for the 3rd quarter. Demand for our new Dynamic CRM 3.0 has been above our expectations and we’re forecasting the recent strength to continue through the 2nd half.
For MSN, we’re expecting revenue to be flat for both the full fiscal year and the 3rd quarter, which reflects slightly lower revenue expectations for this business in fiscal 2006, driven primarily by our plans to accelerate the rate at which we ramp up Ad Center to deliver our paid search results. While this is an important strategic decision for the long-term, it does have a dampening effect on revenue for search in the short term.
Additionally, as I spoke about earlier in the call, we will also be making additional investments to strengthen the competitive position of our internet services. Areas of investment include for example, global infrastructure, where we are investing in global infrastructure in order to provide high quality performance and reliability for our customers on a global basis. In Ad Center, we’ll be hiring a thousand support people to provide great end-to-end service for our advertising customers, investing in development talent to increase the range of functionality for advertisers, and thus increasing their ROI, increasing traffic to Ad Center to speed the transition from Yahoo’s network and finally, rolling out Ad Center to more countries globally, to provide end to end advertising solutions to our customers everywhere.
In Search, we’re investing in search verticals by increased development resources and via acquisitions. For example, we bought GeoTango, which is a 3D internet visualization technology company, to enhance Windows Live Local Search.
We’re confident that we’re making good investments for products on the near term horizon as well as for initiatives and products that will benefit us longer term.
Mobile and Embedded devices revenue should grow greater than 30% for the year and about 35% for the 3rd quarter, driven by a number of exciting new devices, based on Windows Mobile 5.0.
Home and Entertainment revenue is expected to growth between 35% and 45% for the year and between 80% and 100% for the 3rd quarter, which reflects a reduction of the revenue guidance that we gave you in October, primarily as a result of 2 factors. First, lower expectations for the XBOX 1 business as the moment around XBOX 360 has drawn some attention away from the previous platform. We expect to continue to sell the XBOX 1 console well into the calendar year 2006 and certainly see this as a stretching out of the sales cycle. There are 800 games currently available for the platform and we expect there will continue to be a great deal of new content from third party publishers in the coming years. Second, we have slightly slower expectations for our consumer hardware, software and PC games business. We’ve also lowered our estimate of XBOX 360 console sales in the first 90 days of launch from 2.75 – 3 million units to 2.5 million units due to supply constraints. Even so, we estimate that consumers will spend over $1.5 billion in total retail value on XBOX 360 consoles, games and peripherals in these first 90 days, which is indicative of the health and magnitude of the XBOX 360 launch.
As you know, we’re bringing on a third manufacturing partner, Salistica, next month to help in meeting strong consumer demand for the XBOX 360 console. For that reason, we are not adjusting our previously announced fiscal year console sales guidance of 4.5-5.5 million consoles and our revenue guidance, which is based on unit sales within that range.
We continue to expect great software sales for XBOX 360, resulting from a strong flow of new games for the platform over the coming months. By the end of June, XBOX 360 will have more than 50 high definition games from the best names in publishing.
We delivered an unprecedented global launch during the quarter and by the end of March, XBOX 360 will be available in nearly 30 countries and will remain on track to be the fastest selling video game console in history.
Operating income for the full fiscal year is expected to be between $17.9 billion and $18.3 billion, representing growth of 23-25%. Brief note, this full year guidance includes the charge we took in Q1 of $361 for the settlement of Real Networks. Before significant settlement and other such items, operating income for the full fiscal year is expected to be $18.3-$18.6 billion, representing double-digit growth of 10-12%.
For the 3rd quarter, operating income should be $4.5-$4.6 billion, representing 36-39% growth over the prior year or 11-13% growth if you exclude the $768 million settlement charge taken a year ago to quarter.
For diluted earnings per share, we’re tightening the range that we gave you in October by raising the low end of that by $.01. The range is $1.28-$1.31 for the full fiscal year on a GAAP basis. If you were to adjust for the Real Networks settlement charge of $.02 from the first quarter and the $.01 tax benefit in the 2nd quarter, earnings per share will be $1.29-$1.32. We expect GAAP earnings per share of $.32-$.33 for the 3rd quarter and expect to have an effective tax rate of 31% for the 3rd quarter and the remainder of the year.
On the balance sheet, we’re still expecting unearned revenue to finish the year up 8-10%, and it’s likely to be at the higher end of that range. We’re also raising our estimate on our contract and our billed balance to now finish the year above $9 billion. This is up from our prior guidance of finishing the year at $8 billion.
When you combine our overall revenue growth with the net increase in unearned and contracted not billed, you’ll find that our year over year booking performance for the company for fiscal 2006 is strong and we feel confident about how we will end the year.
So in closing, I’d like to say that I’m pleased with our 2nd quarter and our fiscal year ’06 performance on three counts; first, the customer reaction to our newly launched products has been fantastic. Second, our ability to deliver our products on time, which – given the style and complexity of our product range – reflects a great performance and an increasingly improved operational discipline. And last, we made our expense targets for the quarter.
With that, I’d like to hand the call back to Colleen so we can take some of your questions. Thank you.
Thank you Chris. Let’s now proceed to questions. We want to accommodate questions from as many of you as possible, so please avoid multi-part questions and limit yourself to just one question. Operator, will you please repeat your instructions?
Question-and-Answer Session
Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star 1. To withdraw your request, you may press star 2. Once again, to ask a question, please press star followed by 1. Our first question comes from Adam Holt with JP Morgan.
Good afternoon. Two questions on the unearned commentary. To get to the higher end of the 8-10% growth for the year, when would you expect to start to see an acceleration in the Information Worker bookings in front of office? And secondly, can you talk about some of the things that you’re doing to try and accelerate client bookings as well, particularly with Vista enterprise?
We do actually have quite a large number of contracts that are maturing and that’s one of the reasons that we feel confident about the balance being at the high end of that range. The first half of the year was a relatively modest period for expires and the second half is a relatively high one. On the Information Worker side we’re actually already starting to see what we think is a shift away from fully-priced products to the enterprise side. So, we’re starting to see that impact already and we believe that will continue through the first half of this calendar year, second half of the fiscal year. On the client side…what was the question about client?
What other number of initiatives in place to try and drive long term contracts on the client side in the context of the Vista release? I was hoping you could update us on that and also talk about when we would expect to see that acceleration.
We haven’t built in the expectations on the enterprise side for the 2nd half. We certainly think we’ll start to see some year on year benefits as the calendar year proceeds and as we get closer to the Vista launch. We are seeing some benefits, for example, in the new software assurance product that we launched last year. So, as opposed to a declining trend that we’ve seen in previous quarters, that’s flattened out and it will improve but we haven’t built a lot of that into our expectations for the 2nd half of the fiscal year.
Thank you.
Thank you very much, Adam. Next question please?
Thank you, our next question comes from Rick Sherland with Goldman Sachs.
Thanks. Just first on a technicality…can you reconcile why the cash flow statement shows $7.4 billion of stock repurchase and you’re saying $7.7 billion in the text?
What’s going on there Rick is that not all of the buy-back fell within the quarter. So, the difference that you’re seeing is inter-quarter settlement. We’ll catch that up next quarter when it’s settled.
Okay. And the constraints on supply for XBOX 360, if you could just talk for a moment about that. Could you be more specific with us about what that is? It doesn’t seem that if it’s a supply constraint that adding Salistica necessarily helps that. If you can kind of add some clarity there.
As we said in our prepared remarks, we had some issues with some of the components. There’s nothing that we think is systematic to the extent that we’ve solved some of them or will be solving any that we haven’t resolved, in the short term. So, it’s not a constraint that we see that’s going to be significant going forward. Let me just reiterate, in terms of the volatility that we can expect in the first few weeks with a product of that significance, launched across 90 countries, loss is at the low end of our expectations and it’s not surprising from our perspective; we don’t think this is a significant issue for the first six months.   Thank you so much, Rick. Next question please?
Thank you. Our next question comes from Charly DiBono with Sanford Bernstein.
Hi. Can we turn to MSN for a second here? It looks like your search ads are slightly down year on year and basically flat sequentially. You talked a little bit about the impact that Ad Center’s having on your pricing, does that mean that in areas where you’re not Beta testing Ad Center that you’re not seeing any deterioration in search pricing? And then, what has your experience been in France and Singapore as you’ve gone live with the product? Are you seeing a recovery in pricing there? And a related question would be, what are you doing so that the deteriorating leverage you’re getting on your community in your partner ads?
I’ll take those in parts, Charlie. In terms of the Beta test thing, no there isn’t a positive impact from that. In fact, as we initially ramp up because the volumes are lower than what they are on the combined Microsoft/Yahoo platform, we actually see a deterioration in the pricing. That will take some time as we need to ramp up the critical mass and volume. So that has a negative impact. In terms of the expectations that we had of receptivity, that’s going in fact better than we had hoped for which is one of the reasons why we’re accelerating the ramp up. But it does have a negative impact. In terms of the overture of pricing, no I don’t believe we saw a deterioration of pricing on the non-Ad Center-based ads during the quarter. But as we’ve said before, we don’t have a lot of visibility in there, so the trends that we are seeing, unfortunately is something that is opaque to us. One of the reasons why we’re moving faster on Ad Center and taking control of our own destiny.
And what about the partner network where you’ve seen some deterioration as well?
It’s not significant in my mind, from a financial point of view. So I’m not entirely sure what you’re referring to from a numbers point of view, but there’s nothing systematical.
You mentioned it in your MDNA.
The partner issue is the partner-driven prices. So that’s the same question as overture. What we’re seeing a bit is for the partner-driven…in other words, the parts that we don’t control our own fate on, we’re seeing pricing pressure which surprises us a bit. We’re going to take our fate into our own hands and we’re going to ramp up ad center. Given that we’re ramping that up, we probably don’t have tons of life left on these partner-driven prices; it sort of is what it is and we’re sort of focused on making our Ad Center platform best-in-class.
Thank you.
You’re welcome. Next question please?
Thank you. Our next question comes from Mary Meeker with Morgan Stanley.
Thanks. I have a quick question; I think Brian may have one as well. Chris, for the last couple of quarters you’ve had very strong PC unit growth but client revenue growth has not been as strong. You drilled down all the reasons for that, emerging markets, mix, etc. But the delta is large, is this the kind of delta we should just expect on a go-forward basis as we go through our modeling?
I think you can realistically expect if not all that delta then some large part of it for the rest of this fiscal year. You take our guidance on PC unit growth and on revenue, that’s the delta that we expect based on those mix factors. Going into fiscal year ’07, I don’t know if you want to get into forecasting that at this stage, but we would certainly see for example fully-priced packaged product sales being different in our launch year with something like Vista, so that impact which is being measured would be something that would be different.
Do you think we could narrow it to something like a 300 basis-point difference?
To some extent, we’re already seeing in the quarter some narrowing. If you remember sort of last year we were down sort of mid- to high teens on commercial retail. We did see some narrowing this quarter, we’re down 2%. If you look at our guidance on the back half, it continues to narrow in terms of where we think the PC market is coming and where our revenue is coming and hopefully that’s some sort of indication about our expectations.
Okay that’s great. Thanks a lot.
Mary, the other factor is it depends a little on the absolute size of the PC growth. So as it gets larger, it’s tending to come from the consumer area which is tending to make it get bigger. So in a year where the PC growth was say lower, you might expect the gap, all things being equal, to be narrower.
Just a quick question to follow up on the 360. Are you still on target for the 4.5-5.5 million consoles by June? I know you put down a number of 4.25.
Yes, we are still on target in that range.
Great, thanks.
Next question, please?
Thank you our next question comes from Heather Bolidi with UBS.
Hi, thank you. I just wanted to follow up to Mary’s last question. I was wondering if at some point if Skeet Balmer said there’s a mix to higher-end SKUs, could you see the fact that the consumer is making the gap bigger right now as he just mentioned? Do you see that change with Vista in the big uptake of things such as Media Center with PC edition? And I guess the follow up would be there’s some concern in the market that Vista might not make it out for the 2006 holiday season. Is there any update you could provide for us on that? Thank you.
From our perspective we’ll still talking about Vista launching in the 2nd half of this calendar year so, nothing’s changed there. In terms of the swing in mix, we are seeing inside the consumer side of things a positive mix swing. For example, as you mentioned Media Center, so that is helping. But on the other side, in terms of emerging markets, and the growth that’s there relative to mature markets, if like a negative mix we have a lot of price points in those. So there’s a number of moving parts. But in terms of the consumer, consumer side of mature markets, we definitely see Media Center traction and that is helping us.
I just want to make sure.
I’d like to add to that…going back to our financial analyst’s meeting we have made some general comments about SKUs and having more differentiation within our SKU strategy, what you’re seeing for example with the SQL Server 2005 launch is we had 4 different SKUS, took the high end up, had a nice lower end SKU. In terms of software assurance announcements, Heather, you’ve heard us talk about Vista enterprise edition available to customers. So I think what you can expect to see and what you’re beginning to see from us is differentiation within our SKUs.
Great. Thank you.
Next question please?
Thank you. Our next question comes from Kash Rangdan with Merrill Lynch.
Hi, thank you very much. I was just wondering given that you’re seeing better attach rates with the XBOX 360 and the software component makes it look richer versus your prior expectation, why would that not be even a little bit more profitable to the degree that you might want to reconsider where you stand on BPS guidance on the positive side? That’s it, thanks.
Kash, we want to be sure we understand the question there. Can you just repeat it?
With better than expected attach rates for the game cartridge for the XBOX 360, and if you’re maintaining your forecast for unit shipments, it sounds like the high margin software component of the total revenues should be a positive that you might consider revising your APS forecast for fiscal 2006 on the upward side.
Thank you. Offsetting that to some extent is the XBOX 1 sales and the software associated with that and also HRB revenue in each of the segments. To the extent that they are profitable elements and we’re lowering those, then that has an offsetting impact.
And Kash, we’re just thrilled to see the unprecedented attach rate with the game console. Keep in mind that at this point it’s really the hard core enthusiasts that are getting involved in midnight madness. They may be more inclined to take the extra game, the extra peripherals. We want to be nice and conservative there and not necessarily forecast that too aggressively.
The other thing, Kash, is outside of the FCB segment, as Scott mentioned in prepared remarks, we are making some investments in MSN and Ad Center and some of the impacts of the small acquisitions that we’re doing in that area, for example GeoTango. So, that is also offsetting – from an operating income point of view – some of the other benefits.
Got it. Finally, in unearned revenue you talked about 8-10% growth in fiscal 2006; it looks like it’s growing actually north of that. The last 3 quarters it has been 12-13% so, is it just conservatism as you head into a product transition or anything else behind that forecast?
Yes, quite often on a quarter-by-quarter basis, relatively big swings depending on the seasonality and the expiration pattern.  So, the 8-10% is just how we see it year on year, given what we see in the 2nd half. There’s nothing that’s more significant than that.
Thanks.
Thanks so much Kash. We only have time for 2-3 more questions. The next question please, operator?
Thank you, the next question comes from Brent Phillips with Prudential.
Thank you. Chris, you mentioned that CRM 3.0 was exceeding expectations. Are there any metrics to back up the success of that product in the market that you gave out with SQL Server 2005?
Just the revenue growth inside the overall segment. I don’t know if we split up the CRM in terms of growth, coming off such a low base, it was an extremely high number and I don’t think it will … it was triple digits, from memory. I’m not sure it will give you a good indicator. But in terms of actual dollars, it was just extremely well-received. And, if I could put it this way, the reason for the out performance in that particular segment, it was virtually all CRM, so that’s one way in order of magnitude form it.
Just to follow up to Heather’s question around Vista, you’re saying second half of the year; is there any more granularity. Will it make it in the back-to-school segment or should we expect a late ’06 ship?
At this stage, we really aren’t saying anything more than what we previously hit. Obviously, in the next quarterly call that we have in April we’ll foreshadow ’07 and we’ll certainly be happy to talk about it at that stage.
Fantastic, next question please?
Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Maynard from Credit Suisse First Boston.
Hi, good afternoon. Given your interest in AOL, could you maybe talk from a corporate development perspective how you’re thinking about MSN and some of the other sort of advertising related businesses around that market? Outside of the investment that you’re making, obviously, in building better  and whatnot? 
I don’t want to obviously speculate on anything having to do with acquisitions. I think Steve has spoken quite openly and I certainly talked on previous calls on our willingness to consider acquisitions as a way of fueling growth. We have been doing a recently significant number of them. In fact we’ve been announcing roughly one a month. They’re small to medium-sized and to a large extent that’s the ones that we think really give us good value for our money. And, we certainly expect to continue to do some of that. But in terms of speculating on larger transactions or their impact on particular businesses, that’s not something I really want to do.
That’s fair. Maybe just any color you can give us on the composition of the strength of your SQL Server, like geography or if you can give a little detail on where you saw the…
Very broad-based really. It didn’t peak in any particular area or any particular segment. It was just incredibly well received across the board.
Thank you.
Thanks so much. We have time for one final question, operator.
Thank you, our next question comes from David Hiller with Friedman, Billings, Ramsey.
Great, thanks. Kind of a follow up to the Ad Center questions. Outside of France and Singapore, what are the milestones you have for launching Ad Center? Can you give us any specific dates or rough dates for the rest of this calendar year in terms of deployment of Ad Center? Thanks.
In the US I believe we have around 15-20% of our ads served in the US through Ad Center and trending towards 25%. I’m not sure I want to say there’s a particular date, but certainly by spring of this year I would say we’d expect the bulk of our US business to go through Ad Center.
Thank you.
