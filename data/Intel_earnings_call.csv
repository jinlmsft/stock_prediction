Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.
A brief reminder that this quarter we have provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we will be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The earnings presentation and earnings releases available on intc.com include the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations.
With that, let me hand it over to Bob.
Bob Swan
Thanks Mark. And thanks to Navin and Murthy who will participate in the Q&A later in the call. Before I get into the results, I'll take a minute to address what I expect is a top of mind question, the status of Intel's CEO search. The Board continues to evaluate candidates for what I believe is the biggest and best open job on the planet. They are proceeding with a sense of urgency while also ensuring that they make the right choice for this great company. Meanwhile, Murthy, Navin, the entire management team and the 107,000 employees have come together as a team to continue driving Intel's transformation to a data centric company. Our 2018 results demonstrate the progress we've made, and I'd like to share those results with you now.
2018 marked Intel's golden anniversary. It was a truly remarkable year for a remarkable company. Full-year revenue grew 13% and crossed the $70 billion mark for the first time, setting an all time revenue record for the third consecutive year. Our data center, Internet of Things, programmable solutions, memory, mobile eye and modem business businesses each set all time full year revenue record.
2018 was also a pivotal year in Intel's transformation to become a data centric company pursuing an expanded greater than $300 billion market opportunity. Intel's collection of data center businesses grew 20% in 2018 after adjusting for McAfee. The largest of our data centric businesses, the Data Center Group, delivered record annual revenue of $23 billion, up 21% year-over-year on strong cloud demand and growing share with communication service provider customers.
Our PC centric business achieved 9% growth in 2018, as the PC market stabilized and we gained share in modem. While 2018 was a record year, we expected a stronger finish. Fourth quarter revenue of $18.7 billion was up 9% but short of our expectations as a result of a dramatically weakening modem demand, lower overall growth in China, cloud service providers absorbing capacity and a weakening NAND pricing environment. While revenue fell short, we exceeded our EPS outlook by $0.06 or about 5%.
We continued to deliver outstanding new products for our customers and previewed new innovations that positions Intel to compete and win for years to come. And we also made significant progress in growth areas like AI, Autonomous Driving and 5G. I'll take a few minutes to give some specifics before we dive into the financial results.
Over the course of the quarter and culminating at CES, we highlighted breakthrough innovations that will be central to our product leadership for years to come. We outlined our product design philosophy, which combine six pillars of innovation, process technology, architecture, memory, interconnect, security features and software to consistently and reliably deliver leadership products that solve our customers' most challenging problems.
One example of this designed philosophy in action is our unique Foveros 3D packaging technology. Foveros enables active stacking of logic chiplets for the first time in the industry's history, and left those mix-and-match process technologies and architectures to deliver breakthrough products. The first such product Lakefield is slated for production in 2019. Lakefield features a 10-nanometer hybrid CPU architecture combining a Sunny Cove CPU core, four low-power Atom CPU cores, Gen 11 graphics and more in a dime sized product that enables the smallest PC motherboard ever possible.
Foveros business tremendous design flexibility and pace away for a myriad of devices and systems combining high-performance, high density and low-power silicon process technologies. In the datacenter, we began shipping the new Cascade Lake family of high-performance EM processors with DL boots for accelerated AI performance, hardware-based security mitigations and the first implementation of Optane DC persistent memory. Many of our datacenter OEMs and cloud customers are now offering early trials with Intel Optane DC persistent memory, which is enabling entirely new usage models and improved system performance.
In client computing, we launched our new 9th gen Intel Core desktop product line up for gaming and content creation, growth segments that demand Intel performance. We also previewed our upcoming 10 nanometer Ice Lake client CPUs, which will deliver unprecedented levels of integration, including DL Boost inference acceleration, Wi-Fi 6, thunderbolt 3 and Gen 11 graphics, our first integrated GPU with a full teraflop of performance.
Our 10 nanometer yields continue to improve and Ice Lake remains on track to be in volume systems on retail shelves for the 2019 holiday selling season. In Q4, we also made important progress in AI, 5G and autonomous driving. For artificial intelligence, we saw accelerating adoption of OpenVINO, our open source toolkit for neural network optimization and the rapid deployment of AI based computer vision.
In addition to the strong adoption of OpenVINO by the developer community, we also launched several new products during the year, including our third generation vision processing unit. Our partners created a catalog and AI based vision accelerator cards with our VPU you and FPGA product. While digital video was once a vertical within the IoT business, AI based machine vision is becoming a critical horizontal capability that cuts across all IoTG verticals. And our leadership portfolio, both hardware and software solutions, is removing the barriers to deployment and accelerating IoTG's growth.
We also highlighted a new AI product on our roadmap, the Nervana neural network processor for inference or NNPI, which is designed to accelerate inference workloads and achieve the highest performance per watt in the industry. We expect NNPI to be in production this year. 5G is another big opportunity for both our PC centric and data centric businesses. At CES, we unveiled the new 10 nanometer based network system on chip, codename Snow Ridge developed specifically for 5G wireless access and edge computing. Snow Ridge will bring Intel architecture into wireless access base stations, and allow more computing functions to be distributed out at the edge of the network. We expect to be in production on Snow Ridge in the second half of this year, which is also when we'll deliver our first 5G modem, the Intel XMN 8165 5G.
In autonomous driving and ADAS, Mobileye's efforts to lead this revolution continues to build momentum with 28 new design wins and 78 vehicle model launches in 2018. In the fourth quarter, we announced plans to commercialize mobility-as-a-service in Israel with Volkswagen and Champion Motors, making Mobileye's rest of products, technologies and services unmatched in the industry. Mobileye's products now span from open ADAS and AB compute platforms to turnkey vehicle retrofits to ultimately mobility-as-a-service. And they are enabled by the industry's best vision algorithms and driving policy software. The groundbreaking RSS model for AV safety and REM real-time crowdsourced maps.
At CES, we announced important progress for both RFS and REM. IPS, China's leading industry organization for transportation standards approved a proposal to standardize RFS for the China market. We also completed the mapping of Japan's Highway system, 25,000 kilometers of roads using data harvested from a customer fleet of vehicles outfitted with EyeQ4 in just 24 hours.
This is a path that would have previously required thousands of hours of driving and scanning using specialized vehicles. This sort of breakthrough is possible only with Mobileye's combination of technology and massive market scale, and it positions Mobileye to monetize ADAS and AV technology long before level four and five autonomy are deployed at scale. And REM will be monetized in areas beyond autonomous vehicles. We just announced the partnership with ordnance survey to use data collected via consumer vehicles outfitted with EyeQ4 to help utilities manage infrastructure.
Looking back at 2018, it is abundantly clear that Intel's employees, the unstoppable engine driving our innovation, are more determined than at any point in our history to make Intel technology the foundation for the world's most important innovations and advances. Not only was it a record year from a financial perspective, we achieved major milestones in terms of our diversity and inclusion goals. We reached full representation in our U.S. workforce two years ahead of our plan. We also achieved gender pay equity across our global workforce. And to celebrate 50 years of Intel, more than 68,000 employees volunteered approximately 1.5 million hours in the communities where we operate. I'm proud of what Intel employees achieved in 2018, and I'm equally proud on how they responded to challenges.
With that, let's turn to the financial results. The fourth quarter closed the record 50th anniversary year with strong data centric and PC centric growth. Revenue for the quarter was $18.7 billion, up 9% year-over-year. Our data centric businesses were collectively up 9% and our PC centric business was up 10%. Operating margin of 35% was approximately flat with strong mix and continued spending leverage, offset by 10 nanometer cost and growth in our adjacent businesses. Strong business performance, spending leverage and a lower tax rate resulted in non-GAAP net income of $5.9 billion, up 14% year-over-year. EPS of $1.28 was up 18% year-over-year.
For the full year of 2018, we generated $14.3 billion of free cash flow, returned $15.3 billion to shareholders, including $5.5 billion in dividends. We purchased 217 million shares and increased our buyback authorization by $15 billion. Free cash flow was $1.2 billion short of our October expectations due largely to an increase in accounts receivable.
To summarize, we had a strong quarter and fantastic year with full year revenue up 13% or nearly $6 billion higher than our original forecast in January. Earnings per share was up 32% and free cash flow was up 38% over last year. We're expecting another record year in 2019. And as a result of our continued growth, we are raising the dividend 5%.
Our Leadership products continue to win share in our expanded TAM, as both our data centric and our PC centric businesses continue to grow in the fourth quarter. Our data centric businesses were up 9% for the quarter as customers choose our performance products to move, store and process more data faster from the cloud to the edge. And our PC centric business was up 10% as we saw continued strength in the commercial and gaming PC segments and we gained modem share.
Moving to earnings, we generated solid EPS expansion in the quarter, up 18% year-over-year. And our operating income increased $580 million with operating margin approximately flat year-over-year in the quarter. Our EPS improvement was driven by growing demand for higher performance products in the data center and client businesses, leading to higher volumes in ASPs, continued spending leverage, a lower tax rate and lower share count as a result of buybacks.
Our focus on operational efficiency continues to produce strong results with 2018 spending as a percentage of revenue at 28.6%, down over 7 points since 2015 and meeting our 30% commitments two full years ahead of our goal. R&D is up $1.4 billion over the same period as we continue to increase investments in areas that will drive growth in our expanded TAM, such as product leadership, artificial intelligence and autonomous driving. Over the last three years, we've grown annual revenue by more than $15 billion, while adding less than $250 million in spending, resulting in a more than 25% increase in revenue per employee.
Now some Q4 performance highlights by segment. The Data Center Group delivered another greater than $6 billion revenue quarter and a growing storage and networking CPU TAM that is greater than 30 million units. Revenue of $6.1 billion was up 9% year-over-year but below our October expectations. Year-over-year growth decelerated as all three major verticals within DCG were impacted by weakness in China demand and as some CFPs move to consume capacity put in place earlier in the year. Platform unit volume was up 9% and ASPs were up 1%.
Our Xeon ASP grew mid single-digits as customers continue to transition to Xeon Scalable and a richer mix of higher performance products. We also saw ASP expansion in our SoC products and much higher SOC volume as we continue to have success in network transformation. The higher SoC volumes resulted in more modest blended platform ASP growth.
Non-CPU adjacencies were down 2%, driven by several large one-time deals in the fourth quarter of 2017 that did not repeat in the fourth quarter '18. Cloud revenue grew 24% year-over-year, decelerating from Q3 '18. Enterprise and government revenue declined 5% year-over-year on a very challenging compare versus fourth quarter of 2017 and weaker China demand. Com service provider revenue grew 12% year-over-year on continued MFS gains as customers choose to virtualize and transform their networks on Intel architecture.
Our other data center business IoTG, NSG and PSG achieved solid growth in Q4, together were up 9% year-over-year or 13% excluding the Wind River divestiture. Our Internet of Things business had revenue of $816 million, down 7% or up 4% excluding Wind River with operating profit of $189 million, down 27% year-over-year due to primarily supply constraints. Mobileye revenue was $183 million, up 43% over the last year as design wins and ADAS adoption continues to accelerate. Our memory business delivered revenue of $1.1 billion, up 25% year-over-year due to strong data center growth and continued Optane adoption, offset by a weaker NAND pricing environment. The shift of our data center and client SSDs to our 64 layer 3D NAND continues in both the data center and client businesses with volume mix greater than 75%. NSG was approximately breakeven for the year.
As expected, Micron exercised its right to call Intel's interest in our joint venture I am/technologies. This announcement does not change Intel's plans in the coming quarters and the close of the call is at our discretion up to one year after the date of the call with a supply agreement that extends beyond the close. We have manufacturing options available and have been shipping a broad portfolio of Intel Optane's technology products for more than a year. We will continue to expand our product line and lead the industry with this exciting new technology. PSGs revenue came in at $612 million, up 8% and strength in the data center income segments. We saw continued momentum in PSG's datacenters segments, up 50% over last year and the advanced products category, our 20 and 14 nanometer solutions grew an outstanding 70%. Operating profit was $162 million, up 4% year-over-year. 
Finally, the client computing group delivered another outstanding quarter with revenue of $9.8 billion, up 10% year-over-year. Commercial and gaming demand continued to be strong. The notebook segment grew 8% year-over-year, the desktop segment grew 3% year-over-year. Supply remains constrained, particularly at the value end of our product range. We are working closely with our customers to align demand with available supply, while we add capacity. And we expect supply demand balance to improve by midyear. Client adjacencies grew 45% year-over-year, driven primarily by increased modem share gains. Though modem revenue fell significantly below our expectations as a result of weaker smartphone demand.
Our operating profit grew 402 million year-over-year with operating margin up 1 point. While our PC volumes were down 2%, our leadership product performance and segmentation contributed to strong mix. The investments we have made in the business organically in two acquisitions are delivering excellent cash flow generation. For 2018, we generated $29.4 billion in cash from operations. We invested $15.2 billion in capital expenditures and delivered $14.3 billion in free cash flow, up 38% year-on-year and closing the gap versus EPS by 4.5 points. During this period, we returned the 114% of our free cash flow to our shareholders. Buybacks totaled $10.7 billion and dividends totaled $5.5 billion. In addition, settlements of our convertible debt reduced fully diluted shares by $40 million.
To wrap-up with our full year results, we ended 2018 our 50th anniversary year with our third consecutive year of record results. Revenue of $70.8 billion up 13% year-on-year driven by 20% growth in our data centric businesses, and 9% growth in our PC centric businesses. We started the year in January and expecting to generate $65 billion in revenue, 30% operating margin, and $3.55 in EPS. The growth that we and the industry have seen has been remarkable. We ended the year approximately $6 billion higher in revenue with operating margin of 35% and $4.58 in EPS.
Operating income of $25 billion was up 25% on strong execution across the businesses and disciplined spending. In October, we provided a preview of our outlook for 2019. At the time, we described a combination of tailwinds and headwinds that were balanced. The tailwinds were in expanded and growing TAM, products momentum and business mix. The headwinds were tougher compares following an especially strong 2018, and increasingly competitive environment and global trade.
Since that time, trade and macro concerns, especially in China have intensified. Cloud service providers shifted from building capacity to absorbing capacity and the demand pricing environment has further deteriorated. Those incremental headwinds are impacting our revenue expectations and slightly reducing our operating margin percentage forecast. The remaining factors are roughly consistent with our October assessment.
Now, turning to our outlook for 2019. We expect 2019 to be another record year for us as the world's appetite for the analysis, transmission and storage of data continues to grow. We are forecasting revenue of approximately $71.5 billion, up 1% year-on-year and operating margin of approximately 34%, down less than a point year-on-year. We expect a modest decrease in gross margin percentage, driven by the 10 nanometer ramp and the growth of our adjacencies. This will be partially offset by increasing OpEx leverage as we continue to make thoughtful trade-offs and invest in R&D that will accelerate our growth and profitability.
We expect the full year tax rate to be approximately 13.5% following several beneficial discrete events in 2018 and we expect EPS of $4.60. We expect gross capital expenditures of $15.5 billion with logic spending up and memory spending down. The increase in logic CapEx reflects our effort to meet our customers' needs and avoid constraining their growth, while our investment in memory is focused on the sit up of our independent technology development facility in New Mexico. And finally, we expect free cash flow of $16 billion, an increase of approximately 12%.
As we look to the first quarter of 2019, we are forecasting revenue of approximately $16 billion flat year-on-year excluding Wind River. We expect PC centric revenues to be up low single digits on higher modems share and data centric revenues to be down low single digits on broad weakness in data center and continued NAND pricing pressure. We expect operating margin of 29% down 1point year-over-year with a decline in gross margin as a result of the 10 nanometer ramp and the growth of adjacencies, partially offset by increased spending leverage. We expect EPS of $0.87 flat year-on-year.
We expect 2019 to be our fourth to record year in a row. We feel great about where we are and where we're going. Five years ago, we set out to transform Intel from a PC centric company to a data centric company. Today, our strategy, products and people, are delivering on that ambition with strong growth, record results and the largest TAM opportunity in the company's history.
I've been inspired and humbled time and time again by our employees' commitment to this company, their colleagues and our customers, and we're just getting started. I am convinced the board will close on a new CEO in the near future and I believe the management team, myself and 107,000 employees will rally behind him or her to take this company to a whole new level. In the meantime, we will not be distracted by the board.
With that, let me turn it over back to Mark and we'll get to your questions.
Mark Henninger
Thank you, Bob. Moving on now to the Q&A as is our normal practice, we would ask each participant to ask just one question. Operator, please introduce our first questioner.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse. Your line is now open.
John Pitzer
Just relative to the DC, the data center guidance for the full year above mid single digits year over year in calendar year '19, you did a good job explaining what's causing the weakness in Q1 DCG and the NAND pricing. But as you look throughout the year from a minus low single digits to full year being mid single digit growth. You’re kind of looking for an acceleration against what becomes part of year-over-year compares in the June and September timeframe, at least. I'm just curious if you can help us frame how you think that reacceleration occurs how long of a pause products are you are seeing with the cloud customers? And importantly, how are you thinking about increased competition in '19 in the data centric businesses, especially in the server business as you think about mid-single digit year-over-year growth?
Bob Swan
I'll take a stab, and then Navin is here with me as well, I am sure he has a few comments. First, I would say that as we look at just overall demand for the data center environment, the end user demand by consumers and by enterprises, the workloads that we're seeing, the continued growth in workloads, we are as excited about the future as we've ever been. So we feel pretty good about the medium and long-term trend. As you know in 2018, our growth rate particularly in the cloud was up 45% through the first nine months of the year. So what we saw in the fourth quarter was, as I've mentioned, we saw a little bit of consumption going on. As you know, the purchases are done in cycles, massive purchases through the first nine months. And we started to see some of those purchases consumed in the fourth quarter. And we end the year we think with inventory levels on the server side of the business just a little bit higher than they have been historically.
So as we project forward in the first six months of the year, we think that it's going to continue to be both consumption on the server-side and pricing in the NSG environment to be down through the first six months. And consistent with historical patterns, we do expect the purchasing to start picking up again in the second half of the year. So that's how we see it. Medium long-term we feel great, massive buying in the first nine months. The buying slowed a bit in fourth quarter and we expect that to continue through the first six months. I think the last part of your question I think just competitively, and then I'll kick it over to Navin. We're going into 2019 with every expectation to compete to protect our share position across our entire business. So we're obviously investing in the capital required to ensure we don’t constrain customers' growth. We're continuing to invest in R&D. And third, we're going to invest to protect our competitive position, both on the PC side and the data centric side.
So yes, we expect competition to be stronger as we go through '19. But our guidance incorporates the fact that we're going to fight to protect our position.
Navin Shenoy
Maybe the only thing I would add, John, is that from a product point of view, the dynamic to think about in 2019 is that as Bob mentioned, we began shipping for production Cascade Lake, our next generation Xeon. And really that product is going to ramp, start to ramp in the middle part of the year and into the second of the year. The design momentum looks very strong. The product features look very compelling. The AI capability we have with DL Boost to support for Optane for persistent memory, the security hardware mitigation fixes, so that the customer momentum around that pipeline looks very strong. But it really doesn't ramp into the middle to the second half of the year. So as Bob said, the first half a little bit tougher but second half with product momentum, as well as what we're hearing from our customers, we expect to be better in the Data Center Group.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.
Stacy Rasgon
So maybe generalize on that. If I just look through your guidance, you're basically guiding flat in Q1. And roughly flattish for the full year, which suggests that overall you're looking for a revenue trajectory in 2019 that’s very similar to the trajectory you had in 2018, which was very, very strong sequentially in many of the quarters. So I guess what is the risk just given everything that's going on that that maybe too aggressive, especially as you had a number of drivers in 2018, both on the data center as well as on the client side that aren't going to be repeating in 2019. How do we think about that?
Bob Swan
 Well first, yes, 2018 was a great year. And as we mentioned earlier, it grew during the course of the year. But a function we believe Stacy is just the end demand for data, and we haven't seen that slowdown at all. Again, on workloads insights from our customer and the industry, workloads continue to grow. The demand for analytics for compute for storage, for rapid retrieval, we think only continues to grow. And we believe that we have a very good position as we go into the year, including the products that Navin referenced. So we go into the year we think setting expectations in line with how we expect things to play out.
And I would say you know today our outlook is little more cautious than it was two months ago. And we try to take into account both the macro economics, the geopolitical risks, the modest inventory build as we enter the year and the competitive environment. And we've taken those into account and reflected them the best we can as we go into the year. And we feel you know we feel pretty good about how things stack up right now. And our expectation as we have in the past is to deliver on the commitments we make as we kick off the year.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research. Your line is now open.
Pierre Ferragu
I was surprised Bob on your CapEx guidance and especially on the memory side. So my understanding is that last year you spent about $3 billion there with about half of that money actually coming from your clients, so not actually Intel Capital being deployed. So if you had $1.5 billion build out of Intel Capital deployed memory last year. If I look at your guide and think logic is slightly up, memory is going to be slightly down. So the actual Intel Capital invested deployed into memory this year is going to be up massively, maybe closer 2x and that's in a year in which everybody in the value chain, everybody in the memory industry is actually putting back on CapEx and limiting capacity addition. So I'd love to understand how you see that and how you position Intel this year in memory?
Bob Swan
First, just maybe start with as we see free cash flow for the year, we expect to be up $2 billion year-on-year with gross capital relatively flat. And I think you said this but just to repeat, 15.5 going to 15.5. During the course of '19, our expectations are of that mix that we'll be more logic oriented. And that's really driven by a couple things; one, ensuring we have the capacity to meet the 14 nanometer demand for our customers; secondly, as we ramp 10 nanometer in 2019 and position for 10 in 2020, we'll invest the additional capital there; and then third, obviously, our expectations there to continue to invest in next node of technology and particularly 7 nanometer.
The logic capital is going to be going up year-over-year. And as we indicated, memory capital will be coming down. We put the capacity in place in Dalian during the course of the '17 and '18. And our expectations are in 2019 that we have sufficient capacity for demand. However, we are going to be investing in our own capabilities or self-sufficiencies for Optane product. So we will use some capital on building out Optane capacity but memory capital will be a bit lower -- gross capital will be a bit lower during the course of the year.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Stanley with Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Chris Stanley
I'm going to shift to the expense line. So maybe give us a little more color on OpEx and gross margin trends, and how you are going to hit the operating margin target?
Bob Swan
So first gross margin, the qualitative context is we expect gross margins to come down modestly off of Q4 levels and a little bit more off full-year 18 levels. And we do expect that that will be largely, although not completely, offset by outstanding as a percentage of revenue coming down again in 2019. I think just on the gross margin, the trends are going to be a little bit similar to what you see in the past. Although, we do expect a little bit less ASP gross margin improvement from ASP. We expect unit cost to be up a little bit and that will be primarily as we ramp 10 nanometer. And then the mix dynamics of more memory and more modem will weigh on gross margin a bit. So year-on-year, we expect gross margins to come down a little bit.
On spending, as you know, we exit this year with spending levels down in the 26% in the fourth quarter and little under 29% for the full year. So we're way ahead of our the three year plans that we laid out a couple years ago, and we feel pretty good about the progress we've made on the spending. We've done it without cutting R&D. During that timeframe, R&D has grown. We've been investing in the right things. Those things are growing faster. As a result spending has come down 700 points from 2015 levels. As we go into 2019, spending overall we expect to come down. Some things we did during the course of the second half of '18, including the exit of -- we exited Wind River, we exited wearables, we exited some of our new technology small little businesses. We exited those businesses in the second half of the year. And we did some restructure in the second half of the year. So as we go into '18, all that benefit from a relatively low Q4, $4.9 billion run rate, we expect that standing for the full year will be down year on year.
So your net all that together and we have a -- we've been really focused on growing the operating income dollars of the company. We’re not -- we focus on but we're not preoccupied with where the gross margin is going to land. Our focus has been on how do we grow the operating income dollars of the company. And a relatively small growth year, we see keeping operating margins at 34% to be a relatively good place without shooting the investments we need to make to continue to progress into '19 and '20.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Ross Seymore
Just want to follow up. Bob you gave a lot of great detail there on the margin side, especially on the OpEx side. I want to go right back to the gross margin side though. And somewhat simplistically perhaps, but you kept the gross margin guide basically the same as you did at the end of last quarter despite the headwinds to mix seemingly with your data centric commentary and data center being worse and your revenue being lower. So is there any more color you can give on the puts and takes that leads to just the modest decrease given those other variables that seem like they have increased as headwinds from when you last talked about gross margin in '19.
Bob Swan
The gross margin, Ross, isn't really any different. The puts and takes back then as I indicated were modest ASP growth as we are going to fight to protect our market share position, we don't expect a lot ASP growth. Again, 10 nanometer ramp not really any different, I highlighted it in the prepared remarks we feel very good about where we are. And ramping 10 nanometer during the course of the year to get systems on the shelf for the holiday season, so no real change there. And modem and memory growth will be a little bit slower today versus where we were 90 days ago. So on the operating margin percent that's a slight positive.
The real only change from 90 days ago is just we're a little more cautious on our revenue outlook, and our spending hasn't really changed. So we got a slight, not as much to leverage that we expected back in October, but still good spending leverage during the course of the year. So, not really any difference on the gross margin and spending dynamics that we thought 90 days ago except a little less leverage on the spending line.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Vivek Arya
Within DCG, how should we think about the mix of cloud versus comps, versus enterprise for Q1 and 2019? Thank you.
Navin Shenoy
We've been over the last 18 months working hard to diversify the end customer segment mix inside of DCG. And the three large components, the enterprise and government segment, the Cloud segment and the com segment. Cloud and coms is about two thirds of the business now where it was about one third several years ago. And so I don't see any major changes to the way things play out in terms of where the growth will come from as we look into 2019 and beyond. While the first half in the cloud will be a little bit tougher, we do expect that cloud continues to grow as they start to move into build out again in the second half. The com segment, we continue to gain share in that segment, a large TAM where we have relatively small share. And as we grow our network SoC portfolio and as the market moves to 5G, we expect to continue to gain share.
And in the enterprise and government segment, while we've seen stabilization there over the last four or five quarters we're not really counting on the enterprise and government segments for growth. We do expect that enterprises will continue to make strategic choices about what to deploy on-premise and what to deploy in the cloud. And in general, that business is not one that we count on for growth. So in general, you'll see us continue to push on comps and cloud to drive growth, particularly in the second half of the year.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Caso with Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Chris Caso
Just wanted to receive an update on the some of the CPU shortages that you've been experiencing, and how you are progressing on alleviating those shortages. What affect that may have had on the Q4 results given that I guess there was some supply tightness at least coming into the quarter. And then on that with demand slowing a bit, is there any fear, do you have any visibility about customers who may have attempted or succeeded in building some inventory in those shortages?
Bob Swan
First, in the fourth quarter just in terms of isolating how we prioritize our capacity. There were no shortages. Within the client business prioritization of big core and to a lesser extent small core lower value oriented products. And so we do feel like we constrained a fairly healthy PC ecosystem in the fourth quarter. I think when the dust settles on PC TAM, our expectation is that was probably flat and our shipments were down 2%. And that was the function of we delivered every product that we could right up through December 31st. So we did have some constraints on the ecosystem and on our customers during the course of the quarter.
At the end of the year, Chris, I think inventory levels relative to the beginning of the year, were a little bit higher, maybe a week and a half, two weeks higher as we enter the year. Our expectations for the year is the PC TAM is going to be relatively flat and that process is a good place to be. We're probably halfway through the PC refresh cycle. And we still think it'd be relatively flat during the year. Inventory levels in the channels a little bit higher ending the year. For us inventory levels were relatively low as you might imagine on CPU just because of the constraints we've been dealing with.
Our expectation is working with our customers that we will be through the supply constraints as we exit the second quarter of the year. Again, we'll use the same prioritization of server, big core small core. But we'll be a little bit short on some product mix and on small core until we get probably through the second quarter. And that will constrain us a little bit on just overall growth in the first half of the year.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Harlan Sur
Just wanted to get an update on 10 nanometer manufacturer built in. Last quarter, the team mentioned 10 nanometer yields were tracking 14 nanometer yields at a similar point prior to production ramp. Is the team still seeing good improvements in 10 nanometer yields? Are you still tracking 14 nanometer yield ramps? And can you just give us an update on early 7 nanometer development and manufacturability?
Murthy Renduchintala
I can only add to what Bob said in his opening statements that we continue to make solid progress against our plan that we shared with you during the course of 2018. And as I said on the last call, I feel better about our traction today than I did 90 days ago. So that continues to bode well for our product launch ambitions, which Bob summarized is having systems on shelf for holiday season in 2019 with a barrage of products across all of our businesses to follow shortly thereafter.
And I would like to take the opportunity to just remind everybody that at CES and in the analyst meeting we had the end of last year, we did show 10 nanometer across the entire portfolio of our product ranges. We talked about Ice Lake clients, which clearly was top of mind in the early discussion. So we also talked about Lakefield. Bob mentioned that as well. Navin talked about 10 nanometer for Ice Lake server. And we also talked about 10 nanometer moving into our network in 5G program which we believe is going to be a big growth sector.
So the story is not just about 10 nanometer yields but 10 nanometer now being a key part of our entire product portfolio. And as I say, I think that coupled with our focus on the pillars of technology that Bob talked about, in my mind I think puts our product portfolio looking forward in a pretty good position. So net-net, I think 10 nanometer is looking better now than at the last earnings call. It's broadly deployed across our portfolios. And that in combination with the other technology ingredients that Bob talked about, we believe sets us up for a pretty exciting product roadmap.
Operator
Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Your line is now open. 
Ambrish Srivastava
Bob, I just wanted to go back to the NSG and the profitability in what was a really booming year for memory. Obviously, prices started to come down back half of the year but NSG was barely profitable. So just from a CFO perspective, what is your tolerance level for having a business segment that could go into a deep cyclical 6% downturn and not could? It is heading into a deep cyclical downturn. So how do you think about having a commodity within the Intel umbrella and again, the risk tolerance – not the risk tolerance for lack of profitability? Just your perspective on that please, thank you.
Bob Swan
First, a couple of things. When we look at, I mentioned this in the prepared remarks and Murthy touched on it. When we look at the technologies that we believe are going to be imperatives and going forward in this increasingly data centric world, process, CPU architecture, interconnect, software, memory is a key component. And all the advancements in CPUs will be constrained if you don't have differentiated technology in memory. So we think that the role memory plays going forward is increasingly important.
In terms of the just the CFO lens of having a commodity in the portfolio, I'm not too excited about it. And that's why the investments we're making in memory are for what we believe differentiated technology, both in the manufacturing process capabilities of 3D NAND, but also the differentiated technology for Optane and the role that it plays, both on the PC side but most importantly for us on the data centric side. So we're not particularly excited about commodities. When we make these investments, it's really geared towards products and technologies that are increasingly important, and those technologies that are differentiated from the core memory space that help us in conjunction with the CPU solve customers' problems.
Navin Shenoy
And I'll just maybe add one thing, it's Navin, as an example of that. The Optane persistent memory combined with Cascade Lake and Xeon plus Optane that is a platform play. Optane persistent memory works uniquely with Xeon. And as I think about and talk to customers about the massive amount of data growth we're seeing, the ability for us to uniquely tie those two assets together to solve customers' problem is a differentiator for us, and allows us to drive growth. And so to the extent we can exploit more of those opportunities, things get more exciting from a business unit Xeon point of view.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is now open.
Timothy Arcuri 
Navin, I had a question for you. And there seems to me a little bit of different tone between what we hear from your cloud customers, the compute guys, you and the memory guys, are seeing weakness but the networking company still sound fine. So is it just an inventory digestion of computer and servers, or is there something structurally happening there?
Navin Shenoy
I think as Bob said and I think we've talked about a little bit. We had three quarters and really, really strong growth in 2018 in the cloud, and that was driven by product cycle, as well as the typical multiyear build out pattern with Xeon scalable. And if you look back at all the historical trends we have had in the cloud business, we've always said there is some lumpiness to the business, and there is periods where people build and then there's periods where people consume. The signals we get from our customers is period of build for compute is going to shift now to a period of consumption, and that started in the second half in the fourth quarter and we expect that to continue through the first half of the year.
Secularly, over the long-term, meaning in the long-term, the cloud business is going to continue to grow. There's no doubt about that. Both the consumer cloud and the enterprise commercial cloud, we see both of those continue to grow. And the appetite for compute I think is somewhat insatiable. Bob talked about compute cycle growth. Our five-year forecast for compute cycle growth or MIPS growth is 50% CAGR over the next five years. And I see nothing slowing that down over the next number of years. So that'd be how I answer that one.
Bob Swan
Maybe if I could just close out, Mark. We think 2018 was a great year. Our strategically what it is we're trying to do and the opportunities we see are as strong if not stronger today heading forward as they've ever been. We think '19 for us is going to be another record year. At the same time, we realized that first quarter is just going to be lower and the practical reality is we got -- we think we have a reasonably good read on the level of inventory that's in the ecosystem. I'd say this particularly for -- we’re getting better and better on the Diagnostics around the DCG business. The Q4 to Q1 dynamics for DCG historically have been sequentially down 8% to 10%. And the practical reality is as we see it now is that could be double in the first quarter. But that has nothing to do with the strength of the business, the product line portfolio we have coming and our excitement about delivering a real strong 2019 as we go forward. So thank you very much for joining us. And I'm sure we'll talk to you soon.

With that, let me hand it over to Bob.
Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
Thanks, Mark. This summer we celebrated our 50th anniversary, and this quarter was the best quarter in our 50-year history. Record quarterly revenue of $19.2 billion was up 19%. Our operating margins expanded 5 points, and earnings per share of $1.40 was up 39%. Our results were driven by incredibly strong demand and customer preference for the performance of our leadership products across the business. Our Data Center, Client Computing, Internet of Things, Memory, and Mobileye businesses all achieved record revenue. We expect 2018 to be the best year ever and our third record year in a row.
Before we get deeper into the financials, I'll take a few minutes to talk about our strategy, our products, and our people, first our strategy. We are growing share in a larger TAM, driving operating leverage while increasing our R&D investments, and delivering attractive capital returns. Our thesis is that the massive growth of data worldwide will increase demand for the analysis, storage, and sharing of data. We are one of the few companies that touches every part of the data revolution, and we've invested both organically and acquisitively to capitalize on these trends to accelerate the growth of the company, while at the same time delivering significant operating leverage and exiting non-core businesses.
Our disciplined focus is delivering outstanding results. Demand and growth this year continued to exceed our expectations. Collectively, our data-centric businesses are up 22% year to date, led by growth in the cloud and communication service provider segments.
In both our data-centric and PC businesses, our CPU leadership puts us in a great position to capitalize on this massive data opportunity by delivering more value to a broader set of customers. We've expanded beyond CPUs with memory, modems, FPGAs, and silicon for emerging high-growth workloads like ADAS, artificial intelligence, and 5G communications.
We acquired Mobileye, which has integrated Intel architecture to produce the industry's leading ADAS and autonomous driving platforms. Mobileye also just announced the ability to fully retrofit existing vehicles to deliver full autonomy, moving Mobileye further up the value chain.
The acquisitions of Altera and Movidius are enabling us to partner with customers to expand the markets that they serve. They are developing new AI capabilities by combining our Core products with our FPGAs and VPUs. This is most evident in computer vision applications, which cut across all of our IoT verticals.
As a result, our opportunity has never been bigger. We are competing and winning share in a $300 billion TAM, transforming from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company in the process. We now expect full-year revenue to grow more than $8.4 billion over 2017. And in the first nine months of the year, we have returned $12.6 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends, or 112% of free cash flow.
We've also achieved outstanding growth in our PC-centric business. After seven years of decline, we expect modest growth in the PC TAM this year, and we continue to gain share in modems. We focused our investments in the PC sector on the areas where we see growth and where our performance leadership and differentiation matters most, the commercial, gaming, and 2-in-1 segments.
Second, our products, our strategy is delivering results because we have products that are solving our customers' problems. We're making the products we have even better and expanding our portfolio to deliver more value to customers. One of the most important things we do is collaborate with our customers and ecosystem partners to deliver exciting new computing experiences. We do that broadly with our OEMs. An example in our PC business was the launch of the stunning new HP Spectre Folio, a 2-in-1 we worked closely with HP to develop.
We leveraged our expertise in thermal tuning and motherboard miniaturization while achieving up to 19 hours battery life through power tuning and the use of Intel's low-power display technology. This sort of innovation isn't possible without Intel's exceptionally broad range of IP and the scale and expertise to partner deeply with our customers on design. We also launched the new 9th gen Intel Core desktop processors, including the world's best gaming processor.
In our data-centric businesses, we announced 95 new performance world records for Xeon Scalable and continue to see strong adoption while we work with customers to get ready for the transition to Cascade Lake. Cascade Lake introduces hardware-based side channel mitigation, Intel DL Boost with 11x inference speed-up, and a revolutionary new technology, Optane DC Persistent Memory. And we're deepening our engagement with customers on custom SKUs. In fact, we'll have 60% more custom SKUs in the Cascade Lake family than the prior generation.
We shipped our first revenue units of Optane DC Persistent Memory to Google, Microsoft, and Alibaba, and we're already receiving great feedback. Microsoft reported a new performance record of 13.7 million IOPS using Xeon Scalable and Optane, a level they said they've never seen with any other platform approach.
Customers also continue to choose Intel as a partner as they use artificial intelligence to transform their businesses. Taboola chose Intel Xeon over GPUs for a massive inference speedup and scale-out across seven data centers, delivering 360 billion content recommendations monthly. Rolls-Royce will design autonomous ships running inference on Xeon and are evaluating more of our portfolio in a multiyear engagement.
Mobileye customer momentum continued, with eight new design wins at major U.S. and global automakers, bringing our 2018 design win total to 20. Mobileye also shipped 3.3 million EyeQ SOCs in the third quarter, bringing the lifetime total to more than 33 million units.
While our current product lineup is compelling, our roadmap is even more exciting. We continue to make good progress on 10-nanometer. Yields are improving, and we're on track for 10-nanometer-based systems on shelves during the holiday 2019 selling season. The breadth of IP we've assembled combined with Intel's design, software, packaging, and manufacturing capability, gives us an unmatched ability to invent the industry's future.
Third and most importantly, our people, Intel has amazing talent, including world-class scientists and engineers, and we are making excellent progress toward our commitment to a fully representative workforce. Intel employees are at their best when they're working together to address challenges. And faced with explosive and unexpected demand this year, they've exhibited incredible problem-solving skills to deliver this quarter's results.
The PC TAM has returned to growth, and our Data Center business is growing at more than twice the rate we expected in January. Our full-year revenue outlook is now more than $6 billion higher than our January forecast, and we have supply to support this revised guidance thanks to outstanding responsiveness from our factory teams.
We are focused on doing everything possible not to constrain our customers' growth. We've increased our CapEx by $1.5 billion since January to a record $15.5 billion. We've repositioned some 10-nanometer capacity to 14-nanometer, and we're making progress with our 10-nanometer process technology.
Supply is tightest at the entry level of the PC market and in our IOTG business. Within our CPU product lines, we're prioritizing the production of our Xeon and Core processors so that we and our customers can serve the high-performance segments of the market. Our biggest challenge in Q4 will be meeting any additional PC and IOTG demand beyond our guidance, and we do expect fourth quarter upside from here will be limited.
Summing it up, our strategy, leadership products, and amazing people combined to produce the best quarter in the company's history. We're well on track to another record year.
With that, let's turn to the details. Third quarter revenue of $19.2 billion was up 19% year over year. Our data-centric businesses were collectively up 22% and our PC-centric business was up 16%. Outstanding business performance, continued operating leverage, and a lower tax rate resulted in non-GAAP net income of $6.5 billion, up 34% year over year. EPS of $1.40 was up 39% year over year.
Year to date, we have generated $11.2 billion of free cash flow and returned $12.6 billion to shareholders, including $4.2 billion in dividends and $8.5 billion in buybacks, repurchasing 167 million shares.
We continue to see strong momentum in our business and are raising our full-year revenue guide by $1.7 billion to $71.2 billion. We are also raising our EPS guide by $0.38 versus July to $4.53 and our free cash flow guide by $500 million to $15.5 billion. Our revenue guidance for 2018 is up greater than $6 billion versus our January expectations, as we focus on a strong finish to a record year.
Our leadership products continue to win share in our expanded TAM, as both our data-centric and PC-centric businesses grew at double-digit rates this quarter. Our data-centric businesses were up 22%, as customers choose our performance products to move, store, and process more data faster from the cloud to the edge. And our PC-centric business was up 16%, as we saw continued strength in the commercial and gaming PC segments and grew modem share.
Operating income increased by more than $2 billion, with margin up 5.1 points year over year in the third quarter, marking our highest operating margin percentage since 2011.
EPS climbed to $1.40, up 39% year on year. Our EPS improvement was driven by growing demand for high-performance products in the Data Center and Client businesses, leading to higher volumes and ASPs, continued growth in our adjacent businesses, a lower tax rate, and lower share count as a result of buybacks.
Our focus on operational efficiency continues to produce strong results. We now expect full-year spending as a percentage of revenue to be approximately 29%, down about 7 points since 2015, while R&D is up $1.4 billion over the same period. We continue to improve our leverage while increasing investment in our key priorities, such as product leadership, artificial intelligence, and autonomous driving.
Disciplined spending with a focus on prioritizing the most important investment opportunities is a key lever in magnifying our revenue opportunities, and it's apparent in our results. Over the last three years, we've grown annual revenue by nearly $16 billion while adding less than $600 million in spending, resulting in a more than 25% increase in revenue per employee.
Now some Q3 performance highlights by segment, the Data Center Group delivered its first $6 billion revenue quarter, as it shipped more than 8 million CPUs into an annual server, storage, and network and CPU TAM that is greater than 30 million units. Revenue of $6.1 billion was up 26% year over year, and operating income of $3.1 billion was up 37% year over year.
Q3 operating margin was 50%, and we continued to see strong acceleration in both the cloud and comm service providers segments, which make up more than two-thirds of DCG revenue. Platform unit volume was up 15% and ASPs were up 10%. Non-CPU adjacencies grew 14% over last year.
The cloud business grew 50% year over year, with strong growth trends across our diversified customer base. Our comm service provider segment grew 30% year over year, as customers continued to transform their networks with Intel architecture as they prepare for 5G. And our enterprise segment was up 1% year over year, as the strong IT spending environment continued, with CIOs prioritizing investment in private and hybrid cloud implementations.
Our other data-centric businesses, IOTG, NSG, and PSG, achieved solid growth in the third quarter, and together were up 13% year over year or 17% excluding Wind River.
Our Internet of Things business achieved record revenue of $919 million on broad business strength, up 8% or 19% excluding Wind River. Operating profit was $321 million, up 120% year over year, on growing demand and revenue scale. Mobileye had record revenue of $191 million, up approximately 50% over last year, as ADAS adoption continues to accelerate.
Our Memory business delivered record revenue of $1.1 billion, up 21% year over year, as we continued to redefine the storage paradigm with industry-leading, low-cost, high-density NAND SSDs and the revolutionary performance of Optane drives. We have now reached a crossover point, with 50% of our data center and client SSDs shifted to cost-effective 64-layer 3D NAND, leading to rapidly improving cost per gigabyte. At the same time, as a result of pursuing 3D XPoint development independently and a tougher NAND pricing environment, we now expect NSG to be approximately breakeven for the full year.
Micron recently announced their intent to call the IMFT factory. Our agreements with Micron ensure a reliable and cost-effective supply of 3D XPoint through at least 2020. And we have developed internal manufacturing options which can be executed well within that timeframe.
PSG's revenue came in at $496 million, up 6% on strength in data center and comm segments. PSG's data center segment was up 45% over last year. In the advanced products category, our 28-nanometer, 20-nanometer, and 14-nanometer solutions grew 55%. Operating profit was $106 million, down 6% year over year.
Finally, the Client Computing Group delivered exceptional results with its first $10 billion quarter, up 16% year over year. Commercial and gaming demand continued to be very strong. The notebook segment grew 13% year over year. The desktop segment grew 9% year over year. And client adjacencies grew 66% year over year, led by the 131% growth in our modem business. Operating profit grew $932 million year over year, while operating margin up 3.7 points. Leadership product performance and segmentation contributed to strong mix and higher ASPs.
The investments we have made in the business organically and through acquisition are delivering excellent cash flow generation. Year to date, we have generated $22.5 billion in cash from operations. We have invested $11.3 billion in capital expenditures and delivered $11.2 billion in free cash flow, up 57% over the first three quarters of last year. During this period, we returned 112% of our free cash flow to our shareholders. Buybacks totaled $8.5 billion and dividends totaled $4.2 billion. In addition, settlements of our convertible debt reduced fully diluted shares by 22 million.
Now turning to our full-year outlook, we started the year in January expecting to generate $65 billion in revenue, 30% operating margin, and $3.55 in EPS. Nine months later, the growth that we and the industry have seen has been remarkable. We couldn't be more pleased that in an increasingly competitive market, our customers are choosing Intel. Our leadership products are winning across our data-centric businesses, and we're seeing strong demand upside in the client business that not long ago many thought was in perpetual decline.
We are now forecasting revenue of approximately $71.2 billion, up $1.7 billion versus our expectations in July. This represents a $6.2 billion increase versus the expectations we set just nine months ago. We now expect data-centric growth to be approximately 20% year over year and PC-centric growth to be around 9% year over year.
Our outlook for operating margin is approximately 34.5%, up 2.5 points from July, as we now expect to deliver 29% spending to revenue, not only hitting our original goal two years early but beating it. We expect a full-year tax rate of around 12%, down slightly from our prior estimate.
Overall, we expect strong top line growth and improving operating leverage will drive EPS to $4.53, up $0.38 from our estimate in July. As a result of increased demand, we are raising our forecast for gross CapEx to $15.5 billion, or approximately $14 billion net of memory prepayments. We are now expecting free cash flow of $15.5 billion, up $500 million from July.
For Q4, we are forecasting revenue of approximately $19 billion, up 11% year over year. We expect operating margin of approximately 34.5% and gross margin of approximately 62%. We also expect EPS at $1.22, up 38% excluding equity adjustments from business growth, spending leverage, and a lower tax rate. We expect DCG to set another revenue record of approximately $6.3 billion in the fourth quarter. Due to supply constraints, we anticipate IOTG revenue will be down approximately 15% sequentially.
As we look forward to 2019, we expect to deliver another record year for the company. We'll have more to say about 2019 in January, but we're expecting that our operating margin percentage will be approximately flat next year. We expect gross margins to remain in the upper half of our historical 55% to 65% range.
While we expect 2019 gross margin percentage to be down slightly from Q4 2018 levels as we continue to gain share in our adjacent businesses and we ramp our 10-nanometer process, that will be offset by increasing OpEx leverage as we continue to make thoughtful trade-offs and invest in R&D that will accelerate our growth and profitability. And we expect the full-year tax rate to be up a couple points following several beneficial discrete events in 2018.
Five years ago, we set out to transform Intel from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company. Today, our strategy, our products, and our people are delivering on that ambition, with strong growth, record results, and the largest TAM opportunity in the company's history, and we're just getting started.
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark, and we'll get to your questions. Thank you.
Mark H. Henninger - Intel Corp.
All right, thank you, Bob. Moving on now to the Q&A, continuing with the practice that we began last quarter, we'll ask each participant to ask just one question if you have one. Operator, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan, your question please.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Good afternoon and congratulations on the solid quarterly execution. On the competitive front, with your nearest competitor rolling out its second-generation 7-nanometer server next product year, I guess the first question is, is the Intel team still on track to roll out its next-generation Xeon family, the Cascade Lake, at the end of this year? And if you could, just help us understand. What are some of the performance and portfolio differentiators that are going to help the team maintain relatively strong share in the service segment 2019 and beyond?
Venkata S. M. Renduchintala - Intel Corp.
Yeah, Harlan, this is Murthy. Let me take that one. Yes, you're correct. We still intend to be making first shipments of Cascade Lakes by Q4, and we're really excited with the stockpile of new features we have lined up for that platform, primarily the support of our Optane Persistent Memory that we will launch in conjunction with Cascade Lakes as we enter early 2019. We believe that will be a significant uplift in performance. We will also have dedicated instruction set extensions to support artificial intelligence workloads. And we'll have continued generation-over-generation CPU improvements.
So all in all, we think that Cascade Lake represents a power-packed addition to the data center roadmap. And of course, we have further excitement towards the end of next year as we launch our Cooper Lake platform as well. So we're really excited about the lineup we have in our DCG roadmap for next year and indeed, as you said, for the end of this quarter.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs, your question please.
Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great, thank you so much for taking the question. Bob, you've done a great job in managing OpEx since coming on board. You talked about further leverage into 2019. Can you remind us which areas of the business you're deemphasizing from a spending perspective? And how should we think about the balance between R&D and SG&A in 2019 and beyond? Thank you.
Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
Yeah first, I think that the progress we made has been a team sport. And as I indicated in the prepared remarks, we're down 700 basis points from 2015. And during that timeframe, it's not been at the expense of R&D. It's on the contrary, R&D has grown $1.4 billion during that timeframe. So really the underlying dynamics is we've made trade-offs to invest in higher growth segments of the business. That growth is in fact accelerating. And from that accelerating growth, we've been extremely disciplined on getting leverage on our SG&A, and we've exited some what I'd characterize non-core businesses. During the course of this year, we exited Wind River. We reduced our investments in wearables products, and we exited the Saffron business as well.
So as we go forward, we're going to continue to increase R&D, and we're going to increase it in the areas that we think can generate differentiated growth for us. And from that growth, we expect to continue to get leverage as we go into 2019.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse, your question please.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Yeah, good afternoon, Bob. Congratulations on the strong results. Bob, I wonder if you could just comment a little bit on when do you think the supply constraints will be over relative to your capacity addition plans. And if I caught it right, it sounds like in the calendar fourth quarter, you're choosing to shortchange the IoT Group. Does that mean that you're already caught up in the PC market, or how should we think about that dynamic?
Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
First, John, as we mentioned earlier, we were caught off guard a little bit this year by explosive growth well ahead of what our expectations were back in the beginning of the year, and that growth came from all different segments of the business. It put us in the unfortunate situation of constraining some of the demand signals that we were seeing from the market and our customer base.
In conjunction with our customers, our teams have done an outstanding job in the third quarter and we project into the fourth quarter, and that has enabled us to increase our revenue outlook for the year by $1.7 billion. But I think as we go into the fourth quarter, given the demand signals we continue to see across the business, we in fact will be constraining growth.
Our focus has been prioritizing, in conjunction with our customers, Xeon and Core processors. And therefore by definition, the lower end of PC and the IoT business is being constrained. So we are in a constraint scenario into the fourth quarter, both at low-end PC and IoT.
As we go into next year and the timing, we've put a lot of capital to work this year. It's a record year for CapEx for us at $15.5 billion. It's $1.5 billion higher than what we expected entering the year, and we have taken some of our 10-nanometer equipment and tools and began to blow that back to meet the increased demand for 14. So we're working extremely hard to get back on track in 2019. But at this stage of the game, given the demand signals we've seen in fourth quarter, we're going to be constrained a little bit. And we're trying to prioritize best as we can with our customers.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from Bank of Montreal, your question please.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Hi, thank you very much, Bob. Thanks actually for providing some color on 2019, but one area you did not touch on was CapEx. And I'm asking if you could provide us some directional input on that and what we should expect for CapEx, specifically in light of the Micron call option and implications that has for your spend on the memory side. Thank you.
Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
I think on CapEx at the macro level, as we think into 2019, we expect logic CapEx to likely be a little higher, and memory CapEx, despite building self-sufficiency on Optane, to be a little bit lower. So at the macro level, those are the dynamics.
In terms of how it plays out on overall levels, it's still a work in process, and I'd characterize it, Ambrish, this way. First, it's going to be a function of growth. As we get clearer around what growth looks like in 2019 for 14-nanometer, that will impact what the overall CapEx level is. Secondly, we've made some good progress on 10-nanometer yields over the course of the last six months. And as we progress through the fourth quarter and into 2019, if we're further ahead on 10-nanometer yields, that will influence the amount of CapEx next year.
Third, our progress on 7-nanometer, how well we progress on 7-nanometer also will influence how we think about CapEx. And last but not least, as it relates to memory, it's more the customer quals and adoption of our leading-edge 3D NAND 96-layer product. As we continue to make progress on developing that, we may deploy that capital, and that pays for itself very quickly.
So as we sit here today, CapEx, I expect logic to be up, memory to be down. And as we look at those four things, all which I'd characterize as being good things if we make progress on all four of those, that will influence the rate of CapEx spend next year. So we'll try to provide you a little more analytical color versus that qualitative color in January.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley, your question please.
Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great, thank you. I wanted to get – just give us a little bit more color on the PC numbers in the quarter. How much were you constrained by the shortages that you saw? And I guess it looks like you grew a little bit more than seasonal on a sequential basis. And how much of the ASP lift that you saw you think was a function of those shortages? And then just any color on could those shortages spread higher into this product stack over the course of Q4?
Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
Joe, I think as you saw from the IDC and Gartner folks, growth for PC TAM in the quarter probably around 1%. Our guess is it was probably a little bit stronger than that, 1% to 2% growth. And within that, we delivered 6% unit growth, so real strong unit growth and again good ASP momentum.
I would say in Q3, largely a function of customer collaboration in our fabs, I don't think we were too terribly constrained on the PC side, to be honest with you. I think as we're going into Q4 is where I think the constraints are impacting us a little bit more. So I don't think ASPs or supply constraints really benefit. We did not benefit from higher ASPs nor were we constrained in terms of unit growth in the quarter. It's more a fourth quarter thing where demand signals remain relatively strong. And as you saw from our guide, while it's good year-on-year growth, it's relatively flat overall on Q3 to Q4. And PCs, low-end PCs and IoT will be impacted as we see the demand signals at this stage of the game.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Weston Twigg from KeyBanc Capital Markets, your question please.
Weston David Twigg - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Sure, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask a little bit. I guess the demand is really good here in the back half of 2019. But with the trade war discussions, softening demand in China, some cycle risk indicators, are you seeing anything or talking to customers that would indicate that there would be any first half 2019 risk to demand?
Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
It's a great question. I think at the aggregate level, there is what I'd maybe characterize as some decent tailwinds as we exit the year and then go into 2019, but also some headwinds. The tailwinds, as you know, we've been talking about an expanded TAM where we play a bigger and bigger role in the increased needs for data. That larger TAM and the momentum we're building across all of our products is a pretty good tailwind as we look at just demand for data, whether it's with consumers or with businesses going into the new year. That's a tailwind.
Secondly, Murthy mentioned a few of the products that we have coming down the pike in the fourth quarter and going into next year. And those products we believe will deliver more and more performance for our clients, which I'd characterize as a tailwind.
And then third, in somewhat of a perverse way, as you know, when PC was 70% of the business and when enterprise was 50-plus percent of the Data Center business and those were declining, it was a headwind for the company's growth. But those more recently have been stable. So whether it's our expanded TAM, our new products, or the mix of our business, we have some tailwinds as we think about 2019.
At the same time, to your point, there are some headwinds. And the headwinds first, this has been a fantastic year for us and I think for the industry, and that just makes comps a little bit tougher as we go into next year. Second, we have growing competition. Growing competition can be a headwind for us. And our expectations are we'll deal with that pretty effectively.
And third, just global trade, in particular, as you know, China is a big market for us. We've got some important customers there, and it's an important part of our global supply chain. So as this most recent round of tariffs play out, and we're doing a lot of work with our customers to ensure that the global supply chain can be adjusted and adapted to deal with any tariffs that come down the way. But I think it's going to be a wait-and-see as we go into 2019.
At this stage of the game, we don't see any impact on 2018's results. And in 2019, we have what I consider a world-class supply chain team that can manage and weather the dynamics of changes in movement of goods better than anybody else in the industry. So I think that would be a competitive advantage for us as we go into next year.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Arcuri from UBS, your question please.
Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC
Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about DCG. You're not specifically guiding it next year, but it sounds like you're still pretty bullish. And there are a lot of investors I think worried about a hyperscale CapEx slowdown next year. So I guess is it that you're bullish on CapEx next year, or is it more a commentary on product cycle, maybe Xeon Scalable beginning to catalyze the server upgrade cycle? Thank you.
Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
I think firstly in terms of growth for next year in the aggregate, we haven't really provided any quantitative color, more qualitative color in terms of the dynamics that we see. That being said, our DCG growth this year is projected to be north of 20%, real strong through the first three quarters of the year. The fourth quarter we expect really solid demand. But it's on a much tougher comp because fourth quarter last year was a great quarter for the DCG business.
As we go into next year, we've got – Murthy highlighted we've got a good product roadmap of expanded features for Cascade Lake as we exit this year, Cooper Lake middle of next year. And we have a much more diverse business now, with obviously cloud has been a big accelerant for us. I don't expect that it will grow at 50% forever. 50% was our cloud growth in the quarter. But at the same time, our comms and networking business growth has been accelerating quite a bit, and the stability we've seen in enterprise and government has really helped.
So I think next year, we have a much more diverse business. We've got a good product lineup, and we'll provide a little more color as we get into January, but outstanding year this year for Data Center, both top line and bottom line.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank, your question please.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Bob, I wanted to ask on the gross margin side. First, thank you for the color you gave on 2019. But if I back it up a step, what's the headwinds in the fourth quarter sequentially? And then any big picture moving parts, 10-nanometer yields, mix, what have you, that gives you the confidence that you could still stay in the upper half of that 55% to 65% range for 2019?
Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
Yeah, great question. First, a little color on Q3, and then a walk from Q3 to Q4 dynamics. As we highlighted in the materials, almost 66% gross margin in the quarter is as high as it's been for a very long time, and it was a function of a few things: one, continued volume leverage with full factories; two, ASPs both on the client side and on the data center side. And those were partially offset by platform costs going up and changing mix, growth of our modem and memory business. So those are the four dynamics that played out during the course of the quarter.
I would say 66% was artificially high, and I'd say that for a couple reasons. One, we had, in the NSG business, we earned a government incentive that was from scaling our fabs outside the U.S. So that incentive was worth about $110 million, so a bit of a one-timer that we don't expect to repeat itself.
Secondly, sell-through of product either, on the CPU side, we are working with our customers and shaping demand to where we had inventory. We had good sell-through for some inventory that was previously partially reserved. And then second on our modem growth, our explosive modem growth in the quarter, we PRQ'd that product in the third quarter, so we got the benefit of previously fully reserved inventory. So what all that means when you adjust for one-timers, the 66% is closer to 64% in terms of a normalized basis going into the fourth quarter.
Our guide in the fourth quarter, to your question, is 62%. So there's really three dynamics that we see playing out in the fourth quarter. One, we expect ASPs to be better. And that's going to be a little bit of a function of the prioritization of Xeon and Core processors, which are higher ASP mix, so we expect that to benefit us.
But at the same time, there's three other things as we go into fourth quarter that I'd characterize as really good things, but will have an impact on our gross margin. One is ramping 10-nanometer. We're making good progress on 10-nanometer. Yields are improving, and that's giving us the confidence to in effect turn on more equipment and incur the depreciation cost associated with that. So that will impact our Q3 to Q4 gross margins. And it's a function of the progress we're making on 10-nanometer.
Second, memory continues to grow, good 21% growth in the third quarter. We expect it to continue to grow in the fourth quarter. And that has, our NAND business has been profitable during the course of the year but not at the gross margins of our logic business.
And then third, we're experiencing explosive growth on modem with some really good share gains. And the modem product is also – the combination of memory and modem are accretive to our year-on-year earnings growth but dilutive to our gross margins. So that's the Q3 adjusted gross margin going into Q4 will likely cost us roughly a couple points.
As we then step back and think about 2019, we see those same dynamics playing out, primarily 14-nanometer volume, so continued good yield, unit cost performance on 14-nanometer. We don't expect ASPs to be dramatically better in an increasingly competitive environment, but we don't expect them to be much worse. 10-nanometer costs will ramp, and we do expect to continue to grow memory and modem that will be accretive to earnings but a little dilutive to gross margin.
So again, a fairly long-winded walk from what drove Q3. The goodness operationally of what will happen to Q4 gross margins has been our comfort that 2019 will be modest degradation. But when coupled with the leverage on our operating expense, our operating margins will be roughly flat in the 34% range.

Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, your question please.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thanks for taking my question. Bob, just one more on 10-nanometer. You mentioned it's on track. Is there a way to quantify progress on 10-nanometer over the last three months? And if you were to go back to a similar time when you were getting ready to make the jump to 14-nanometer, are the 10-nanometer yields and costs behaving in a similar way? Just any color around progress would be helpful. Thank you.
Venkata S. M. Renduchintala - Intel Corp.
Hey, Vivek, let me take it. This is Murthy. First of all, as Bob said in his opening remarks, the progress we've made in the quarter is very much in line with our expectations. While we can't give any specific numbers, I do believe that the yields as we speak now are tracking roughly in line with what we experienced in 14-nanometer.
So we're still very much reinforcing and reaffirming our previous guidance that we believe that we'll have 10-nanometer shipping by holiday of 2019. And if anything, I feel more confident about that at this call than I did on the call a quarter ago. So we're making good progress and I think we're making the quarter-on-quarter progress that's consistent with prior generations having reset the progress curve.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch

Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Romit Shah from Nomura Instinet, your question please.
Romit Jitendra Shah - Nomura Instinet
Thank you and congratulations on the solid results. Bob, you said that progress on 7-nanometer will also be a factor driving CapEx next year, and I was hoping you could maybe talk about that a little bit more. When you talk about progress, is that a statement about yields, meaning if 7-nanometer yields are improving you could potentially deploy more CapEx to ramp that process node a little earlier?
Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
We haven't really given a timeline for 7-nanometer, so to say it's ramping earlier would be a little bit of a stretch. But we've been investing in EUV for a while, and we've obviously been investing in 7-nanometer. And when we step back and think about CapEx for next year, again, it's a function of growth on 14-nanometer. It's a function of the rate in which we scale 10-nanometer, and it's a function of investments we make to begin to prove out 7-nanometer in a more meaningful way. So those are just the dynamics that we're looking at and thinking about as we get closer to giving you a more definitive guide for CapEx in 2019.

Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
Thanks, Mark.
Our results for the quarter were outstanding, marking a record second quarter on our way to what we expect will be a record 2018. Last week we celebrated Intel's 50th year as a company, which is a big deal in an industry that never stops evolving. Even more remarkable is that after five decades in tech, Intel is poised to deliver its third year in a row of record financial performance.
We set a course five years ago to transform the company. To do that, we made investments to enhance and extend our core microprocessor business along with a series of bold bets to compete and win in new markets. Our thesis was that Intel is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the world's insatiable need to process, store, and move data.
The results have been dramatic. We are now competing for a $260 billion TAM, the largest in the company's history, and we have lots of room to grow. Just five years ago, roughly a third of our revenue was data-centric. Today, nearly half of our revenue is data-centric and growing at a double-digit rate. Data has never been more pervasive nor more valuable. In fact, 90% of the digital data ever created was generated in just the past two years. But of that data, only 1% has been analyzed, indicating massive untapped potential.
I'd like to highlight a few indicators of Intel's accelerating transformation before going into our financial results. First, in our Data Center business, our focus on the cloud, network transformation, and AI and analytics produced outstanding results in a strong demand environment. Customer preference for our highest performance products continued, with Xeon Scalable at nearly 50% of our mix in the second quarter. Cloud revenue grew as service provider CapEx continued to accelerate to meet the explosive demand for digital services, artificial intelligence, and data analytics. Enterprise revenue was driven by a combination of macro strength and companies increasing deployment of hybrid cloud solutions and data-intensive workloads.
In the comms service provider segment, we continued to gain share as customers choose to virtualize and transform their networks and prepare for the 5G transition using Intel architecture.
Our Programmable Solutions Group also delivered strong results this quarter. PSG again set a record for design win volume, indicating customers' confidence in our roadmap and growing adoption of FPGAs for workload acceleration from the data center, through the network, and out to the edge.
Earlier this month we announced the planned acquisition of eASIC, which will give us a competitive differentiator and another solution to meet customers' diverse time to market, performance, cost, and power needs.
We combined Intel and Altera 2.5 years ago, and we expected a key value driver to be the increasing use of FPGAs in the data center. In Q2, PSG's data center business more than doubled for the second consecutive quarter.
IoTG set an all-time revenue record, with particular strength in the retail and industrial sectors, as customers look to Intel not only for compute performance, but for solutions that drive business value. We also completed the sale of Wind River, as we continued to redeploy resources to higher growth and return areas.
Building on its industry leadership in ADAS and driving the industry toward and autonomous future, Mobileye set another all-time revenue record. Customer momentum continued with several design wins, including a multimillion unit deal with ZF for a large global automaker. We also announced that Baidu has adopted Mobileye's EyeQ-based Surround Computer Vision kit as the preferred vision solution for commercial Apollo Pilot AD [Autonomous Driver] deployments. In both the open source and commercial Apollo programs, Baidu will also integrate Mobileye's Responsibility Sensitive Safety model, an open and transparent model that provides safety assurance for AD decision-making, an industry imperative.
Our memory business also set an all-time revenue record. We are transforming the memory industry with a pair of differentiated platform connected capabilities, high-density floating-gate 3D NAND and high-performance persistent Optane technology. We recently announced that we are in production on the industry's first 4-bits per cell data center NAND PCIe SSDs. At the same time, industry support for Intel Optane DC-persistent memory continues to grow, with technology leaders, including CERN, Google, SAP, and Tencent already announcing plans for future use of the technology. Unlike traditional DRAM, Intel Optane DC-persistent memory will offer the unprecedented combination of high capacity, up to 3 terabytes per socket, along with affordability and persistence.
Intel and Micron recently announced that we will develop future generations of 3D Xpoint technology independently to better align the technology to our individual business needs and strategies. We'll continue to jointly manufacture 3D Xpoint at the Intel Micron Flash Technologies fab in Lehi [Utah]. Intel intends to extend its leadership with Intel Optane products based on 3D Xpoint, which combined with our high-density 3D NAND technology, offer the best solution for today's computing and storage needs.
And finally in client computing, our focus on innovation and differentiation in the commercial, enthusiast, and thin-and-light segments is producing results. Overall market conditions also continue to improve, and we now expect modest growth in the PC TAM this year for the first time since 2011. The commercial segment remains strong, as CIOs refreshing aging PC fleets are turning to Intel Core processors, with vPro as the gold standard for performance and manageability.
At the same time, consumer interest in gaming and our outright performance leadership are driving strength in the enthusiast segment, producing another outstanding quarter in gaming. These trends reflect the market's demand for our highest performance products, resulting in strong overall product mix in CCG. We also began shipping the 7560 modem, Intel's first CDMA and first multi-SIM-capable modem.
Our industry-leading products continue to deliver outstanding results. We have a leadership 14-nanometer product lineup for 2019, and we continue to make progress on 10-nanometer. Yields are improving consistent with the timeline we shared in April, and we expect systems on shelves for the 2019 holiday season.
In the second quarter, we announced a CEO change. The board is making good progress determining the best person to be the next CEO of this great company. While there is no timetable, the board is working with a sense of urgency, and the identification of candidates, both internal and external, is well underway.
Personally and on behalf of Intel's 100,000-plus employees, I'd like to thank Brian [Krzanich] for his many contributions to the company over his 35-year career. The investments he made set us on a course for transformation. Even more importantly, he developed the right strategy and leadership team to carry that transformation forward while we conduct the CEO search. Our financial results in the second quarter show we're doing just that.
Let's turn to the numbers. Revenue of $17 billion was up 15% year over year, marking a second record quarter. We saw strong performance across all of our businesses and record revenue in NSG, IoTG, and Mobileye.
Our data-centric businesses were collectively up 26%. Excellent operating margin leverage and a lower tax rate resulted in EPS of $1.04, up 44% year on year, even as we continued to invest for growth.
From a capital allocation perspective, year to date we have generated $6.3 billion of free cash flow, returned $8.6 billion to shareholders, including $2.8 billion in dividends and $5.8 billion in buybacks, repurchasing 117 million shares.
As a result of the continued strength we are seeing in the business, we are raising our full-year revenue guide by $2 billion to $69.5 billion. We are also raising our EPS guide by $0.30 versus April to $4.15 and the free cash flow guide by $0.5 billion to $15 billion.
Our leadership products are winning in an expanded TAM, and our data-centric businesses are now almost 50% of our total revenue. Our data-centric businesses had strong quarters, with each business individually growing at a double-digit rate. Our PC-centric business was up 6% on strength in the commercial and enthusiast segments.
Q2 was another quarter of significant EPS growth, up 44% year on year, and our operating margin expanded $1.4 billion and 5 points year on year. Our EPS improvement was driven by growing demand for high-performance products in the Data Center and Client businesses, leading to higher volumes and ASPs, strong growth in our adjacent businesses, a lower tax rate, and lower share count as a result of buybacks.
In January we pulled in our 30% spending goal to 2018, a full two years ahead of schedule. We are on track to meet that target, and our operating efficiency continues to improve. We remain extremely diligent in managing spending while prioritizing investments in areas that will accelerate revenue growth, product leadership, artificial intelligence, and autonomous driving. This focused approach is producing results.
Total Q2 spending came in at $5.1 billion, 30% of revenue. Total spending as a percentage of revenue is down 4.6 points year over year in the quarter, while we continued to increase investment in our key priorities. Versus the second quarter of last year, we delivered $2.2 billion more revenue with no incremental spending.
Let's talk now about our Q2 performance by segment. The Data Center Group delivered another great double-digit growth quarter, with revenue of $5.5 billion, up 27% year over year, and operating income of $2.7 billion, up 65%. Q2 operating margin was 49%, and we continued to see strong growth in both the cloud and comms service providers segments, which now make up two-thirds of DCG revenue. Platform unit volume was up 14% and ASPs were up 11%. Non-CPU adjacencies grew 30% over last year, yet another indicator that we are growing share in a larger data-centric TAM.
We saw continued broad-based demand strength this quarter, with customer preference for leadership products like Xeon Scalable driving strong mix. The cloud business, our largest Data Center segment, grew 41% year over year, as hyperscale CapEx expands to handle the explosive need to transmit, store, and analyze data.
Our comms service providers segment grew 30% year over year, as customers continue to choose Intel architecture to transform their networks. And our enterprise segment was up 10% year over year against a strong IT spending environment and prioritized investment in hybrid cloud implementations.
Our other data-centric businesses, IoTG, NSG, and PSG, also achieved double-digit growth in Q2 and together were up 22% year on year.
Our Internet of Things business achieved record volume and record revenue of $880 million, up 22% year over year, driven by strength in retail and industrial, as I mentioned earlier. Operating profit was $243 million, up 75% year over year, on higher revenue and flat spending. We expect the Wind River divestiture, which closed in the second quarter, will have a negative impact to IoT revenue of approximately $150 million in the second half of 2018.
Mobileye also had another strong double-digit growth in the quarter, up 37% over last year on increasing ADAS adoption.
Our memory business delivered more than $1 billion in revenue for the second quarter in a row, up 23% year over year. Optane gained momentum during the quarter, mostly on client strength, shipping over 1 million client Optane memory modules. We expect the memory segment to have full-year profitability in 2018, as we scale revenue and transition a higher percentage of our output to cost-effective 64-layer 3D NAND.
PSG's revenue came in at $517 million, up 18% in Q2, primarily from strength in the data center business. PSG's data center segment was up 140% over last year. In the advanced products category, our 28-nanometer, 20-nanometer, and 14-nanometer solutions grew 70%. Operating profit was $101 million, up 4% year over year.
Finally, the Client Computing Group continued to execute on all fronts with another outstanding quarter, generating $8.7 billion of revenue, up 6%.
Operating margin percent was flat year over year, as the customer preference for high-performance products drove a strong mix and higher ASPs, offset by 10-nanometer ramp cost. DCG continues to be an extremely important source of IP, scale, and cash flow for our company.
We are executing to our capital allocation priorities of investing organically, expanding acquisitively, and returning capital to our shareholders. Year to date, we generated $13.7 billion in cash from operations. We invested $7.4 billion in capital expenditures and delivered $6.3 billion in free cash flow, up 61% over the first half of last year. We returned well over 100% of our free cash flow to our shareholders. Buybacks totaled $5.8 billion, and dividends totaled $2.8 billion. In addition, settlements of our convertible debt reduced fully diluted shares by 12 million.
Shifting gears to our full-year outlook, our strategy is working, our products are winning, and our investments in data center growth are paying off. We are now forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $69.5 billion, up $2 billion versus our expectations in April. This represents a $4.5 billion increase versus the expectations we set in January. Product innovation, a strong global economy, and U.S. tax reform are spurring CIO investment in IT infrastructure, leading to higher data center demand and a stronger PC TAM.
We are seeing demand signals in supply feasibility to deliver on our revised expectations. Our biggest challenge in the second half will be meeting additional demand, and we are working intently with our customers and our factories to be prepared so we are not constraining our customers' growth.
Data Center growth is now expected to be approximately 20%, up from our April guidance of high teens. We now expect operating margin of approximately 32%, an increase of 1 point from April. We remain on track to our 30% spending goal, a full two years ahead of our original target. Gross margin is expected to be up slightly versus our April guidance on broad-based business strength. And we expect a full-year tax rate of roughly 12.5%, down slightly from our prior estimates.
Overall, we expect stronger top line growth, improved operating margins, and stronger demand will boost EPS to $4.15, up $0.30 from our estimate in April. In response to the stronger demand, we are raising gross CapEx $0.5 billion to $15 billion, or $13 billion net of memory prepayments. And we are now expecting free cash flow of $15 billion, up $0.5 billion from April. And we expect free cash flow per share as a percentage of EPS to improve by more than 10 points over last year. We remain intensely focused on closing the gap between free cash flow and EPS and expect to make more progress next year.
For Q3, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $18.1 billion, up 12% year over year. We expect operating margin of approximately 34%, flat versus last year, which reflects about a 1 point decrease in gross margin and a roughly 1 point decline in spending. We also expect EPS at $1.15, up 31% excluding equity adjustments, from stronger top line growth, spending reductions, and a lower tax rate.
Again, last week we celebrated our 50th anniversary and reflected on the impact Intel and our ecosystem partners have had on the world. It has been nothing short of extraordinary. At the same time, we are even more excited about the role Intel will play in technology's future. We're laser-focused on Intel's opportunity, which is larger than it has ever been. Intel's inventiveness, architectural innovation, manufacturing expertise, and intense drive have allowed the company to create and capitalize on opportunity over the long haul.
From the early days of DRAM to the era of the first microprocessors, from one architectural battle to the next, and from the PC to the Internet to the cloud, Intel has grown and thrived. I'm very excited about what lies ahead for the company.
With that, let me turn it over to Mark and we'll get to your questions. Thank you.
Mark H. Henninger - Intel Corp.
All right. Thank you, Bob. Moving on to the Q&A, in order to accommodate broader participation on the call, we would request that each participant limit themselves to just one question. Operator, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.

Move on, okay. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, your question please.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thanks for taking my question. Bob, on 10-nanometer progress, any color on what these are doing? And systems you mentioned on shelf for second half 2019, I assume that's mostly PC Client. Any sense of when we can think of timing for your server products on 10-nanometer also?
Venkata S. M. Renduchintala - Intel Corp.
Hi, this is Murthy. I'll take that one. We continue to make progress on 10-nanometer. Yields are improving consistent with the timelines we shared in April. And yes, you're quite right. The systems on shelves that we expect in holiday 2019 will be client systems, with data center products to follow shortly after.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you.
Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
So good progress on 10-nanometer and what we think is a very good lineup on 14-nanometer product for next year on both client and server that we think will deliver best-in-class performance as we continue to ramp 10-nanometer.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research, your question please.
Pierre C. Ferragu - New Street Research LLP (US)
Hi, thank you for taking my question, a quick follow-up on 10-nanometer. When I look at this timeline between now and the Christmas season next year, it's 18 months. It's a very long time to improve your yield. And I have two questions on this one. The first one is, could you give us some color on what are the most challenging aspects of the process that you need to address to improve use? What's the most challenging in the 10-nanometer process? And then my second question is how do you think about the impact of these delays on your competitiveness? Where do you think it's going to hurt you the most?
Venkata S. M. Renduchintala - Intel Corp.
So let me take that. I think as we look at what we need to do in 10-nanometers, again, let me replay some of the data we shared on our April call. Recall that 10-nanometers strive for a very aggressive density improvement target beyond 14-nanometers, almost 2.7x scaling. And really, the challenges that we're facing on 10-nanometers is delivering on all the revolutionary modules that ultimately deliver on that program. And while there's risk and a degree of delay in our timeline on that, we're very pleased with the resiliency of our 14-nanometer roadmap, where in the last few years we've delivered in excess of 70% product performance improvement as we've moved through our 14-nanometer generation of products.
So as we look at 2019 across both the client and data center space, we feel very good about the product competitiveness of our 14-nanometer program, and that to some degree is factoring into our timing on 10-nanometer and launching 10-nanometer at a point in time where we believe the yields are at a level that make it prime for volume production. So 14-nanometer I think through the rest of this year and through 2019 continues, we believe, to drive product leadership across all our portfolio in client and server.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse, your question please.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Good afternoon, guys. Bob, thanks for letting me ask a question. Just relative to your data center expectations now for the full year, I'm just curious. What's been the biggest driver? You're decelerating to mid-teens in the back half of the year, which is still very impressive. And I guess as you talk about the question, and maybe Navin can chime in. Once again, enterprise is much better than expected. And the 10% growth I think is what you referenced year over year in the June quarter. To what extent is that going to be more sustainable as you look into the second half of the year and into 2019?
Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
Thanks, John. I'll start and then have Navin chime in. Q2 data center growth was outstanding. We started when we talked to you back in April, we started the quarter out strong. The middle of the quarter was strong, and the end of the quarter was strong. So 27% top line growth for data center, we feel very good about it and see that momentum continuing into the second half of the year.
As you know, Q4 last year was an outstanding year, so we have slightly tougher comps in the fourth quarter, but we're looking at real strong growth for the full year. And as I indicated earlier, the strength was across the board, cloud up over 40%, comms services up 30%. And specifically to your question, enterprise strength continues, not only volume, but the trajectory of Xeon Scalable and the adoption of Xeon Scalable has accelerated a little bit beyond what we expect to drive real good ASPs.
So real good first half, strong outlook for the second half across the board, and then slightly tougher comps as we go into Q4.
Navin Shenoy - Intel Corp.
The only thing I'd add to that, John, is that the demand is broad-based across all the segments that Bob talked about. And it's also broad-based in terms of our product portfolio. Xeon Scalable we launched about a year ago. And it crossed over or getting close to crossing over at about 50% of our volume, so a lot of room still to go on Xeon Scalable as we look forward.
And as I think about the product portfolio beyond Xeon Scalable, you might have seen this week at the Google Next show, Google talked about adopting the Optane Persistent Memory DIMM, so we have that product portfolio ahead of us in the second half. And then our next-generation Xeon will begin to ramp in the early part of 2019.
So general macroeconomic all-segment growth, people applying information technology to handle their data problems combined with a very strong product portfolio as we look forward.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research, your question please.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Bernstein Research
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess one question. I wanted to ask about gross margins. Your full-year guide implies a very significant deceleration of gross margins in Q4, like 300 bps sequentially, down to about 59%. Can you talk about what's driving that sequential decline from Q3 to Q4? And do those drivers sustain into 2019? For example, is it 10-nanometer or mix or whatever? Can you give us some color on what's going on there please?
Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
Thanks, Stacy. First, I think the first half to second half dynamics, we're looking at an operating margin improvement by 1.5 to 2 points, so we see good solid op margin growth first half to second half. The dynamics are the gross margin we expect to come down a bit and be more than offset by good volume leverage on a relatively stable spending base. So that trend of modest gross margin erosion more than offset by spending leverage driving op income improvement is the trends that you've been seeing for the last six to eight quarters, and we expect that to continue into the second half of the year.
When you look at – implied in our guide for Q4 in particular, a couple things going on. One, accelerating growth of modem as we go through the second half of the year, accelerating growth of NSG or memory as we go through the second half of the year. We haven't assumed the continued strong ASP performance that we've seen through the first half. We hope that turns to be conservative, but we'll see how that plays out. And then lastly, to your point and Murthy mentioned earlier, we're ramping up 10-nanometer to improve the yield. So that's going to weigh on gross margins for the fourth quarter as well.
So all things involved, we feel good about op margin expansion. We're up 500 basis points in the quarter. We'll be up another couple points first half to second half. But the gross margin dynamics will weigh on us in the fourth quarter, and spending will more than offset it.
As we go into 2019, I think the way we've been running the business for the last few years, we have dramatically expanded our TAM. And with that TAM, we see more and more opportunities to invest and grow, and that growth is driving improved earnings for the company. At the same time, some of that growth has lower gross margins. But that expanded TAM, the higher revenue growth on a very well controlled spending base is expanding our op income dollars and our earnings per share. So we feel pretty good about where we are as we exit 2018 and head into 2019 in terms of operating income for the business. Thanks, Stacy.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank, your question please.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question, I wanted to go back to the DCG side of things. Obviously, the 27% year-over-year growth in 2Q is very impressive in both its magnitude and its breadth. But I get a ton and an increasing amount of questions about competition, whether it's direct competition on the x86 CPU side of things, or if it's more indirect competition for a greater TAM from accelerators and FPGAs and the GPU compute, those sorts of things.
So, I don't know if it would be Murthy or Navin, but I'd love to hear how you guys are looking at competition, and if you've taken the 10-nanometer aspect of competition and 7-nanometer for those folks off the table. Talk about the design side, where you think you can take share or there might actually be some pressure, and in general, how Intel reacts 4to the optimism we're hearing from a number of your aspiring new entrants.
Navin Shenoy - Intel Corp.
Sure, I'll take that. It's Navin here. Look, we feel great about our competitive position. We came into 2018 expecting a competitive environment. And against that backdrop, you've seen the results we've delivered over the last two or three quarters. This was our third consecutive quarter above 20% growth.
And really that reflects our investments that we've made over several years. We have a leadership roadmap, not just in CPUs but in, as you pointed out, a broad set of additional silicon, from ASICs to FPGA to silicon photonics to memory. And our approach really has been to over time increasingly stitch all of those assets together to deliver a better solution for our customers. And that really sets us apart from everyone that we're competing with, where one or another may have one of those solutions but very few have – in fact, none have that broad portfolio that we've been pursuing.
So we are going to be aggressive and competing. We're going to have to go out and earn the business, just like we always have every day, every week, every month. And as I look at our roadmap now and as I look at our roadmap in the second half and as I look at our roadmap into 2019, I'm very confident that we continue to maintain that leadership on that broad portfolio of products. So we're set up for a great second half and another strong growth year as we head into 2019.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great, thank you.
Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
The one thing I'd add, Ross, is on the accelerator side, particularly the FPGAs, 18% growth for FPGAs in the quarter, and as we mentioned earlier, real strong penetration in data center. So that growth has been fueled by 140% increase in PSG in the data center environment. So I think, Navin, if I could, had a choice to make when he took over in the Data Center business, and it was protect our large microprocessor share or dramatically expand the market and both protect our share as well as participate in a much bigger market, and that's how he and the team have been focused. And that's resulted in both protection of CPUs but expansion of share and a much broader TAM. So again, I'd just close with we feel great about what the team is doing in expanding the role we play in the data center and at the edge.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays, your question please.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hey, thanks for taking my question. I just want to ask you about 7-nanometer. You mentioned 10-nanometer and timing there, and I don't expect you to put a date out there for 7-nanometer. So maybe you could talk about what you've learned on 10-nanometer, how you're applying it to 7-nanometer, and any indications of that development, how it's going.
Venkata S. M. Renduchintala - Intel Corp.
Sure. Blayne, so 7-nanometer is very much R&D in deep progress, and we're making good progress on that development. We're not giving a direct timeline right now. But we've also made some fairly judicious choices in defining 7-nanometer, learning from our 10-nanometer experiences. And we're focusing on an optimum balance point between density, power and performance, and schedule predictability. So I think what you'll see is a more balanced approach across those three vectors.
So we're still going to drive density but balancing that with a continued focus on driving transistor performance at the same time, which is highly valued as ASP drivers both in our client and server businesses. And we're really also focusing on being much more precise in our ability to launch. So those are the key learnings that are coming out of 10-nanometer as we go into 7-nanometer. And as we monitor progress on 7-nanometer just as closely as we are on 10-nanometer, I feel those lessons are being well absorbed into our progress, and we're lining up to support our product plans as our roadmap dictates.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS, your question please.
Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks very much. I actually wanted to go back to the question about gross margins in Q4. And I wanted to see if you could segment out the pieces because it seems like the modem piece could maybe be a 200 basis point hit just by itself. So I wondered if you could maybe segment out some of the pieces between 10-nanometer, between the modem, and between ASP. Thank you.
Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
I presume by segment out, you mean quantify, and my answer will probably be unfulfilling if that's the case, but I think you hit on the three things. As we go into – as we enter the second half and the fourth quarter in particular, we see modem accelerating. We have a great product that's getting good traction in the modem space, so that product is accelerating, and that obviously has margins a little lower, NSG growth accelerating going into the fourth quarter, those margins are a little bit lower, 10-nanometer ramping, and that will weigh on gross margins. And lastly, just our outlook for ASPs, ASP has been a significant contributor to our high gross margin performance over the last couple quarters. Now we've assumed that it won't stay at those levels.
So those are the four components of segmentation. And then I'd just go back to with this high growth, we're getting really good leverage and expect our operating margins to improve as we go to the back half of the year.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley, your question please.
Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great, thank you. I was wondering. With DCG, you guys have had an 11% ASP increase, and I know there's a lot of noisiness to that. But it's about double what you've averaged over the last few years. Is that a Purley effect? And if so, do you anniversary that and have less of an ASP increase going forward? Just how should I think about the price increases you've seen on average?
Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
Joe, the ASP strength that we've seen actually really most of this year is a reflection of what we see our customers doing across the board. All of them are buying our highest performance products. There's this insatiable appetite for performance on all the workloads that they're looking at.
Certainly we did expect the transition to Purley to be accretive to us from an ASP point of view. But if I look at our broad portfolio of products, our ASPs look very good. And year on year our ASPs look good in the other parts of our products as well, Broadwell for example. So in general, we're just seeing an almost insatiable appetite for the best products, the highest performing products that we have, and I don't see that slowing down as I look forward.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO, your question please.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Hi, thank you. Bob, I just wanted to go back to the comments you were making as you were concluding your prepared remarks about demand challenges in the second half. Is that specific to client, servers? And where is that coming from? And then more importantly, does that open up another – or a window for a competitor to wedge in and take some share from you? Thank you.
Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
When we started the year, our outlook for the year was $65 billion in revenue. And six months through the year, given strong demand, across the board actually, both servers and PCs, real strong demand had us raise our outlook by $4.5 billion for the year. So we feel very good about the demand signals we see at the $69.5 billion level. We feel very good about having the supply in place for that fairly significant demand increase.
And now as we go to the back half of the year, to the extent demand continues to increase, which I'd say it has almost month to month the first six months of the year, we need to work with our customers and our fabs to make sure that we continue to have the capacity to fill demand to the extent that it rises beyond the $69.5 billion level.
So we're working closely with our customer base, both on the server and the PC side, and very closely with our internal teams to make sure we're not a constraint to the extent that demand in the second half of the year continues to go up like it has through the first six months of the year, and just to fill that demand along the way and not give others the opportunity to fill it for us.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely from Citigroup, your question please.
Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thanks, guys, just a quick one on the DCG op margins. So data center rev was up sequentially, but the op margins were down. I think you talked about the 10-nanometer yield issues. Was that all that was going on there? And so essentially, are DCG operating margins capped at this 49% and change level? And when are these 10-nanometer headwinds going to go away and reverse and start to become tailwinds?
Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
So just to maybe repeat, 27% top line growth and 65% operating income growth with an 11 point improvement in operating margins year on year. So outstanding performance on product margin, as Navin indicated, particularly with strong ASP performance. Our margins have continued to improve, and I'd just say not at the expense of curtailing investments for our data center business. We see real good growth opportunities and we continue to invest, so really good expansion in margin performance while continuing to invest.
In terms of 10-nanometer, that is more – again, with client being first on 10-nanometer, they are more feeling the effect of the 10-nanometer on their margins. That's relatively de minimis effect for the DCG business.
Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Okay. Thanks, Bob.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland from Susquehanna, your question please.
Christopher Rolland - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Hey, Murthy, you might have actually answered this with your ""shortly after"" comment. But given some competitive threats in server in particular, are you guys thinking that you might ramp 10-nanometer server more quickly than you traditionally would after PC?
Venkata S. M. Renduchintala - Intel Corp.
In general, we're going to see a much shorter ramp period between our products going forward in client and server. So yes, I think it's a good observation that as we talk about client systems on shelf by the second half of 2018, you shouldn't expect too much of a delay before you see data center products coming out.
So much closer proximity, albeit slightly delayed than we expected on 10-nanometer, and then you should see that pretty much improve to almost parity of launches as we get into later technologies. So the traditional model of server following rather lengthily after client is probably going to become more sequential going forward.
Christopher Rolland - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Very interesting, thanks.

Thank you. Our next question, we have C.J. Muse from Evercore back in the queue. Your line is now open.
C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI
Great, thanks for taking my questions. Sorry about the gaffe earlier. A question for you on your evolving manufacturing strategy. It sounds like as opposed to copying exactly, we're moving to a world where you would consider building both 14-nanometer and 10-nanometer in the same factory. So curious what the implications of such a move are to gross margins and capital intensity as we look ahead.
Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
I think obviously from node to node over the last several nodes, frankly, the capital intensity of the business with each node has increased over time. At the same time, the amount of reuse of equipment and tools from one node to the next is extremely high. So with the exception of particularly 10-nanometer going to 7-nanometer, litho changing quite a bit with EUV, with each node, even with more capital intensity, we have relatively high reuse and we can leverage the tools for longer and longer.
So in terms of implications on gross margin, I'd just say it's a function of product leadership and maintaining that product leadership. And Navin talked about how customers are looking for high performance, and the ASPs associated with that high performance allows us to continue to generate extremely attractive gross margins despite increased capital intensity as you go to each node.
C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI
That's very helpful, thank you.
Venkata S. M. Renduchintala - Intel Corp.
I just wanted to add to Bob's perspective. The way I look at our roadmap, what we're really focused on is delivering product leadership generation after generation, and that's the system level. And while processes are a very important part of that recipe, so are the other ingredients as well, such as product architecture, silicon design, and packaging.
And to Bob's point, as we look towards our roadmap, gross margin maximization is going to come from delivering excellence that drives performance, and therefore we're taking a very balanced view in all the ingredients that go into that. So you should expect in our roadmap going forward a much longer overlap between generations of technology as we try and make sure that, along with process, we add the other ingredients of technology leadership that will become more and more apparent.
Mark H. Henninger - Intel Corp.
C.J., thank you. And, operator, I think we have time for two more questions.

Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy from Stifel, your question please.
Kevin Edward Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Thanks for taking my question. Just looking at gross margin for the longer term, you named the four components. And as we look beyond fourth quarter, does modem gross margins improve, and is 10-nanometer less of a drag in the future? And can you frame it how long that would be?
Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
Yes, first we've been – our gross margin performance has been very strong, in the upper end of our long-term gross margin target, so we feel pretty good about where gross margins sit today.
In terms of modem in particular, yes, we do expect to improve gross margins for our modem business, both with our 7560 product that will begin to ship in the second half. But also as we migrate to a 5G world, we expect margins in the modem business to continue to improve. So yes, we expect modem profitability to improve. We don't see it at the 60-plus percent gross margin level, but we do expect it to be a contributor to earnings performance as we go forward.

Thank you. Our final question for today comes from the line of Tristan Gerra from Baird, your question please.
Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Hi, good afternoon. So looking at the fact that you're ramping for the first time a very high-volume on non-x86 architecture, what are the longer-term implications of something that you haven't discussed much more recently, which is the custom foundry business for the medium term?
Venkata S. M. Renduchintala - Intel Corp.
Again, while we haven't talked about it that much, the custom foundry aspects of our business still remain very strategically important to us. We believe that as we continue to explore growth and partnership opportunities in our data-centric businesses, the ability to develop custom silicon products together with our customers is going to become increasingly important.
So as we see our customer relationships going forward, you'll probably see a lot more co-developed products using Intel process technology in order for their delivery and their interworking with the product portfolio that Navin talked about. So custom products through a custom foundry relationship remain a strategically important part of our customer engagement portfolio.
Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Great, thank you.

Thanks, Mark.
Coming off a record 2017, 2018 is off to an exceptionally strong start. Q1 was Intel's best first quarter ever and significantly exceeded the expectations we set in January. Our Client Computing Group continued to execute well, producing growth within a declining PC market. And our transformation to a data-centric company accelerated, with our data-centric businesses, including McAfee, up 25% over the first quarter of last year.
The strength of Intel's business underscores my confidence in our strategy. What we're seeing is an unrelenting demand for compute performance, driven by the continuing growth of data and the need to process, analyze, store, and share that data. That dynamic benefits our traditional CPU business, and it reinforces the big bets we've made in memory, modems, FPGAs, and autonomous vehicles. We're competing to win in our largest collection of addressable markets ever. And importantly, we're not just competing in these markets. We're leading and shaping them, as our first quarter results demonstrate.
Data Center Group revenue was up 24% year over year. We saw broad-based demand strength across all DCG segments in Q1. And customer preference for high-performance products, including Xeon Scalable, drove a richer ASP mix. The cloud segment grew 45%. And in the comm service provider segment, we continued to take share and grew revenue 33%, as customers chose IA-based solutions to virtualize and transform their networks as the industry prepares for the 5G transition.
Intel's presence at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang was a powerful showcase of our 5G capability. Intel and KT deployed the world's largest 5G network to date, including more than 20 5G links, delivering 3,800 terabytes of network capacity. We've established leadership in 5G. And when commercial networks begin deploying around 2019, we'll be there with industry-leading products, from the core of the data center to the edge to mobile devices.
And we also saw growth in our enterprise segments for the second consecutive quarter, as macro strength continued and customers prioritized hybrid and on-premises infrastructure investments.
Data center customers are also looking to FPGAs for workload acceleration. The Programmable Solutions Group again set a record for design win volume, and those design wins are translating directly into revenue. PSG's business grew 17% in Q1 on data center and embedded strength along with last-time buys. PSG's data center segment was up 150% over last year. And the advanced products category, our 28, 20 and 14-nanometer solutions, grew more than 40%.
Microsoft also recently announced that they're using Intel's FPGAs to power new Bing Intelligent Search features using real-time AI. PSG's momentum is evidence that our 2016 acquisition of Altera is delivering value for our customers and contributing directly to Intel's growth.
Our IOTG [Internet of Things Group] business grew 17% on record unit volume, with continuing momentum in the retail and video segments, as compute increasingly moves to the edge. Consistent with our commitment to be disciplined with our resources, we made the decision to divest Wind River and sharpen the focus of IOTG on other growth opportunities that more closely align to our strategy.
The memory business set a revenue record, growing 20% in the first quarter, crossing over the $1 billion mark in revenue. The last business that passed that mark was DCG, crossing over that mark over a decade ago. Both yields and output in our Dalian factory continue to ramp ahead of schedule. In fact, we believe the Dalian fab expansion is one of the fastest brownfield wafer starts projects in memory industry history.
We also launched our first mainstream Optane SSDs for clients, known as the 800 Series, driving further industry adoption of this revolutionary technology. The NSG remains on track to be profitable for the full year.
And we continued to demonstrate momentum in autonomous driving, and I'm happy to report that the Intel Mobileye autonomous vehicle test fleet has begun to operate in Israel and will expand to other geographies in the coming months. Our fleet fully implements the Responsible-Sensitive Safety system, or RSS, that we introduced last year. This unique system applies a formal common-sense safety seal to the vehicle's decision-making, resulting in the optimal combination of provable safety and human-like driving style.
We believe that the winning path to autonomous driving will be a progression from ADAS capabilities to full autonomous driving. And we're seeing significant momentum in the marketplace, including a recent high-volume design win for EyeQ5 with a European premium vehicle manufacturer.
And finally, the Client Computing Group extended its strong track record of execution in a challenging PC environment. Revenue was up 3% despite a declining PC TAM, on strength in the commercial and enthusiast segments, leading to a strong Core mix. The CCG launched its first-ever i9 processors for laptops in the first quarter, again demonstrating our outright product leadership.
We continue to make progress on our 10-nanometer process. We are shipping in low volume and yields are improving, though the rate of improvement is slower than we anticipated. As a result, volume production is moving from the second half of 2018 into 2019. We understand the yield issues and have defined improvements for them, but they will take time to implement and qualify. We have leadership products on the roadmap that continue to take advantage of 14-nanometer, with Whiskey Lake for clients and Cascade Lake for the data center coming later this year.
Moore's Law is central to our strategy and our product leadership. It continues to create significant value for Intel and our customers. While it's taking longer and costing more to deliver and yield advanced process technologies, we are able to optimize our process and products within the node to deliver meaningful performance improvements.
For example, 14-nanometer process optimizations and architectural improvements have resulted in performance gains of more than 70% since the first 14-nanometer products were launched. We combine these advances in manufacturing technology and architecture to produce truly leadership products. And it's that product leadership that ultimately matters most to our customers and end users.
Intel and the industry stepped up to a tough challenge as we responded to the security vulnerabilities known as Spectre and Meltdown. I'm pleased with our progress and proud of how Intel and industry partners addressed this issue collaboratively with transparency and with customer-first urgency. We're delivering against our security-first pledge and we've now rolled out micro code-based mitigations for all Intel products launched over the last nine years that require protection against Spectre and Meltdown. We'll also begin delivering both client and data center products with hardware-based mitigations later this year.
With our data center transformation accelerating, we're raising our expectations for our full-year results, yet more evidence that our strategy is working. As Intel marks its 50th anniversary, we're well positioned to be the end-to-end platform provider for the new data world and a leader in artificial intelligence and the autonomous revolution.
With that, let me hand it over to Bob.
Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
Thanks, Brian.
Q1 was truly an outstanding start to 2018. Our transformation to a data-centric company continues to build momentum. Revenue was a first quarter record at $16.1 billion, up 13% year over year. Operating income was $4.8 billion, up 21% year over year, and EPS at $0.87 was up 32% year over year. From a capital allocation perspective, we generated $6.3 billion of cash flow from operations and returned $3.3 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends.
As a result of the strength we are seeing in the business, we are raising our full-year revenue guide by $2.5 billion to $67.5 billion. We're raising our EPS guide by $0.30 to $3.85, and we're raising our free cash flow guide by $1.5 billion to $14.5 billion.
Our Q1 results demonstrated continued momentum in our transformation from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company. Intel's data-centric businesses were up 25% collectively, with each business individually growing double digits. Our data-centric businesses are now approaching 50% of our revenue, an all-time high. Our PC-centric business was up 3% on strength in notebook, desktop, and modem. DCG's strong cash flows fund Intel's investments in new data-centric growth.
As a reminder, we adopted a new revenue recognition standard in Q1. The new standard drove $462 million in incremental Q1 revenue recognition. This predominantly affected CCG and NSG. By year end, we expect roughly half of this to net out.
Moving to Q1 earnings, we generated significant EPS expansion in the quarter, up 32% year on year. Our non-GAAP EPS improvement was driven by strong top line growth, a 3-point improvement in operating margins, and an 11-point reduction in our effective tax rate. The 3-point improvement in operating margins were driven by a 4-point reduction in spending, partially offset by a 1-point decline in gross margin. The 1-point decline in gross margin was driven by growth in our adjacencies, which have lower gross margins than our CPU products. From a spending standpoint, versus last year, we delivered $1.3 billion more revenue on $200 million less spending.
As a second reminder, we adopted a new mark-to-market standard for our equity investments. In 2017, all realized gains and losses were recorded in our non-GAAP results. But in 2018, all mark-to-market adjustments flow through earnings. In an effort to eliminate volatility, we have excluded these adjustments from our non-GAAP results. Our Q1 GAAP EPS included approximately $0.13 for mark-to-market gains in our ICAP portfolio that were excluded from our non-GAAP results.
We are also making excellent progress on our operating efficiencies. In January, we pulled in our 30% spending goal from 2020 to 2019, and we're off to a good start in 2018. Total spending was down 4% year over year in the quarter. R&D spending as a percentage of revenue was down approximately 2 points. And our SG&A costs were down over 2 points.
Our intensity on spending is designed to accelerate top line growth, and it is paying off. Currently, as a result of strong top line growth, we now expect to meet our 30% spending target in 2018, two years ahead of our original expectations.
Let me touch briefly on our Q1 performance by segment. The Data Center Group delivered a great quarter, much better than expected. DCG revenue of $5.2 billion was up 24% year over year, and operating income of $2.6 billion grew 75%. Q1 operating margin was 50%. Overall, unit volume was up 16% and ASPs were up 7%.
We saw broad-based demand strength in Q1, with customer preference for high-performance products driving richer ASPs. Cloud and comm service provider segments were greater than 60% of the data center business. And this was the first quarter our cloud business has surpassed $2 billion in revenue, which made it our largest segment in the first quarter.
Additionally, we redefined our expanded TAM for DCG to markets beyond the CPU, like silicon photonics, fabric, network ASICs, and 3D XPoint memory. These adjacent businesses are gaining traction and grew 16% year over year. DCG performance in all segments was better than our January forecast, and we expect that strength to continue to aid DCG momentum through the second quarter.
Our additional data-centric businesses, IOTG, NSG, and PSG, are becoming a larger component of our overall business, growing 18% year over year in the quarter. Our Internet of Things business achieved revenue of $840 million, growing 17% year over year, driven by strength in video and continued momentum in retail. Operating profit was $227 million, up 116% year over year, on higher revenue and lower spending, as we shifted our ADAS investments to Mobileye. As you heard from Brian, the Mobileye business is going strong. Q1 revenue was $151 million. And while it's early in the journey, we are on track to our deal thesis.
Our memory business broke $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time, up 20% year over year, with strong demand for data center SSD solutions. We reduced our operating losses by $48 million, with strong gigabyte demand and unit cost reductions more than offsetting ASP reductions.
The transition to 64L 3D NAND is improving our cost while we invest in and expand our Dalian factory. We expect the second half of 2018 to be balanced between supply and demand, and we continue to expect this segment to be profitable for the full year of 2018.
The Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $498 million, with 17% growth, driven by strength in data center and the embedded segments. Operating profit was $97 million, up 5% year over year. The PSG team continues to perform and execute well. Our advanced FPGA products, those at 28, 20, and 14-nanometer, grew over 40% in the quarter. In fact, PSG won more customer designs in Q1 than in any prior quarter.
Finally, the Client Computing Group had another strong quarter. Revenues of $8.2 billion were up 3%, and operating margins were down 4 points due to 10-nanometer transition costs and growth in our modem business. Our PC-centric business continues to perform well in a challenging but improving market and serves as a significant source of cash flow for the company. We saw strength in the commercial and gaming businesses, and we believe the worldwide PC supply chain is operating at healthy levels.
We've laid out our capital allocation priorities: invest organically; expand acquisitively; and return capital to our shareholders and do it wisely. We continued to execute to these priorities. We generated $6.3 billion in cash from operations. This included $1.7 billion in cash received from NAND customer supply agreements. We invested $2.9 billion in CapEx and delivered $3.4 billion in free cash flow, up 73% year over year. We returned almost 100% of free cash flow to our shareholders in the form of $1.9 billion in buybacks and $1.4 billion in dividends, a 10% increase per share over last year.
Now moving to our full-year outlook, our strategy is working and our investments are paying off. We are now forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $67.5 billion, up $2.5 billion versus our expectations in January. We expect operating margin of approximately 31%, up 1 point from January, as spending as a percent of revenue drops to approximately 30%. Versus prior estimates, gross margin will be approximately flat, as broad-based strength in our business is offset by the higher costs associated with the 10-nanometer volume production shift to 2019. We now expect a full-year tax rate of 13%, 1 point down versus our prior estimates.
Overall, stronger top line growth, improved operating margins, and a lower tax rate will boost EPS to $3.85, up $0.30 versus prior estimates.
From a cash flow perspective, we are increasing our free cash flow to $14.5 billion, up $1.5 billion from January. We now expect net capital deployed of approximately $12.5 billion, up $500 million versus the expectations we set in January. This reflects gross CapEx of approximately $14.5 billion, offset by approximately $2 billion of customer prepayments for memory supply agreements.
In Q2, we expect strong growth to continue. We are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $16.3 billion, up 10% year over year. We expect operating margin of approximately 30%, up 1 point versus last year, which reflects approximately 1.5-point decrease in gross margin and a 2.5 to 3-point decline in spending. We expect EPS of $0.85, up 31%, excluding equity adjustments, from strong top line growth, spending reductions, and a lower tax rate.
To sum it up, we believe 2018 will be another record year for Intel. We've met and exceeded our financial commitments, and we feel great about where we are relative to our 3-year plan. Our PC-centric team keeps winning in a challenging market and our data-centric businesses are growing fast, fueling Intel's transformation to a company that powers the cloud and smart connected devices.
With that, let me turn it over to Mark, and we'll get to your questions.
Mark H. Henninger - Intel Corp.
All right. Thank you, Brian and Bob. Moving on now to the Q&A, as is our normal practice, we would ask each participant to ask one question and just one follow-up, if you have one. Operator, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. And the first question will come from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question and congrats on the strong results. Brian, one for you about the sustainability of this demand, specifically on the data center side. I think people are pretty aware that the macroeconomic drivers are all going the right way, and that's helping the enterprise side of things. But the acceleration of the cloud on the comm side for the last two quarters is beating your own expectations for growth rates and have been quite strong. How much of that do you believe is Intel-specific, and if you can go into the reasons why, or is the macro side really the bigger driver on those two vectors as well?
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
Sure, Ross. That's a good question. Let me try to answer it. So the first thing I'd tell you is that there is a bit here that the transition to cloud continues to occur. It's occurring at a bit even faster rate, so that you do see that trend going on. Remember, we've always talked about that over the long haul you have to look at these a bit. It can sometimes be lumpy. So our forecast for the long term is still in that high teens, low 20s range for that kind of growth.
We thought that enterprise is clearly up. We think that, as you said, a lot of that is reinvigoration of investments by companies in onsite data. Our view of the long term there, as I look out over the long term again, it's still that should be in a declining mode versus moving those workloads long term over to the cloud.
So, if I take a look at this, as Bob said in his prepared remarks, if I look at our data-centric businesses in general, so even just beyond the data center, we see these growing in that mid to high teens range. And that's how we view this, and we do believe that is sustainable. And it will move from cloud to enterprise. And sometimes you'll see IoT pick up a bit and offset something, but that's why we grouped those into that data-centric, but they're all really tied together. It's data coming from the edge, moving through the network into the data center, and really being based in the cloud and analytics being applied to it, and people using that data then to make decisions or drive businesses. So we think it's sustainable in the data-centric numbers that you saw, but it will float between those various segments.
Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
The only thing, Ross, that I would add is in terms of our outlook in the more near term, our outlook for the year is continued strength into the second quarter, similar to the first quarter. But beyond that, it's probably a little cloudier. I think we are benefiting from global macroeconomic environments. I think the higher earnings and the ability to deduct IT-related expenditures I think has given CIOs a little more money to spend. And we see ourselves benefiting from that through the first half of the year. Second half is going to be a little bit of a wait-and-see as to whether the short-term dynamics continue into the second half.
But if you go back to Brian's comments, I think what we do know is this increased demand for compute data, analytics, storage, rapid retrieval is what's really driving the demand for high-performance compute. And not only do we see the unit volume strength, but also the ASP strength, which we think is a function of Intel-related products.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
That's very helpful. For my follow-up question, for either of you, frankly, on the 10-nanometer pushout, do you believe that the competitive lead you have versus your competition is shrinking, or is this a challenge everybody is going to have? And then the gross margin side of that equation, Bob, you said it was going to be a headwind into the full-year guide. Any sort of linearity about when that starts to move from being a headwind to a tailwind would be great. Thanks.
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
Sure, Ross. So let me start with we absolutely have product and process leadership. We're shipping 10-nanometer products today. So I did want to make sure that that was very clear to you, and those are the densest, highest performing products out there.
We're slowing the ramp down as we go and fix these yields, and we're able to do that. A), we understand the yield issues. They're really tied to this being the last technology tied to not having EUV and the amount of multi-patterning and the effects of that on defects. But also, the real strength of 14-nanometer, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we've done 70% improvements in the performance of that technology over its current lifetime. And we believe it continues to have legs, that we can continue to make improvements, both within that process technology and architecturally. That's really giving us the breathing room to go and make these yield improvements.
So it's really balancing between delivering the world's best products. So we believe our roadmap for 2018 is as strong or stronger than it's ever been. And we have the ability to carry that into 2019, allowing us to get the yields where we want them to be. So the cost and the spending are really in line with what you as a shareholder expect from us.
We believe that if you take a look at others during this timeframe, if you looked at anybody else and said 70% improvement on a technology node, they may rename those nodes as we go through this. And we have always chosen to be really transparent and clean and just say it's improvements on the existing technology rather than renaming. So we believe we have that.
Now as we look out in time, we do see the density. If you just take that component, the density gap is narrowing a bit, but that's out in time. But again, performance is really a function of multiple parts of the process around power and performance and in architecture. And that's why we think our products continue to lead and be the world's standard.
Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
And on the gross margin question, the strong both volume and ASP performance in the first quarter contributed to gross margins being 2 points ahead of our expectations at the beginning of the year, so we saw that real good performance on the top line flowing through in the first quarter.
What we indicated for the full year, though, there's no change in our full-year gross margin. That essentially is a function of continued volume and ASP strength, but partially offset by yields that are improving but not quite at the rate that we had anticipated on 10-nanometer. And secondly, our costs associated with – we expected at the end of the year that we'll have pre-PRQ reserves that will be a little bit higher as we shift into 2019. So strong first quarter, strong for the full year, but those 10-nanometer costs will be a little bit of a drag.
When we step back, we still look at gross margins for the full year that are at the high end of our historical range, in the 60% to 65% range, which is good. And for us, that's despite the fact that we're getting really solid growth from our lower-margin but earnings-accretive businesses like modem and memory. Thanks, Ross.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thank you.

Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to follow up on that 10-nanometer point. So as the volume production pushes out into 2019, given you understand the yield issue supposedly, is this a first half pushout, or does it push out into the second half? And when it actually does ramp, do you think it actually will be the current 10-nanometer process that's shipping, or will that be slipping out to 10-nanometer plus potentially?
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
So I'm just going to correct you. You said that supposedly we have the solutions. We do understand these, and so we do have confidence that we can go and work these issues, Stacy. Right now, like I said, we are shipping. We're going to start that ramp as soon as we think the yields are in line. So I said 2019. We didn't say first or second half, but we'll do it as quickly as we can based on the yield.
The last part of your question about whether will it be a 10 or 10-plus-plus or 10-plus I think was your question, the yield improvements that we're making are just that, more focused on yield. So think of them as improvements to the various edge stuff, the lithography stuff, thin cleans (33:54) and things like that in order to really drive the multi-patterning and, in some cases, multi-multi-patterning, where you have four, five, six layers of patterning to produce a feature. It's really about that. They aren't necessarily around performance.
We do have plans on 10-nanometer already, similar to 14-nanometer, for 10-plus and 10-plus-plus. And so we think all of these technologies now have multiple years of performance improvements built into them as they come off the floor.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Thank you. For my follow-up, I wanted to ask about gross margin drivers and free cash flow drivers into 2019. We have CapEx pretty significantly outpacing depreciation at the moment. You'll have that 10-nanometer ramp starting. Memory and modems are probably going to be growing. And then on the free cash flow side, we've got the reversal potentially of the NAND prepayment eventually as you start shipping the NAND that you've been paid for. How do we think about the drivers, gross margin puts and takes around those elements and maybe others as we go through – get into 2019?
Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
First, I'll probably not dwell a whole lot on 2019 as we focus on trying to execute what we believe will be an outstanding 2018. But I think there are a few dynamics that we've been wrestling with. As you know, over the last couple years, we've seen a gap between earnings and cash flow, and it's really been driven by a couple things. One, success, and by that, I mean accelerating rates of growth and the additional capital that goes along with that growth, both CapEx and inventory levels. So those have been one of the drivers. Secondly, we've brought on 10-nanometer equipment but haven't necessarily put it to use yet, so that's a cash driver without an impact on earnings. And third, memory is in the investment phase. So those three things have really been what's driving the gap.
And we've done a few things in light of that that you're aware of. One, memory, we engaged in the strategic supply agreements that you mentioned, which really for us is a sign that our customers are excited and committed to the technologies that we're building such that we can help – we can use their money to help fund the scaling of the business. And we think that's a good positive short, medium, and long-term move.
And the other thing, just if you think about, Stacy, how we guided this year, you have earnings. If you don't give us credit for the ICAP gains last year and strip that out, you see earnings growth. That's roughly 25% – 26%. And you see free cash flow growth that's in the mid-30s. So you'll start to see that gap narrowing as we go through the course of this year.
And then the other thing is we're going to make a fairly significant cash tax payment in 2018 as a result of the ICAP gains from last year, and that's roughly $1.2 billion that's going to weigh on our cash flows this year. If you strip that out for a second, what you see during the course of 2018 is roughly 25% earnings growth and roughly 50% free cash flow growth. And that gap begins to narrow while we're accelerating the growth rate of the business.
So those are the dynamics in terms of how we're deploying capital for accelerating top line growth and the improvements on free cash flow relative to earnings per share this year. As we get through the course of 2018, we'll start to shed a little more light on what that means for 2019 later in the year.
Mark H. Henninger - Intel Corp.

Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Hey. Thanks, guys. I guess another question on the manufacturing. Can you just talk about why the ramp in 10-nanometer or why the yields have been a little bit slower than expected? Have there been any changes in manufacturing? And then also, should we expect this to extend to future generations as well; i.e., a little bit slower than it had been in the past?
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
Sure, so the issues around 10-nanometer, I'm trying to lay that flat out without getting too deep into the technology. But this is the last technology that doesn't incorporate EUV. And what you also need to understand is that we took very aggressive goals at 10 nanometers. So if you talk about the scaling factor or think about it as the multiple at which you shrink a feature, we took a target of 2.7. So you took any feature and run over 2.7 is the dimensional shrink that you did to this device. For example, on 14-nanometer, we took a target of 2.4, so you're almost 10% more aggressive on 10 nanometers.
And if you look at what is the industry standard, what the foundries and other players are typically doing, they're typically in that 1.5 to 2.0 range. So there, we're maybe 20% more aggressive. So it's very aggressive goals to hit our cost targets and where we want the technology to be. And that combined with the end of life of the immersion scanner before we hit EUV has just created something that's a little bit more difficult.
So that's why I have the confidence that this is not something we're shipping. The transistors work. We know the performance is in line. So it's really just about getting the defects and the costs in line to where we want.
As far as what does that imply for future technologies, we made a lot of changes at 7 nanometers. 7-nanometer currently is the first technology forecasted to implement EUV, so that immediately makes the lithography system different. We're going back to a more standard, for us, compaction number of 2.4, so that makes it a little bit easier. We think we bit off a little too much in this case. And it may not seem like a lot, but 10% can make a lot of difference in this kind of a world.
And thirdly, we are using some very unique packaging technologies and such that allow us. At 7 nanometers and beyond, we're really moving to a world where you're not going to look at any piece of silicon as being a single node. You're going to use what we're going to call heterogeneous techniques that allow us to use silicon for multiple nodes. So you may use cores from 7 nanometers and IP from 14 nanometers and even as far back as 22 nanometers for the parts that don't need the high performance. And we're able to put those together and make them perform and behave like a single piece of silicon in the package. So really 7 nanometers is quite a bit different, and so I think as a result, we don't expect to see these kinds of impacts on 7 nanometers.
Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Great. For my follow-up, I know in the presentation, you mentioned that adjacency ramps will be responsible for some of the gross margins being down in Q2. Does that have any impact on gross margin for the rest of the year, or are you assuming that data center growth is going to slow down in the second half of the year, and that's another reason why the gross margin hasn't moved up, or is it entirely the 10-nanometer issue?
Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
No, it's maybe all three. First, we do expect the adjacencies throughout the course of the year to continue to grow faster than the rest of the business, if you will, so that will have a compression effect throughout the course of the year. Secondly, yes, 10-nanometer will be a headwind. And third, for data center growth, while we're expecting strong growth through the first half of the year, the second half of the year implied in our guidance is a deceleration.
If you put it in the context of the updated guide, we have data-centric growth going from mid-teens to higher teens. And you can attribute virtually all of that to DCG because obviously it's the biggest component. But we do expect there to be deceleration for DCG growth from first half to second half for sure. We hope we're wrong, but where we sit right now, we see the trends continuing into Q2. But we'll have tougher comps. We'll have tougher competition going into the second half. And we're going to wait to July to see how we see the trends we've experienced through the first four months of the year play out for the second half.
Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Great, thanks guys.
Mark H. Henninger - Intel Corp.
Thanks, Chris.
Operator
Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Yes, thanks for letting me ask a question. Just the first question is on CapEx that's been coming up a bit. If you could, talk a little bit about the incremental growth in CapEx, what that's associated with. And are there any CapEx effects associated with the changes in the ramp of 10-nanometer?
Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
Just the CapEx that we took up, $0.5 billion is really a function of the incremental $2.5 billion of revenue. So, Chris, when we came into the year, we guided a larger CapEx of roughly $10.5 billion, and we had full-year revenue of $65 billion. So we've taken $65 billion up to $67.5 billion. That's going to require roughly $0.5 billion additional CapEx for the second half of the year and as we go into 2019. So it's the best I've ever felt about a CapEx increase. And it's a result of $2.5 billion more revenue. And net the CapEx increase, as we indicated, we'll generate an additional $1.5 billion of free cash flow as well.
Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
All right, great. Thank you. And as a follow-up, perhaps you can give a bit more color on the expectations on memory as you go through the year. I know you talked about that being profitable and I think consistent with what you guys said last quarter. Have there been any changes in your outlook for the year? And if you could, talk a little bit about what's framed your expectations as you look through the year for memory.
Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
First, no real changes. As Brian mentioned, it's our first $1 billion quarter in Q1. We feel good about the demand that we're seeing. Gigabyte demand is relatively strong. Our cost per gigabyte coming out of our Dalian fab continues to trend down. And at the same time, we see ASPs were down a bit.
But as we go through the rest of the year, we see demand and supply to be relatively well balanced. We are ramping Mod A (00:46:47) in Dalian, so that is in the early stages of the ramp. That's costing a little bit. But continued gigabyte demand, continuing to scale the Dalian fab, and continuing to come down – the cost per gigabyte curve are all contributing to what we believe will be a continued growth and profitability for the business for the full year.
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
And maybe the only thing I'd add to that is, Bob mentioned it in his remarks. Our 64-tier product we also believe gives us really a leading-edge product and also very good costs relative to the market. So as we ramp that technology in Dalian, at 64 tiers, we believe our costs are very competitive relative to the rest of the market.
Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Great, thank you.

Thank you. The next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Yes, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the questions. Congratulations on the strong results. Brian, I think within DCG, the cloud hyperscale dynamics are well understood by investors. 90 days ago, I think what surprised everybody, probably including yourselves, was just the strength of enterprise in the December quarter. And I think when you reported December, you were reluctant to call that a trend, and you wanted to get some more data points.
I'm curious as to what the view of enterprise is now 90 days later. And specifically, a couple of your key software partners last year in Microsoft and VMware finally brought out their hybrid cloud software stack solution. And I'm wondering if that's actually been the driver of some of this pent-up demand in the enterprise. And how sustainable do you think it is?
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
Yeah. It's a great question, John. What I would tell you is clearly, as we look out into Q2, we're expecting the same kind of positive trends on enterprise for the second quarter. I think as we look at the long term, though, that trend that says enterprise should decline in that low single digits and it drives and helps fuel the growth of cloud, and that's not all of the driver of the growth of cloud, those workloads are moving over to the cloud base continue.
I think you're right. Products like Microsoft Azure and others where you can be a hybrid, Azure on-prem versus Azure in cloud, are great examples how – I think that low single digits is sustainable over the long haul, but I just don't see that trend. Again, I try and look at these businesses not over the quarter, or even within the quarter, or even one to two quarters, but really thinking about how am I going to invest over the next two to five years. I've got to look at that and say that trend is probably likely to continue.
Now for us, we also need to understand that those other segments of data center, the cloud and networking and comm, as I look at the Data Center Group, are now well over 50% of the revenue of that segment. So we are less and less impacted, I'll say, by the enterprise.
If you go back, when I started as CEO, enterprise was 60% – 70% of the business, and so we swung wildly by that. It's the other way around now, where the cloud and networking and storage are now that 60% to 70%, growing to the right, and enterprise is less and less. So the other thing you need to realize, John, is we're more driven by what that cloud is doing anyway.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
That's helpful. And as my follow-up to Bob, just a multipart question on the guide for Q2 and the full year. First, was the ASC 606 impact embedded in the original March quarter guidance? Is that the only quarter where you'll have an ASC 606 impact?
Second, is Wind River now out of the Q2 and full-year guide, or is that still in it? And how big is that business?
And then third, when you look at Q2 specifically, it just looks like the operating income beat seems a lot larger than the EPS beat. Is there anything going on below the line other than the tax rates that you guided to that can explain that? Thank you.
Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
Yes, great question. First on ASC 606 and what we expect for the full year, we had a strong benefit in the first quarter, and roughly half of that unwinds during the course of the year. So it contributed to growth in Q1. It will unwind itself throughout the course of the year. So full-year impact will be likely – at this stage of the game, we've got somewhere around $200 million to $250 million, but it unwinds through the next several quarters.
I think your second question, John, was Wind River. Our assumptions are that we will complete the sale of that business at the end of the second quarter. So it's in our second quarter guide, but it's a component of the first half to second half deceleration.
The third question, I think it relates to in the first quarter, we had good volume, operating margin flow-through to EPS. In the second quarter, the flow-through is not as rich. And the fundamental reason is we have some below-the-line charges associated with, A), the 2039 convertible securities that we have outstanding that have an exchange feature associated with them. And as people – as we hit a certain stock price, our holders can exercise that exchange feature. The implications are there is a non-cash charge associated with that, which goes through our interest and other line, that's negative.
The good aspect of it is, all else equal, it reduces our outstanding – our diluted shares, and we avoid a coupon going forward. But that will have – as more people exercise that exchange feature, we'll see that non-cash charge below the line. So that's causing a little bit of a drag on the operating income growth flowing through to EPS in Q2.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Perfect. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.
Mark H. Henninger - Intel Corp.
Thanks, John. And, operator, I think we have time for two more questioners.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is now open.
Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC
Thank you. I actually had a two-part question on 10-nano. The issues seemed to be going on now for some time, and it's almost as if the design libraries or something are flawed. So I guess the first question is why not skip 10-nanometer and go directly to 7-nanometer? You guys have a lot of EUV experience and it's going to cut out a lot of the multi-pattern layers. So that's the first question.
And number two, the real question is that if you did that, would that be a net drag to gross margin looking out because you never really monetized 10-nanometer? Thanks.
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
Okay, so let me try and answer your question. No, there's nothing wrong with the design libraries or anything like that. The proof of that is that we're shipping product. So if there were basic functionality issues like that, you wouldn't be able to produce and ship the product. Again, as I said, this is all around how many layers are on multi-patterning and the end of life of the immersion for the critical layers.
The second part of your question was would it benefit to just skip to 7 nanometers, and would that have an effect on the capital or the gross margins? The simple answer is no. I don't think that's a good idea. The best answer is there's a lot of learning that will happen that we can carry forward into 7 nanometers just like we carried from 14-nanometer to 10-nanometer.
The other thing is that we still hold – roughly 80% of our capital equipment is fungible to the next node or backwards to the prior node. And so that's why as we've shifted 10-nanometer and 14-nanometer, we were able to do that without shifting our capital expenditures greatly from – we're able to just move the capacity back and forth. The same thing is going to happen between 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer. So you'll have some percentage, and it's always based on demand and how fast things are ramping and all of that. But the equipment will be fungible for the most part between 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer as well.
But no, the right thing to do is exactly what we're doing. This is a unique opportunity we have. There's a lot more performance than 14-nanometer. We can keep driving that. We'll fix the yield issues. If 10-nanometer can have a 10-nanometer, a 10-plus, a 10-plus-plus, you're going to see a lot of products and a lot of performance out of that technology.

Got it, Brian. Thank you.

Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura Instinet. Your line is now open.
Romit Jitendra Shah - Nomura Instinet
Thank you and congratulations. Brian, I wanted to ask you about China. Your filings indicate that mainland China was about 20-plus percent of revenue in 2017. And I have two questions. One, does that figure represent your exposure to the domestic vendors in China? And I guess just in light of the current environment between the U.S. and China, there are reports now of a potential ban beyond ZTE. How concerned are you as it relates to the impact to Intel?
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
That number is much broader, so that would be, if you think about it, so everything from shipments into companies like ZTE or Huawei that are more domestically oriented, although Huawei ships around the world now. It goes to Lenovo and companies like that, Spreadtrum, all of those companies now. If you look at Chinese companies, very few are holding within just China. They're almost all shipping products and selling across the world. So the number is really representative of all of the companies that are building within China.
Our view is that China is an important market, as you just described, 20-something-plus percent. It's one of our fastest growing segments as well. It's important to us, and we're counting on our leaders and the leaders of the world to go resolve these issues. We believe in fair trade. We believe that countries and companies need to be able to play in markets fairly and compete, and we're counting on this getting worked out. That's very important to us.
Romit Jitendra Shah - Nomura Instinet
Okay, great. Thanks for that. And then, Bob, I'm sure you'll shed more light on longer-term spending targets. But as we build our models for 2019, do you think it's reasonable to assume that you can drive additional operating leverage beyond 2018?
Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
You're right. I will shed more light on that later. No, but I think look, the trends that you've seen over the last couple years is how we framed things back at our Analyst Day early last year, I guess. And that is that we're going to see an expanded TAM, and with that expanded TAM, accelerating growth in areas that have lower gross margins, and that we expect over time that there will be a modest degradation in gross margins as a result of growing earnings in different segments. But at the same time, we've said that that gross margin modest erosion we believe will be offset by continued – both continuing to invest in the critical priorities, but getting leverage on our existing spending base.
So with that, I think you're going to have a natural offset. We're two years ahead of our targets to get to 30%. We're excited about the accelerating growth of the company. And we do believe that as we continue to accelerate growth and invest in key priorities that our leverage on spending continue to come down.
Romit Jitendra Shah - Nomura Instinet

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Intel Corporation Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Mark Henninger, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Mark Henninger
Thank you, operator, and welcome everyone to Intel's fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call. By now, you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO earnings presentation, which replaces the CFO commentary that we previously used. If you've not received both documents, they're available on our Investor website, intc.com. The CFO earnings presentation is also available via the webcast window for those joining us online.
I'm joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO; and Bob Swan, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them followed by the Q&A.
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.
A brief reminder that this quarter we have provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we will be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The CFO commentary and earnings release, available on intc.com, include the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations.
With that, let me hand it over to Brian.
Brian Krzanich
Thanks Mark. 2017 was a record year for Intel and fourth quarter results were outstanding. Well ahead of the forecast we outlined in October, based on the strength on both our PC-centric and data-centric businesses. I will review our results with you in just a moment, but before I do that I would like to share a few words about security. We've been around the clock with our customers and partners to address the security vulnerability know as Spectre and Meltdown. While we made progress, I'm acutely aware that we have more to do, we've committed to being transparent keeping our customers and owners appraised of our progress and through our actions, building trust.
Security is a top priority for Intel, foundational to our products and it's critical to the success of our data-centric strategy. Our near term focus is on delivering high quality mitigations to protect our customers infrastructure from these exploits. We're working to incorporate silicon-based changed to future products that will directly address the Spectre and Meltdown threats in hardware. And those products will begin appearing later this year.
However, these circumstances are highly dynamic and we updated our risk factors to reflect both the evolving nature of these specific threats and litigation as well as the security challenge more broadly. Security has always been a priority for us and these events reinforce our continuous mission to develop the world's most secured products. This will be an ongoing journey, but we're committed to the task and I'm confident we’re up to the challenge. To keep you informed, we've created a dedicated website and we're approaching this work with customer first urgency. I've assigned some of the very best minds at Intel to work through this and we're making progress.
With that, let's turn to our 2017 and fourth quarter results. We just wrapped up the best year in Intel's history with the best quarter in Intel history. Revenue was up 4% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, 8% if you exclude McAfee, setting an all time record. Our data center, IoT and FPGA businesses each set revenue record. We meet or exceeded all of the financial commitments we made to you at the beginning of the year and our focus on efficiency and profitable growth produce significant leverage, driving non GAAP operating income up 21%.
Our data-centric businesses deliver the technology foundations for the newer data economy, making the analysis, storage and transfer of data possible, giving our customers the ability to turn data into amazing experiences and actionable insights. They are central to our strategy. Data-centric revenue excluding McAfee was up an impressive 21% over the fourth quarter of last year, and I would like to share a few highlights with you starting with DCG.
DCG's revenue was up 20% over the fourth quarter. The cloud segment was up 35%, comp service providers were up 16%, enterprise was up 11%, and our adjacency revenue was up 35%. We saw broad base demand strength with customer preference for high performance products driving richer ASP mix. Cloud segment results were driven by significant volume growth and continued customer preference for higher performance products. In the comm service provider segment, we continue to take share and grow revenue as customers chose IA-based solutions to virtualize and transform their network.
Enterprise segment strength was driven mostly by ASP as customers transition to Xeon Scalable product in a seasonally strong fourth quarter, IT buy window. While we continue to see enterprise customers offload workloads to public clouds, we're also seeing those customers prioritize performance solutions for hybrid and on-premise build outs. Customers across all of our segments are accelerating deployment of the Xeon Scalable processors, which is ramping roughly in line with our historical Xeon transition.
We continue to demonstrate leadership and progress in artificial intelligence with the data center, for the edge and from 100s of watts to megawatts. Our software optimization for the Caffe framework has improved already strong Xeon Scalable ResNet-50 influenced performance by two times, just since the launch in July. The first generation Nervana Neural Network Processor ran on neural network less than two weeks after we received silicon and we've shipped our first customer unit.
At the edge, Google announced its AIY vision kit featuring our Movidius vision processing unit and Amazon announced the DeepLens, the world's first deep learning enabled video camera for developers, which uses an installed CPU, graphics and compute libraries for deep neural networks. We're also seeing design wins that combine technology from multiple data-centric business units, reinforcing the idea that we've developed a unique and differentiated collection of capabilities that can address customer challenges together more effectively than anyone business could alone.
A great example is Darvas' recent announcement of their deep sense product line, which combines core CPU, Intel FPGA-based network video recorders along with Movidius VPU-based cameras, enable people and automobile detection in smart city applications using artificial intelligence. In the Programmable Solutions Group, we saw strong double-digit growth in the data center, auto, embedded, and advanced product categories, as well as last time buys of legacy products. That strength was partially offset by softness in the comm's infrastructure.
In Q4, we launched the Intel FPGA SDK for OpenCL to dramatically increase productivity for our customers. We also delivered first-to-market leadership innovations in this Stratix 10 product line, including the first SoC FPGA with an armed processor at more than 1 million logic elements and the industry's first FPGA with integrated HBM2 memory. Our Internet of Things grew 21%, with continuing momentum in retail, video and in-vehicle infotainment vertical. Wind River saw strong multiyear contractor growth and delivered its most profitable quarter ever for Intel.
Memory business grew 9% and achieved profitability in Q4, a strong client volume was partially offset by a one quarter qualification delay of a data center SSD volume. Last quarter, I shared with you that our leadership technology is resulting in strong customer interest in long-term supply arrangement. That interest has continued to grow. We have since signed additional agreement and now expect prepayments totaling roughly $2 billion over the course of 2018. Mobileye had another strong quarter and business momentum is growing. Our steady design winds over the course of 2017 and 15 new program launches in 2018 are both increases a 2.5 times over the prior period.
We now have level two plus and level three design wins with 11 automakers to collectively represent more than 50% of global vehicle production. These advance program launch over the next two year and they represent a major lead in functionality versus current semi-autonomous distance, and our significant step towards saleable level four and level five fully autonomous distance. We reached an important milestone in the fourth quarter, the announcement of our level through five autonomous driving platform based on EyeQ5 and Atom, which will sample over the next few months.
We believe this will be the most advanced, scalable and efficient platform of its kind. EyeQ5 will deliver 23 tera ops of deep learning performance and a 10 watt power envelops or about 2.5 times, the efficiency of the competition. Just a couple of weeks ago at CES, we announced that by in 2018, we expect 2 million EyeQ-equipped cars will be collecting crowd-sourced data for the REM, our road experience management mapping solution. The resulting map will first be utilized in level three getting in 2019. The ability to crowd-sourced data to build and rapidly update the procession match required for higher levels of automation is a major differentiator in our plan to build out the safest and most affordable autonomous vehicle system. It's also a great example of our data-centric strategy at work.
And finally, I would like to touch on our PC-centric businesses, the client computing group. Over the course of the year, the PC market improved our 14-nanometer manufacturing cost came down and the competitive environment intensified. Against our backdrop, DCG is focused on innovation and performance especially in growth segment by gaming two in one thin and notebook and enterprise, led to record core mix and record i7 volume in the fourth quarter. We also shift our first low volume 10-nanometers skew and our modem business grew 26% over the fourth quarter of last year.
Intel is undergoing one of the most significant transformation incorporate history. While the PC-centric company to a data-centric company. We've made thoughtful disciplined investment along the way that expanded our TAM to $260 billion. Those same investments have produced the collection of data-centric businesses that are unmatched, growing at double-digit rate and approaching 50% of the Company's revenue. Our opportunity is larger than it's ever been and we're hungry to compete and win.
In 2018, our highest priorities will be executing to our strategy and meeting the commitments we make to our owners and our customers. This concludes our commitment to restoring customer confidence in the security of their data. This year Intel will celebrate a half century of innovation that has profoundly changed the world. Over the last 50 years, we invented the architecture and manufacturing technologies that have made personal computing, the Internet and the cloud not only possible but pervasive. The journey hasn't been without challenges, nothing worth doing ever is.
Our culture has been forged through taking challenges head on and developing solutions our customers can count on. That includes working directly to address the Spectre and Meltdown security threats. We leave 2017 on a financial high note, but I am even more excited about what's to come about our strategy producing great products for our customers and great returns for our owners.
I see Intel innovation changing the world for another 50 years and that journey starts with 2018. Over the coming year, we'll bring amazing innovation and performance for the PC market against the state-of-art in the artificial intelligence, lead the way towards mass 5G deployment, launch the industry's first new memory architecture in two decades and take another step towards a safer world in which autonomous driving is a reality. Looking back on 2017, I could not be more proud of our team and all they have accomplished. As I look to our 50th year, I am more optimistic and confident than I've ever been about Intel's future.
And with that, let me hand it over to Bob.
Bob Swan
Thanks, Brian. The fourth quarter was an outstanding close to a record 2017 and we're building real momentum heading into 2018. Revenue for the quarter was $17.1 billion up 8% year-over-year. Operating income was $5.9 billion up 21% year-over-year and EPS of a $1.08 was up 37% year-over-year. From the capital allocation perspective, we redeemed $1.6 billion of 2,035 convertible debt, reducing our share count by 59 million shares, and repurchased 500 million of higher coupon debt and exchanged $1.8 billion into 30 year debt at a 1% lower coupon rate. On tax reform, our Q4 GAAP earnings reflect a one-time tax impact of $5.4 billion, and our guidance reflects approximately 7 point improvement in our effective tax rate going forward.
To summarize, we had a fantastic quarter and year and are on track to exceed the three year targets we laid out at our Analyst Day, one full year ahead of schedule. Our Q4 results demonstrate a continued momentum in our transformation from a PC-centric to a data-centric company. Intel's data-centric businesses those outside of the PC segment are at an all-time high mix of 47% of our revenue, up from approximately 40% in 2012. We've made significant investments to expand our TAM and do new data rich markets like memory, programmable solutions and autonomous driving. These investments are just starting to pay off and will fuel Intel's growth going forward.
Our PC-centric business was down 2% in a declining PC market and it continuous to be a great source of profitability. DCG delivered its most profitable year since 2011 by focusing on premium and growth segments with industry leading products. This business generated the cash to fund Intel's investment in new data-centric growth. Moving to Q4 earnings, we generated significant EPS expansion in the quarter up 37% year-over-year. Our EPS improvement was driven by strong top line growth a five point improvement in operating margin and significant gains from our ICAP portfolio.
Our gross margins expanded two points in the quarter and outstanding is a percent of revenue declined by 3 points as we delivered 700 million more revenue and 300 million less spending. In terms of operating efficiency, we're well ahead of schedule of meeting our commitment by reducing spending to 30% by 2020. We now expect to achieve this goal no later than 2019. Total spending was down 6% year-over-year in the fourth quarter while we continue to investing in our key priorities including driving more to off forward, wining artificial intelligent and autonomous driving. R&D spending is a percent of revenue was down approximately 1 point and our SG&A cost was down over 2 points as we rationalize our marketing and sales programs and generate significant leverage in our SG&A functions.
Let met touch briefly on our segment performance. The Client Computing Group had another strong quarter. Revenue of $9 billion was down 2 points and operating margins were down 2 points. Operating margins were lower on 10-nanometer transition cost. We saw strength in the commercial gaming business and we believe the worldwide PC supply chain is operating at healthy level.
The Data Center Group had record revenue of $5.6 billion, up 20% year over year, and operating income of $3 billion grew 59%. Q4 operating margin was 54%. As Brian mentioned earlier, we had strong growth in execution across all segments. Overall, unit volume was up 10%, ASPs were up 8%, and our adjacencies grew 35%. Our ASP strength demonstrates the value customers see in our high performance products.
Xeon Scalable launched in July is ramping well with customer broadly deploying its leadership products family. Revenue scale from leadership products, ASP strength and the exclusion of 2016 one-time charges drove strong operating income growth for the business. For the full year, revenue was up 11% and operating margin came in at 44% both ahead of the expectations we provided at the beginning of the year.
The IoT, NSG, and PSG business segments are becoming a larger component of our overall business, collectively growing 19% year over year. Our Internet of Things business achieved record revenue of $879 million, growing 21% year over year, driven by strength in industrial and video and continued momentum in our retail business. Operating profit was $260 million, up 42% year over year. The Mobileye business also had a record quarter and we're on track to our deal thesis.
As we called out last quarter results for the Mobileye acquisition are included in our all other segment and reflects the Q4 integration of Intel autonomous driving group spending in the Mobileye. Our memory business had revenue of $889 million, up 9% year-over-year with strong demand for data center FFT solution and demand signals outpacing supply. This segment was profitable for the quarter and we expect this segment to be profitable for the full year of 2018. Programmable Solutions Group had record revenue of 568 million with 35% growth driven by strength in data center, automotive and embedded.
Operating profit was a $156 million, up 95% year-over-year. The Stratix 10 design win pipeline, which represents FPGAs largest ever doubled over the last year due to engagements in 5G, cloud computing and the infrastructure transition to network function for virtualization. We laid out our capital allocation priorities early in the year. Invest organically, expand acquisitively and return capital to our shareholders and do it wisely. In the year, we deliver on our promise.
First, we generated strong free cash flow at 10.3 billion in the year and returned 8.7 billion to shareholders through dividends of 5.1 billion and share repurchase of 3.6 billion. Second, we funded a majority of the Mobileye acquisition from the sale of non-core assets during the year including McAfee and the sale of ASML shares. And third, we redeemed 1.6 billion in convertible debt reducing 59 million shares, and we also tendered higher coupon debt for lower coupon debt.
Let me expand on the ICAP and treasury related transactions we executed in the quarter. First, we sold 11.4 million shares of our ASML Holding, which generated $2 billion in cash proceeds and again a $1.5 billion. Second, we redeemed our 2035 convertible debenture. This redemption created a 2.8 billion cash outflow in a non-cash loss of 385 million, which was tax decidable. Since this debenture was convertible and therefore dilutive, the redemption effectively acted as a buyback that will reduce diluted share count by 59 million shares. And third, we successfully tender 2.3 billion of high coupon debt in the quarter. We exchange 1.9 billion of all debt in the $2 billion of 30-year new debt, reducing our coupon rate by 1%.
We also redeemed 425 million of all debt for cash. This transaction both lowered our leverage and our interest expense. Adding in all up, 2017 was another record year for Intel revenue of 62.8 billion was up 9% year-over-year, driven by 16% growth in our data-centric business and 3% growth in PC-centric business. Operating income of 19.6 billion was up 18% on strong execution across the businesses and discipline spending. Earnings per share of $3.46 was up 26% on excellent operational performance and the benefit of $0.35 from ICAP net gain. With the change to the accounting rules for recognizing price changes on equity investments, we do not expect to see these ICAP gains repeat.
Before I turn to guidance let me provide a little more context on the impact of tax reform on our business. Intel's fourth quarter results reflect a higher GAAP income tax expense of 5.4 billion, as a result of U.S. corporate tax reform enacted in December. This includes a one-time required tax adjustment on previously untaxed foreign earnings able over eight years which was partially offset by the re-measurement of deferred income taxes to the new U.S. statutory tax rate.
Looking ahead, we expect the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will help level the playing field for U.S. manufacturers like Intel that compete in today's global economy. We expect the 2018 tax rate of approximately 14% driven by lower U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% lower tax on foreign income benefits of U.S. exporters and the continuation of the R&D credit. The change in our tax rate drives approximately $0.28 in 2018 EPS. Intel has a rich history of investing the U.S. led research and development and U.S. manufacturing. This last year we committed to the setup of our fab 42 facility creating thousands of jobs at completion. These tax forms provide further incentive to continue investments like this.
Before we turn to our 2018 outlook, I also want to highlight two accounting rule changes. First, new accounting rules for revenue recognition; and second, accounting for equity gains and losses. We do not expect a material impact to revenue from the revenue recognition accounting change. The changes in accounting for equity gains and losses will require the recognition of unrealized price changes each quarter. The equity holdings like our ASML position will see mark-to-market adjustments that will flow through earnings in 2018, which may create greater volatility on a GAAP basis. This change resulted in an impact of 2.7 billion of net unrealized gain at year end that we booked to equity on January 1, 2018.
Now moving to the full-year, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $65 billion up 4% year-over-year. We expect operating margin of approximately 30% with gross margins down 2 to 2.5 points and spending as a percent of revenue to be down 1 to 1.5 points. The decline in gross margin is driven by growth in our adjacent businesses as we play in an expanded TAM and transition costs associated with 10-nanometer, both partially offset by higher gross margins from our 14-nanometer products. We expect EPS of $3.55 up 14% excluding the ICAP net gains driven by a strong top line growth and a lower tax rate of approximately 14%, which will increase EPS by approximately $0.28.
We expect to net capital deployed at $12 billion. This reflects gross CapEx of 14 billion offset by approximately $2 billion of customer prepayments for memory supply agreement. Increasing CapEx reflects our and our customers confidence in our memory technology leadership. We expect free cash flow of $13 billion, an increase of approximately 30% directly contributing to our decision to raise our dividend by a full 10%.
As we look to the first quarter of 2018, we're forecasting the midpoint of revenue range at $15 billion up 5% year-over-year. We expect operating margin of approximately 27%, flat year-over-year with a 3 point decline in gross margin offset a 3 point decline in spending. We expect EPS of $0.70 up 11% excluding ICAP net gain from strong top line growth and a lower effective tax rate.
We believe 2018 will be another record year for Intel and we feel great about where we are entering year two of our three year transformation. We've met and exceeded our commitments. Our PC-centric team continues to operate very well in a down market, and our data-centric businesses are up double-digits collectively as we continue to transform the Company to power the cloud and smart connected devices.
With that, let me turn it back to Mark.
Mark Henninger
Alright, thank you Brian and Bob. Moving on now to the Q&A as is our normal practice, we would ask each participant to ask one question and just one follow-up, if you have one. Operator, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Our first question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
John Pitzer
My first question just revolves around the revenue guidance for the March quarter at the midpoint down about 12% sequentially is a lot worse than I guess normal season, and I guess I am trying to figure out kind of the parameters that you guys are using to come up with that number. Was there something in the DCG strength in the calendar first quarter that you don't think is repeatable given your comments around the PC supply chain being healthy, that to me feels a little bit more seasonal than not in the March quarter? So I am just kind of curious as to why the Q1 revenue would be so much below, what is being kind of the five year medium seasonality for Q1?
Bob Swan
John, thanks, it's Bob. So really two things going on, one, the enterprise growth in DCG as Brian highlighted, it was up 11% in the fourth quarter. So extremely strong seasonal growth for enterprise, a little bit -- more than we expected frankly, that's number one. Number two, PSG 35% growth was helped by end of life sales during the course of the quarter. And if you adjust for maybe a more normalized enterprise growth and PSG growth, you get to more of a seasonal Q4, Q1 dynamic, so in line with seasonal if you make those two adjustments.
John Pitzer
And then Brian on my second question revolves around CapEx, I think it was a year ago on this conference call that you kind of mentioned that you thought that calendar year '17 and calendar year '18 would be sort of above churn line CapEx spending for you guys and then you thought it would come down again in calendar year '19 to a more normal trend albeit you didn't quantify the trend. Just given the big uptick in '18 the 14 billion, I realized two of that’s already being covered by prepayments. But how do we think about kind of the trend line CapEx from here especially in light of the changing relationship between yourself and Micron on INFT?
Brian Krzanich
So you know my prospective is, if you take a look at right memory kind of logic on our CapEx scaled with our increase in revenue and kind of our overall growth rate. So that’s felt in line. With memory, we're going to take a look at it, really on a year by year basis, and I would tell you that Bob's is really doing a good job of helping their business unit, look over the capital. And when we have demand enough and people are willing to pay upfront to that demand and reserve the capacity like we done this year, we’re going to go head and put that capacity in place plus what we think what Mark and we can do as distributing across overall market.
And that’s really independent of that changing relationship with Micron, that’s really more about how we're doing development work in time, really that’s actually there are two generations away that been really effect 2018. This was really about what we saw for the overall main memory market plus the additional capital and capacity that people wanted to reserve through that process. We will look at that each year John and say, okay as we look out into '19 at the end of '18 will be that same analysis.
John Pitzer
Thank you for that evaluation, Brian.
Bob Swan
I would just -- sorry, just follow on to Brian's comment. In the way we're looking at memory and we talked a bit about this on the last call is increased confidence in our customers and the technologies that we’re developing where those relationship, they will help fund the scaling of the capacity to grow the business and we're really trying to match net capital employee to be in conjunction with known customer demand. So what that means -- what that meant for 2017 as the net capital was roughly $1.5 billion. We held that relatively flat in 2018, so our growth capital is higher.
We have more conviction in the customer base to fund $2 billion of the growth capital. So memory, we’re really trying to focus on customer adoption of our technology to effectively and efficiently scale the business. And then just the only other point that make logic and remember year ago in terms of our outlook for growth we're well ahead of our outlook for growth. We’re probably have the time, implied in our outlook was probably 62.2 billion kind of number in 2018. Obviously, with our guide now 65 billion were 2.5 billion higher and if that incremental growth that's placing similar demand for our logic, logic capacity both for 14, 10-nanometer and as we take forward about 7-nanometer.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Joe Moore
I wonder if you could talk about OpEx obviously you've been pretty discipline there bringing that down, but you've also got some other initiatives you announced to discrete graphics effort, maybe if you talk about -- it seems like we costs a lot, if I just look at what your competitors are spending? And then, at some point you’re going to spend money on NAND that used to be shared with Micron. So just, can you talk about the puts and takes are? And is there something we should think about this coming down to sort of offset those potential increases?
Brian Krzanich
Sure. I’ll start and I’ll let Bob to kind of give you there under the cover detail of dollars. But Joe, this really, we’ve already factor all of those things in so things like the discrete graphics is a ramping spend. The memory R&D spending out in time, so for ’18 has no really effect. And then we’ve given an overall efficiency and all of our R&D spending to offset that. So increasing in GPU spending, there are some other increases as well around things like autonomous driving and some of the other artificial intelligence in some of the emerging areas.
You’re right, overtime will increase spending in NAND in R&D, but those are being offset by efficiencies that were driving into the rest of our product R&D. And we really feel like we’re getting good play where we can keep the place of innovation going on our core products, while we fund these new initiatives as well and not to compete from our continued efficiency efforts across spending as a percent of revenue.
Bob Swan
Joe, I'll just add some numbers to Brian's word. We’ve kind of come down from 36% to 35% to 34% to a second half of 2017 at roughly 31% of revenue. So we’ve been coming down as we’ve been doing two things. One, the investment that we’ve been making our paying off in terms of higher growth; and number two, we're making real trade-offs in where we’re investing our money. As we go into implied in our guidance as we go into ’18, we’re expecting our spending level to be roughly flat with an annualized 2017 spending level.
So, we’re going to -- and underneath that, continuing to drive efficiencies and sales and marketing, as we become more of a B2B or data-centric company and getting real leverage on our G&A functions across the board. So, we’ve made real progress during the course for the last couple of years. Including the second half, we expect to make continued progress while making the critical investments and things like discrete graphic, autonomous driving, artificial intelligence and continuing to invest in Moore's Law.
Joe Moore
AND as you think about that NAND investment, I guess people have asked me, what your -- what the separation from Micron on the long-term path means? Is that you know sort of more of a focus on proprietary products like 3D XPoint? Or do you from fully committed to sort of more competitive NAND to your more competitive market?
Brian Krzanich
So, sort to make sure you -- we clarify a little bit, Joe. The separation of development work is -- again out in time think of it in 2020 timeframe is when real independences come and its NAND specific. So, we continue to work together on to the plus point. So and this is really just, it’s not a separation of the Company or something about the relationship. The relationship with Micron continues to be a good one. And I foresee it will continue to be good one in the future as well. This is about direction of where we are going to take our products and we have talked about our aggregate data center-centric and really tie a performance and allaying to the customer market that we are really looking at. And so, the spending in R&D we are talking about right now is really a NAND specific, 3D XPoint continues to be a joint effort.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Ambrish Srivastava
I wanted to go back to DCG specifically on the up margin front. We have not seen the high handle if my model is correct, it's been eight plus quarters. So, can you please speak to the sustainability of the up margin? And kind of what were the drivers that got you to that level? And then I have a follow-up for these things.
Bob Swan
Yes, so we came into the year and we indicated that we expected margins for the full-year to be in the 40% to 45%, and obviously, we started out low but we said our expectations were that we grow throughout to the course of year. A couple of things in the fourth quarter, obviously, you know growth. So we'll build leverage on our existing investment was a big contributor.
Secondly, ASPs were up 8% so of the 20% growth ASPs accounted for 8 point to that. And as Brian highlighted, whether its cloud comps or enterprise, customers in the quarter will really paying for performance and that performance for us was higher ASPs.
Third, continued progress on unit costs. And then last you may remember last year's fourth quarter, we had some warrantee and IP-related charges in that data center business that I think cost was roughly 4 points year ago. So last year's, we're little deflated. But good volume leverage, strong ASPs as customers paid for performance and unit cost improving.
Ambrish Srivastava
So we should expect this level going forward Bob?
Bob Swan
Yes, I think I wouldn't get too far away from the 40 to 45 to be honest with you. I think as we go into 2018, we think good cloud momentum that’s been consistent performance over the course of the year or last couple of years. Comms, our performance we believe it was real strong in a somewhat sluggish market so real share gains. But the high kind of seasonal enterprise growth and strong ASPs in the quarter, we think are more seasonal in nature and we are not anticipating enterprise growth to stay at these levels as we go into '18.
Ambrish Srivastava
And then from my follow-up on the gross margin for next year, you provided the sort of qualitatively the adjacencies as well as the cost impact from the 10 RAM. But A, I was surprised you didn't mention competition because now AMD will have a full year of a product in an area they never were for -- I shouldn’t say never, they were not in an area for a long time. So, question is, are you seeing any competition? Are you factoring that in? And then B, would it be possible to quantify the two impacts that you've mentioned?
Bob Swan
Yes, it's just -- I'd highlight three things that are driving the deterioration that I'd start first with -- we've always characterized our long-term gross margins to be in the 55% to 65% range, and for the last several years and including in our guidance this year will be at the upper end of that 60% to 65% range. But for the last couple of years that we've had maturity of 14-nanometer and that maturity both in terms of getting more and more performance and lower and lower unit costs, has been contributors to gross margin.
As we go into '18, we see 14-nanometer modest contributions from profitability because we've matured on the cost curve, that's an increasingly competitive environment, and we don't anticipate dramatic ASP improvements over the entire company, some cases yes, but for the most part, no. So, we'll see some continued improvement in 14-nanometer products during the course of the year.
Secondly we're really accelerating the growth of our adjacent businesses, the investments that we've been making in both the data-centric businesses and our growth in modem. Those are contributing to our year-on-year EPS growth; however, those both of those product lines of businesses have lower margin. So our success in modem and memory is having a mixed impact on our gross margins.
The third area is we're going from 10-nanometer startup where costs are coming down to more the ramp to the 10-nanometer and that ramp is going to weigh on the margins, as we begin to develop production going into the second half of the year where we're way up the curve where our yields and costs are. So, those are kind of the three things as we see it. If I were to characterize roughly plus one, roughly minus two, roughly minus one, rounding those.
Brian Krzanich
I understand your question about specifically around competition. I think every year we look at it as the competitive environment, and we're out to compete for our customers. And so we factor that in each year appropriately I think against the competition. So we look at the competitive environment and we believe Xeon Scalable, great performance that has, our overall product roadmap, we think we have a highly competitive roadmap and have adjusted for that in our forecast.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein. Your line is now open.
Stacy Rasgon
Firstly, can you walk us through your free cash flow waterfall? I can't get your flattish operating income on 4% revenue growth. It was a couple of billion dollar ICAP gains, CapEx I guess maybe flattish with some memory payments. Taxes maybe get to me a third to half of the way there, but where does the rest of the free cash flow comes from? Are you just draining the kind of working capital or what? Can you walk us through?
Bob Swan
Yes, first $13 billion free cash flow, up roughly 30% year-over-year, first higher cash earnings. Our guide has EPS of up roughly 14% in that guide there is depreciation has grown in '18 relative to 2017. So that has just higher cash earnings. Secondly, we do expect lower working capital as we go through 2018. And third, we have higher strategic customer supply agreement and those three things were all contributed positive. And then obviously, Stacy, the higher growth capital is a bit of an offset; so longer cash earning, better working capital, more strategic supply partially offset by higher CapEx.
Stacy Rasgon
Okay, so my follow-up, I want to ask about that gross next year of your kind of adjacent businesses versus your core businesses. Of that 65 billion of that 4%, can you give us a feeling how much of that is coming from adjacent, I guess mostly memory in modems versus the core must be the decent given the gross margin pressures? And I guess as a corollary to that you mentioned a one delay -- one quarter delay in data center memories, was statement in XPoint?
Brian Krzanich
No, that was a NAND out start with just answer to that question, Stacy. That was 3D NAND SSD we -- has been delayed in the fourth quarter and those are being addressed now. So, that was that comment.
Stacy Rasgon
And growth on -- sorry, go ahead.
Bob Swan
I think on your first question. In the 65 billion, we characterize it as roughly low single digit decline in our PC-centric businesses. So implied to that is, PC may be decline a little bit more and modem adjacency within the CCG segment partially offsetting that. In the overall guide, we said that the data-centric businesses would be growing in the mid teens, obviously that we believe that would be a strongest segment within the makeup of our data-centric business will be in memory. There would be the function of customer calls that Brian just highlighted, and we expect NSG growth to accelerate throughout the course of 2018. Those single digits decline on PC-centric and mid team growth on data-centric businesses.
Stacy Rasgon
So, what is the memory strength implies for the data and the growth of the DCG growth, unprecedentedly given the strong performance in Q4?
Bob Swan
For the most part, the wins for NSG that will go through date center will be late in 2018 and won't really have an impact on the overall growth rate of that business. So it's primarily about growth of 3D NAND during the course of the year.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is open.
C.J. Muse
I guess couple of housekeeping questions, if I could kind of put them together. Curious, if you could share with us, how are you thinking about CapEx spend between logic and memory? And then on the 10-nanometer start-up, can you share with us when you’re expecting to begin depreciating those costs?
Bob Swan
First, on the CapEx, we indicated the gross capital in the year of 14 billion that we’ve got customer strategic supply agreements of roughly 2 billion. So our net capital is $12 billion in the year. Again, I’ve kind of break that into two pieces; memory, net capital employee no change and logic CapEx up roughly a $1 billion year-on-year. And as we mentioned earlier that $1 billion is a function of primary growth continuing to grow 14-nanometer. Second, scaling up 10-nanometer. And third, investing in next node 7-nanometer during the course of the year. So, those three things are really driving the $1 billion increase in CapEx for logic.
The second part of your question -- so for 10-nanometer, as we bring that equipment online, we turn on. There is some equipment now that being depreciated, but as we bill bring online as we ramp in the second half of the year when we turn that equipment on is when we start depreciating. So we’d expect our depreciation bill in second half for the year to be growing. And that’s one of the contributors to -- really to come full circle. That’s one of the contributors to the gross margin deterioration during the course of the year, as we start to ramp 10-nanometer.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Vivek Arya
For first one, Brian, I’m curious. Are you baking in any effect on sales of cost of pricing for many resolution on the processor security issues? There is one line of thinking that says, customers might decelerate their purchase, and then you have others industry saying that customers might accelerate that purchase later on. So I’m just curious how you’re looking at the financial implications positive or negative from this issue near-term and longer term?
Brian Krzanich
Sure, so we try and kind of break it into two kind of answers for that Vivek. From a cost standpoint, we’ve baked in and we've talked about that we don’t expect any material impact of this security exploit on our spending or product cost or any of that. So that’s how we baked that in. From a fourth half standpoint, we actually made our forecast and we've checked it as we go through this the first two weeks here of the year against our prior forecast to make sure that the forecasting incorporated any changes or any signs we're seeing up or down.
And I would tell you at the highest level, we are not seeing much of the change in those forecasts as a result of that the flow. I'd tell you it's pretty balanced right now, so spending not materials and didn’t make any add there and then our forecast we had a forecast we checked in as we go through the first few weeks of the year and it hasn’t really changed that all as we looked at it.
The only other think I'd add for Brian's comment earlier, we kind of go into the year realizing that it's an increasingly competitive environment and our focus is on right now continuing to bring the best highest performance products to market, but also to lots of time and energy spend on focusing on fixing those issue, primarily through software patches as opposed to short-term hardware things.
Vivek Arya
And as my follow-up. For the full-year, how should we think about a growth in just the DCG business? I understand you gave some color around the entire data centric group which includes memory than other segments, but just sort of apples-to-apples how should we think about growth in just DCG that had a very strong double-digit growth here in '17?
Brian Krzanich
Throughout the course of the year, we -- sorry, throughout the course of '17, we kind of guided high single-digits; and we kind of executed to that throughout. And then Q4 wasn’t dramatically different than the first three quarters of the year really with the exception of the high seasonal spend for enterprise. And that really took us from a high-single digit to low double-digit or 11% growth for the year. As we go into '18, we do not expect that. We think that in the enterprise space, things will go back down to the negative single-digits range and therefore don’t anticipate a dramatic difference in the how we laid out DCG a year-ago. So that's how we are thinking about it.
If I maybe elevate that back up a little bit and just think about when we are putting together our plans for the year, there is two areas where our tendency is to be a little cautious on the outlook. One is PC TAM, we tend to be a little more cautious on PC TAM, and we tend to be a little more cautious as we think about enterprise growth in the DCT business. And the reason we do that as we think it's important to be cautious get our cost in line, and if our assumptions on market rates to growth turn out to be conservative, we will benefit from -- we believe we benefit from higher volume and real strong flow through to net income. That's how we plan the year covenant to 2017 and we did kind of the same thing for 2018.
So I don’t anticipate dramatically different DCG growth and how we led out 2017 as we enter 2018 because we really haven't assume a change in trajectory of enterprise CIO spending in the course of the year.
Operator
Thank you. Yes, our last question comes from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Your line is now open.
Blayne Curtis
Just wanted to go back to the DCG ASPs. You were talking about the ramp of scalable being kind of to plan, but then I think you got a nice tailwind and I think you implied enterprise at a higher percent of scalable. So just wanted to give us talk on broad strokes just where the scalable ramp is here? And how your expectations kind of getting through the year where that could go?
Brian Krzanich
So I'll start and Bob can add some number detail in all. The Xeon Scalable ramp is right in line with prior ramps of similar products on our DCG roadmap. And what you saw when you talked about Q4 was not necessarily more Xeon Scalable, but people buying up the stock on Xeon Scalable which drove the ASP. So, they're buying a higher performance, higher priced part, and that's not uncommon when the early stages of the ramp. People come in and they typically want to buy the highest performance parts at the beginning. And then they fill out their distribution as other buyers come in and other parts in the market kind of opened up. So, ramps on schedule and aligned with high ramps and the ASP was more about SKU, they're buying up on higher performance parts than necessarily a volume statement.
Blayne Curtis
And then I also want to go back on just -- I just want to also go back on gross margin as well as you look for March that you mentioned, the drop is from adjacent businesses as well 10-nanometer. Obviously, memory you're signaling a big ramp and it doesn't move out fully. I just wonder, Bob, if you just walk through the 10-nanometer startup costs as they kind of move through the year and kind of picking our line between those two in Q1, what's the bigger factor?
Brian Krzanich
So, actually the mix dynamics are going to be a bigger factor overall for the year both in Q1 and for the rest of the year as our memory and modem business continue to accelerate strong growth. So that's going to be the biggest impact. I think 10-nanometer will have an impact just right off the gate and will kind of continue throughout the year, as we scale volume, but also need to improve yields during the course of the year. So hopefully that's helpful.

Thanks, Mark.
The third quarter exceeded our expectations with revenue $16.1 billion, which is $400 million better than our outlook. Operating income of $5.6 billion was more than $700 million better than our outlook.
Our data-centric businesses grew 15% year over year, reaching 45% of our revenue, proving that Intel is becoming a data-centric company. The fiscal discipline that Bob and I have talked about is delivering results even faster than we had forecasted while simultaneously allowing us to focus more on innovation in our key growth segments.
Revenue grew 2% or 6% after adjusting for the McAfee transaction. Operating income grew 8% and earnings per share grew 26%, both reaching all-time records. Add it all together, and this was a remarkable quarter in what is shaping up to be a remarkable year.
Our strategy is to be the driving force of the data revolution across technologies and industries. Our data-centric businesses are the company's growth engine. Individually, these businesses provide great value to our customers. Collectively, they're solving our customers' problems in a way that no individual business or product could. We've built a collection of capabilities that is unmatched. At the same time, our PC business remains central to our success. It's a source of great profit, cash flow, scale, and intellectual property.
We've made great progress in both our data-centric and PC-centric businesses over the last few months, and I'll share a few important milestones that illustrate that progress.
We're going to start with CCG [Client Computing Group], which produced exceptional results despite a declining PC TAM. PC market conditions continued to improve, and we achieved record Core i5 plus Core i7 client mix. Our focus on an annual beat rate of innovation and thoughtful segmentation combined with an investment strategy designed to produce results, even in a declining market, is paying off.
We're especially excited about the launch of our latest 8th Generation Core processor, code named Coffee Lake. The Coffee Lake family includes our first six-core desktop CPU. And it's our best gaming processor to date, with up to 50% better performance than the competition on top game titles. We're on track to ship our first low-volume 10-nanometer part by the end of the year. That will be followed by the initial ramp in the first half of 2018, with both high volume and system availability in the second half of 2018. We shipped our first modem into the auto industry, and our modem revenue was up 37% in total over last year.
Moving on to our data-centric businesses, DCG [Data Center Group] revenue grew 7% in Q3 and remains on track for high single-digit growth for the year. We saw strong cloud growth, outgrew the comm service provider end market and, while the enterprise decline moderated sequentially, we still see workloads moving to the cloud.
Cloud and comm service provider revenue combined is nearly 60% of DCG revenue now. In less than three months, we've had more than 200 Xeon scalable OEM systems begin production shipments, and our customers across all of our segments are beginning deployments that will continue to ramp in Q4 and through 2018.
In our Internet of Things business, revenue was up 23%, with strength across the retail, industrial, and video segments. We also continue to build momentum in the vehicle infotainment market, winning designs from our competitors at leading automakers.
Early in the quarter, we closed the Mobileye transaction a full four months ahead of schedule. So far this year, Mobileye has won 14 ADAS [Advanced Driver Assistance Systems] designs across 14 automakers, a pace well ahead of the 12 wins they recorded all of last year. These designs provide for typical features like automated emergency braking, lane keeping, and adaptive cruise control. But several also include next-step functionality like highway autonomous driving. We're also winning marquee designs for Level 3 and higher levels of autonomy, including our strategic partnership with BMW and Fiat Chrysler.
Most recently, we announced that Waymo's newest vehicles, the self-driving Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans, feature Intel-based technologies for sensor processing, general compute, and connectivity. With 3 million miles of real-world driving, Waymo cars with Intel technology inside have already processed more self-driving car miles than any other autonomous fleet on the U.S. roads.
Intel and Mobileye provide the auto industry with unmatched product breadth, the architectural flexibility to support open and closed implementations, and technology leadership. Our progress in just a few short months illustrates the benefits of our combination. And together, we can deliver the promise of autonomous driving in a safer, collision-free future.
Let's move on now to memory and FPGAs. Our memory business grew 37% over last year and operating margin improved significantly, as Fab 68, our Dalian factory, continued to beat both its ramp rate and yield goal. Fab 68 accounted for more than half of our supply in a quarter where more than 70% of the total bits were 3D NAND.
Our memory innovation and technology leadership is having an impact. We shipped the industry's first 64-layer data center SSDs and have a strong Optane design win pipeline. That leadership technology has also resulted in strong customer interest in long-term supply agreements, and we've already signed two such agreements. Bob will share more about our approach, but this is an important step that will mitigate the short-term cash flow impact of ramping our memory capacity.
And finally, in our FPGA business, revenue was up 10% over last year, with growth in the data center, embedded, and automotive segments, where we're ramping designs like the Level 3 autonomous 2018 Audi A8 and DENSO's stereo vision system. Strength in these segments was partially offset by continued weakness in comms infrastructure. Our design win revenue value was up more than 10% in the third quarter, the highest level in more than three years.
This business is central to our success in artificial intelligence. In Q3, Microsoft announced that it would use our 14-nanometer Stratix 10 FPGAs for its accelerated deep learning platform that's code named Project Brainwave. And as part of a broadening engagement between our companies, Alibaba is using Intel FPGAs to power the acceleration of the service of Alibaba Cloud.
We've made tremendous progress in AI and advanced computing technologies over the last few months. In addition to our FPGAs and autonomous driving wins, we launched the Movidius Myriad X, the world's first vision processing unit with a dedicated neural compute engine to deliver artificial intelligence capabilities to the edge in a low-power, high-performance package.
We also achieved new research milestones, as Intel scientists pursue exciting emerging forms of compute. We delivered a 17-qubit superconducting test chip for quantum computing to our research partner, QuTech. And we'll follow that up with a 49-qubit test chip by the end of the year. We also unveiled the Loihi, a self-learning test chip that mimics the brain's basic mechanics and makes machine learning faster and more efficient.
Later this quarter, we'll ship the Nervana neural network processor, the industry's first commercially available processor of its kind. I also announced last week that Facebook is working in close collaboration with us, sharing their technical insights as we bring this new generation of AI hardware to market.
Together, these accomplishments reinforce several things for me. First, Intel is the leader in AI inference from the core of the data center to autonomous vehicles out to the edge devices where low power is especially critical. Second, artificial intelligence takes many forms and will require computing solutions that are tailored for the workload, the environment, and the user, rather than a one-size-fits-all. And third, our investments and pipeline of innovation position us to lead for years to come.
We had a quarter any CEO would be proud of. And I'd like to take a moment to remember our former CEO and my friend, Paul Otellini. Paul had an enormous impact on the industry and this company, and his Intel family will miss him. He would be proud of our growing momentum, and it's an important part of his legacy.
Wrapping things up, I'm excited about both our progress and our prospects. And we're competing aggressively for our $260 billion TAM, the largest opportunity in our history, with lots of room to grow market segment share. In some of our segments, we're facing new or resurgent competitors. In other segments, we are the new competitor. But in all cases, competition brings out the very best in our company, as our third quarter results demonstrate.
We're now well ahead of our commitments we made to you in January. Our transformation is accelerating. And we're raising our full-year expectations for revenue by $700 million and for operating profit by $900 million, our third consecutive increase this year. This puts us solidly on track to deliver the best year in the company's history for the second year in a row.
And with that great news, I'd like to hand it over to Bob.
Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp.
Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon.
This was an excellent quarter for Intel. Versus the expectations we set out at the beginning of the quarter, our revenue is better, our gross margins were stronger, and our spending was lower. As Brian said, we're on track for another record in 2017.
Revenue in the quarter was $16.1 billion, up 6% year over year excluding McAfee, and we achieved record earnings. Operating income was $5.6 billion, up 8% year over year, and EPS was $1.01, up 26% year over year.
From a capital allocation perspective, we closed the Mobileye transaction and funded a significant portion of the purchase price through the sale of non-core assets, including reducing our position in ASML and proceeds from the partial exit of McAfee.
Additionally, we signed long-term NAND supply agreements, providing more than $2 billion in prepayments through 2018, significantly improving free cash flow for our memory business. We generated $6.3 billion in cash flow from operations, and we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders.
At our Analyst Day in February, we talked about our strategy to transform from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company. Our Q3 results demonstrated continued momentum in our transformation. Intel's data-centric businesses, those outside of the PC segment, grew 15% year over year and now represent 45% of our revenue, up from approximately 30% in 2012. This collection of businesses is well positioned to capitalize on industry trends, create great value for our customers, and represents the company's growth engine going forward.
Our PC-centric businesses generated flat revenue in the quarter and improved operating margin by over 3 points. The CCG team continues to execute extremely well in a declining PC TAM environment. Our focus on performance-leading products and a smart segmentation strategy is working. This business provides scale, funds IP, and generates a significant portion of the company's profits and cash flows.
Moving to earnings, we generated significant EPS expansion in the quarter, up 26% year on year. Our EPS improvement was driven by solid platform execution, strong growth from our adjacent products and businesses, and lower spending, resulting in $408 million growth in operating income. Additionally, we continued to monetize some of our ICAP [Intel Channel Alliance Program] portfolio positions, resulting in a gain of $0.13 per share.
We made a commitment at the beginning of the year to reduce spending to 30% of revenue by 2020 at the latest while continuing to invest in key growth areas and capabilities. We are making great progress. Total spending was down 6% year over year in the third quarter, with continued investments in our key priorities, including driving Moore's Law forward, artificial intelligence, and autonomous driving.
At the same time, we're executing with operational discipline and generating significant leverage from higher revenue growth. Our R&D spending as a percent of revenue was flat and our SG&A costs were down 3 points as we rationalize our marketing and sales programs and generate significant leverage in our G&A functions.
In addition, we've made changes to our co-marketing programs to provide more flexibility and efficiency to our customers. These changes resulted in a reduction in revenue of approximately $200 million during the quarter, reducing year-over-year growth in CCG by approximately 2 points and DCG by just over 0.5 point, with a corresponding reduction in spending. These changes collectively have no impact on operating income. The impact of these changes will continue into Q4 at a slightly increased level.
On a full-year basis, we expect direct spending to be approximately 33%, one point better than our prior guidance and down over two full points from last year.
Let me touch briefly on our segment performance on slide 5. The Client Computing Group had another outstanding quarter. Revenue of $8.9 billion was flat year over year, and operating margins grew by 3 points. Flat revenue was driven by client ASPs up 7%, unit volume down 7%, and our adjacency business up 15%, partially offset by the changes to our co-marketing programs. We saw typical Q3 inventory build ahead of the holiday season, and we believe the worldwide PC supply chain is operating at healthy levels.
This segment had another quarter of significant profit growth, with operating income growing 8% from strong Core mix, continued improvement in 14-nanometer unit costs, and lower spending.
The Data Center Group had revenue of $4.9 billion, up 7% year over year, and operating income of $2.3 billion grew 7%. Q3 operating margin was 46%. As Brian mentioned earlier, we had strong growth in both the comms and cloud service provider segments, which are nearly 60% of our DCG revenue. Overall unit volume was up 4%, ASPs were up 2%, and adjacencies grew 16%. We launched Purley in Q3, and in less than three months we've had more than 200 OEM systems begin production shipments.
Revenue scale from leadership products and spending leverage and efficiency drove strong operating income growth for the business. We expect DCG to meet our full-year expectations of high single-digit growth and operating margin percent in the low 40%.
The IoT, NSG, and PSG business segments are becoming a larger component of our overall business, growing 25% year over year. Our Internet of Things business achieved record revenue of $849 million, up 23% year over year, driven by strength in industrial and video and continued momentum in our retail business. Operating profit was $146 million, down 24% year over year, from continued investments in the automotive segment.
We closed the Mobileye transaction in early August, four months sooner than we expected. The Mobileye team executed extremely well in the third quarter and exceeded our expectations, with $82 million in revenue and $39 million in operating income. Going forward, results for the Mobileye acquisition will be included in our All Other segment. Increases in spending in this segment will correspond with reductions in the IoTG segment as we realize cost synergies from this acquisition.
Our memory business had record revenue of $891 million, up 37% year over year, with strong demand from data center SSD solutions and demand signals outpacing supply. This segment had an operating loss of $52 million, an improvement of $82 million versus last year.
Our memory fab in Dalian continues to make great progress. Yields continue to improve, and unit costs are well ahead of expectations. The core NAND business continues to be profitable, and we expect the memory business as a whole to be profitable in 2018, both ahead of our prior estimates.
The Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $469 million, up 10% year over year, driven by strength in advanced products, data center, automotive, and military. Operating profit was $113 million, up 45% year over year. We're making good progress in realizing cost synergies with the integration of this business.
Moving to slide 8, our cash position of $17.5 billion at September 30 is basically unchanged from the beginning of the year, but we've had lots of moving pieces during the year. First, we have generated $7.2 billion in free cash flow year-to-date, and we've returned $7.4 billion to shareholders through the form of dividends of $3.8 billion and share repurchases of $3.6 billion, including $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion respectively in the quarter.
Second, as we mentioned earlier, we closed Mobileye in the third quarter for $14.5 billion in cash and funded over 50% of the purchase price from the sale of non-core assets during the year, including McAfee and the sale of ASML shares. Earlier in the year, we received $924 million from the sale of 51% stake in McAfee. And in the quarter, McAfee repaid the promissory notes of $2.2 billion and issued a dividend of $735 million.
Third, we expect to generate $1.5 billion to $2 billion more free cash flow versus where we were at the beginning of the year. The additional free cash flow was driven by higher earnings, lower CapEx, customer prepayments on supply agreements, partially offset by increases to working capital associated with stronger growth and NSG and modem momentum.
Based on these factors, we're raising our full-year revenue guidance by $700 million to $62 billion, operating income guidance by $900 million to $18.8 billion, and EPS guidance by $0.25 to $3.25 per share. The improvement in revenue outlook is primarily driven by higher expectations of the PC business and continued momentum in memory. The improvement in operating margin is primarily driven by our increased revenue outlook and lower spending. The increase in EPS is driven by higher expectations of revenue coupled with gains on the sale of our equity investments.
And on slide 11, as we look to the fourth quarter of 2017, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $16.3 billion, up 3% year over year excluding McAfee. We expect operating income of $5.2 billion with gross margins flat year over year and spending, as a percentage of revenue, to be down approximately 2 points. We expect EPS of $0.86, driven by operating margin expansion and higher revenue.
2017 is shaping up to be a record year for Intel. We feel great about where we are nine months into our three-year transformation. Since January, we have raised our revenue outlook by $2.5 billion, our operating income by $1.7 billion, and our EPS by $0.45.
At the same time, we are investing to compete and win in an expanded market. Our PC-centric team continues to operate very well in a down market and our data-centric businesses are up double digits collectively, as we continue to transform the company to power the cloud and smart connected devices.
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.
Mark H. Henninger - Intel Corp.
Okay. Thank you, Brian and Bob. Moving on now to the Q&A, as is our normal practice, we would ask each participant to ask one question and just one follow-up, if you have one. Operator, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Our first question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hey, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. BK, a longer-term one for you, you rattled off a number of AI advancements that Intel is having, whether it be on the Nervana side or the Stratix side. Can you talk a little bit about the competitive environment in there? You mentioned that it's not going to be one size fits all. But you could give a little bit of how Intel does have an advantage versus some of the early movers in that space. And then perhaps, more importantly, when will we externally as investors be able to start to see the financial benefits of these new products?
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
Hi, Ross. So let's talk about this. We can kind of break this down. So, first, we are already seeing the benefits of AI in that. Remember, as I said, we lead in inference, which is the actual application of artificial intelligence, and we're continuing to really grow in that space.
I think AI, if you take a look at it in general, machine learning, it's the smallest segment to a workload if you look at the data center, but the fastest growing. So you're going to see it continue to become a bigger and bigger portion of our business. You're seeing the effects in our numbers already around Xeon, Xeon Scalable, the FPGAs; we talked about the Microsoft Brainwave launch that's occurring. So those products you're going to see, I'll call those more of our traditional products. And also at the lower end, outside the data center, things like Movidius and now Mobileye, you're seeing those hit our P&Ls as well real-time now as we speak.
The other products like Nervana, you'll start to see really more towards the back end probably of 2018 from a P&L perspective. If you take a look at Nervana, it actually – we get our first silicon out. It will be handed out as test silicon. We have a yearly cadence of products, and so I expect the first substantiations to be more people figuring out how to use it. It won't be a big impact. But as we go through next year and move on beyond that and get the second generation and beyond, that will grow, we believe, quite considerably.
And then products like Loihi, which is our neuromorphic, are same things. The part we've put out so far is really a chip for people to begin to use and learn how to program with neuromorphic, which is a very different type of machine learning. It lets you learn at hundreds of times faster rates than traditional, I'll say, GPUs and CPUs, especially around visual learning. Those as well you'll start to see late next year and beyond as people really begin to learn how to program with these. So seeing it already and those newer products really think late 2018 and beyond before they really start to hit P&Ls.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great, thanks for that detail. And then the follow-up question I had was actually for Bob, and it's on the OpEx side, and congrats on the great operating leverage in the quarter. As we think about the ways you can get that operating leverage, in the past Intel seems to have focused mainly on keeping the OpEx relatively flat and then revenue growth driving that leverage. But in the quarter and in the guide that you just delivered, it looks like OpEx is down about 6% year over year. Conceptually, as we go into the next couple years, how do you think investors should think about the balance of delivering that cadence up to the 30% mark that you're looking for over the next couple years? Is it more revenue growth, or are you indeed going to be cutting the absolute level of OpEx?
Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp.
Ross, great question. First, as you mentioned, we had great progress in the third quarter. We started the year at a spending level which was a little over 35% of revenue, and we came into 2017 saying that we would get that down to roughly 34%.
Reflected in our guidance is it will be closer to 33%, so we're delivering well ahead of our expectations, which have been a function of the two things you highlighted: one, much stronger growth; and two, lower spending levels. And those lower spending levels from the first half of this year to the second half are a function of continuing to look at every dollar that we spend, whether it's R&D, whether it's sales and marketing, or whether it's G&A, and making sure that those dollars are allocated towards the biggest growth opportunities, and we are not to redeploy that capital or to get it out of the ecosystem. So our first half to second half spend levels will be down roughly $700 million on a business that will be roughly $2.5 billion bigger in the second half versus the first half.
So we're making great progress on making real trade-offs on our spending levels and getting the benefit of stronger growth, and we expect the combination of those two to continue as we go forward.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great, thank you.
Operator
Our next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. Your line is now open.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I wanted to ask a little bit about the revenue drivers. Revenue upside for the year and I guess marching up for three quarters, but it continues to look to be the same trend, almost entirely from PC and memory. In the meantime, this is, in your own words, your biggest server refresh in a decade, and yet we're not seeing any upside. We're doing 7% year over year pretty much for the full year, which I guess I would classify as barely high single digit. We're not really seeing meaningful ASP increases from mix as Purley ramps. I was wondering if you could just give us a view on I guess your expectations for data center, where it's coming in, why we're not seeing more upside from the Purley ramp versus what we've seen from prior platform introductions, and whether or not 7% actually would qualify as high single digits by your definition.
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
I'll start and Bob can jump in, Stacy. First, because you've got a couple questions in there, what I would tell you is that the Purley ramp has just really started. It starts with the big cloud service providers. You saw Google talk about it a couple weeks ago. You saw Microsoft talk about it earlier this week. Those ramps are just beginning. I talked about the 200 design wins or design-ins at customers. Those are just starting to come out, so we're really early. These ramps, remember because we have to – it will go through the cloud service providers and the Tier 2 cloud service providers, then on into comms and eventually into enterprise as well. This is going to take a year or more. So I think it's early to make this judgment. The ramp is right within the range we predicted it to be from a ramp of that product
The second part of your question, is 7% high single digits, I'll just make it simple and say look, if you look mathematically, I think it would meet a minima of high single digits, but it's certainly not necessarily where we're targeting to get to, but it's a high single digit number. I'm not going to – the math doesn't lie.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Thank you.
Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp.
I'll just maybe add a little bit, I think, on the first part of your question. Overall, growth for the year relative to the expectations back in January, revenue will be up $2.5 billion. Obviously, PC is a significant part of that. Memory is growing faster. IoT is growing faster. PSG and data center, PSG faster in the second half versus the first half and DCG in line with our full-year outlook at the beginning of the year to be high single digits. So real good strength on clients, on memory, on IoT, and in line with the other businesses.
The other thing I'd just offer to follow up on Brian's commentary on DCG growth, maybe two things. One, we started out at 6% in Q1. We were at 9% in Q2. We're at 7% in Q3 off a real tough comp last year of double-digit growth in the third quarter. So I would say from a top line perspective, we're right in line with the guide that we gave at the beginning of the year.
And secondly and as importantly, our operating margins have continued to grow significantly quarter on quarter through the course of the year, with 46% operating margins in the third quarter. And we told you early on, despite a relatively slow start, the fact that operating margins for DCG to be above 40% for the year, and we're well on track to hit that important metric as well. So nine months through the year, great start to the year for us and DCG in line with our expectations and building momentum as we exit the year.
Mark H. Henninger - Intel Corp.
Did you have a follow-up, Stacy?
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
I do, thank you. I wanted to ask about gross margins really quick. So revenue was up 6% I guess year over year excluding McAfee. Gross margins are down like 90 bps year over year. I was hoping you could give us some color on the drivers of that shift. And in particular, how should we think about the trajectory exiting the year into 2018, puts and takes on gross margins as we go into next year, given what we've seen this year?
Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp.
On your first part, we laid out for the year 63% gross margins. And we're pretty much in line with that throughout the first nine months, and our outlook for Q4 is another 63%, so in line with the full-year outlook, which is in the high end of our historical guide range. So we feel pretty good about where we are.
For the dynamics underneath the covers, the trends have been fairly consistent: volume leverage with good scale going through the fabs; ASPs modestly better, much better in the first half on easier comps, slightly better in the second half on tougher comps. Unit cost continues to come down. The ramp costs associated with 10-nanometer are lower.
And offsetting those, you really have three things going on. One, we have a high growth in our adjacent businesses of memory and modem that weigh on – that are a big contributor to improved earnings, but they weigh on our gross margin. Secondly, we have higher engineering samples as we go into the fourth quarter. And third, the co-marketing change that I mentioned in the prepared remarks, Stacy, that has no impact on operating income but a modest impact on gross margin but offset by lower spending levels.
So you take those all into account and they've delivered solid Q3 dynamics, solid Q4 outlook. And the one change between Q3 and Q4 is primarily attributable to the mix of the higher-growth adjacency businesses. Those trends and those dynamics, we'll talk much more about 2018 in January, but those trends have been fairly consistent for the last four quarters.
Mark H. Henninger - Intel Corp.
Thanks for the question, Stacy.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Got it. Thank you, guys.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hey, thanks for taking my question. Bob, I just wanted to go back to some of the comments you made. In DCG, op margin was up a ton. It's actually above your full-year, so just curious where those cuts came from. And then as you look forward, I know you're not going to forecast for next year, but is there any reason why the spending would go up and down from here?
Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp.
The first half gross margins – I should say operating margins were lower, second half much stronger. Fundamentally, it's less about cuts, to be honest with you. It's more about continuing to grow the top line. continuing to get ASP improvements or compensated for the performance that we're delivering, and modestly lower unit costs. So the combination of those three are getting really good leverage and allow us to expand operating margins while we continue to invest in obviously Xeon but also in artificial intelligence. So that's what's driven the first half to second half dynamics. As I indicated, we started out the year saying that we were highly confident we'd be above 40% for the year, and that's how it's played out during the course of the year.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Great. And then I wanted to go back to the question on AI and inference, Brian. I was wondering if you could just comment on – today I think you said it was small. I was just curious. Out of the cloud spend, how much is inference today? And when you look at future workloads driving server units, where could that be in a couple years?
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
Sure, we don't separate out inference. So what we said is simply in the past publicly that AI is one of the smallest workloads and in fact one of the fastest growing. We haven't broken out – beyond just saying here's what cloud is growing at and here's what comms and here's what enterprise, we don't break out by workload. And there's a variety of reasons for that. Part of it, it's sometimes hard. The mixture of what – when somebody goes out and builds a rack, what is it going into? How much of its workload is really being used by AI? Anybody who tells you exactly what that number is, is just wrong, to be honest with you.
So it's very hard for us to say with precision that X percent of our units went into AI workloads because it's rare that a rack is purely AI except for rare cases. But we know that it's small, just by the type of interactions we have, but also fast-growing and one of the biggest areas of interest.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.

Thank you. Our next question is from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Congratulations on the strong results. Bob, maybe I can just ask Blayne's DCG op margin question a little bit differently. In the calendar third quarter, you actually I think had revenue up about $500 million sequentially in that business roughly, and operating profits grew by about $600 million sequentially. Can you just help us understand what drove that dynamic? Were there any one-times? And just given how strong the operating margin is, I know you've reaffirmed for the full year. But is the Q3 level the new norm we should start basing operating profit off of, or was there something specific in Q3 that drove the op margin leverage above 100% sequentially?
Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp.
No one-timers. In one sense, John, it's no real surprises for us. We anticipated growing throughout the year. We anticipated higher ASPs, i.e., sequential ASPs being a little bit stronger, and that would drive incremental operating income. And some of the benefits of just a lower overall G&A spending for the company is benefiting all the different P&Ls. The G&A is actually lower. So that's what's really been driving the improvement sequentially.
As you can tell from our full-year guide, there will be more of the same in Q4 relative to Q3. And then in terms of implications going forward, we got a great business. We've redefined the role we play in the data center business to be not a high 90% share player, but a 30% share player with lots of room to grow. And we expect that to be a continued important source of growth, both top and bottom line for the company. The specifics around that we'll talk more about it in January.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
That's helpful. Maybe for my follow-up for Brian, Brian, I know this is not a big part of your growth strategy going forward. But as you mentioned in your prepared comments, CCG is still very important to scale advantages, to profitability, to free cash flow, to your ability to invest in growth markets. And that's been a business that's been sort of remarkably stable over the last four or five quarters. It's grown over the last couple of years, in part because we've had relatively easy compares in the PC market. So I'm kind of curious, as you think about this business over the next call it four to eight quarters, how are you guys thinking about the corporate upgrade cycle or refresh cycle on PCs, the consumer refresh cycle, the gaming market, and I guess importantly, the modem business which is becoming a bigger and bigger part of this business over time? Do think you can still keep this business sort of on a flat growth trajectory, or how are you thinking about it?
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
Sure. So you've captured it quite well. Let's just talk about this. We can talk about it from a unit standpoint and then we can talk about it from how has our business done. From a unit standpoint, the decline has certainly slowed down. If you go back a year or two ago, we were high single digits to low teens declines at times year over year from a unit basis, and that slowed into the low single digits that we're seeing today, but we still are seeing a decline on a unit level.
And I always remind people, we've taken probably something like 25% of the annual units out of this business, yet grown in that timeframe the profitability of that business significantly. So, that I think just talks about both the great execution in products and segmentation strategy and just the leadership that that team, at first with Navin Shenoy and now with Greg Bryant, have really delivered to the company.
So our view is, John, that if you take a long-term view, we see the pattern kind of stabilizing at about where it is. I think we'll come in here and there will be quarters when the units are up slightly, and there will be other quarters when the units are down a little more slightly. But when we look at it over the long haul, they're probably going to be down those low single digits.
But we also see segments that are growing, that are very performance focused, which allow us opportunity. So you talked about them, gaming, 2-in-1 devices, thin and light, the Ultrabook as we like to think about it from the old, those products are continuing to see growth actually, and they are pushing that record Core i5, Core i7. They're pushing the desire for Core i9, which is a new product we introduced. Those are what's driving the segmentation, the ASP uplift, and the increased profitability. We think to some level that trend will continue. How long? I'm not going to be that good a prognosticator, but certainly for the near-term future, we don't see this trend shifting very much.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
And then, Brian, just on the modem side, your prepared comments, I think you said it was up 37% year over year. What's the sustainability of that business and your ability to continue to grow that business through penetration?
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
Yeah. I'm excited about the modem business. We, I think, really gotten a team together that is world-class. We believe we now are on a yearly cadence of world-class modems, which is really critical. That's a big hurdle to get that technology to where you can reliably put out on a yearly cadence a world-class modem. We believe we're there now. We continue to increase the profitability or the efficiency of that organization, which we've always talked about in the past, and that's continued. So we think we can continue to both drive the technology and continue to grow that business.

Our next question is from Romit Shah with Nomura. Your line is now open.
Romit Jitendra Shah - Nomura Instinet
Yes, thank you; great EPS growth. Bob, I think some of us who are more on the optimistic side definitely see a path to $4.00 of EPS, which makes Intel look compelling. I think some of the pushback though has been among value investors who look at free cash flow. And this year, for example, even with the equity gains, it looks like free cash flow is tracking down. So I know that this is an investment year, but how should people be thinking about free cash flow growth relative to EPS growth next year and maybe even 2019 as well?
Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp.
First, in 2017, people ought to be thinking about free cash flow growth being $1.5 billion to $2 billion higher than what was primarily reflected in our guidance, because we're saying that our current forecast will be much better than kind of where we started the year. And that improvement is really a function of three things; one, earnings growth, more operating earnings growth as opposed to the ICAP gains, but real solid operating earnings growth. Secondly, we reduced our CapEx outlook for the year from $12 billion to $11.5 billion this year. And third, the long-term agreements that we signed in the year.
One of the benefits in what we're trying to do is really match our net capital deployed in memory in conjunction with demand from strategic clients and partners, which has the effect of reducing the impact of the memory capital intensity on the free cash flow to the business that makes sense for our customers and makes sense for us. So we'll continue to look for those opportunities.
The biggest gap between our earnings performance and our free cash flow performance has been the higher capital associated with growth, number one, but in particular, memory. And we're really looking for opportunities to reduce our net capital deployed into memory, which will in turn grow free cash flow over time just closer and closer to our EPS growth.
Romit Jitendra Shah - Nomura Instinet
And I guess along those lines, Brian, can you just give us an update on how you're thinking about CapEx at these levels and going forward?
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
Sure. I think in our statements and in the release, we showed you that we actually lowered CapEx by about $500 million for this year. We've talked about CapEx and thinking about it as being in this range. I don't think we have anything else to say about – it's pretty close right now. We're just focused on the execution into Q4 and prepping for our view for 2018. So I don't want to have any other discussion on CapEx until we get to the January timeframe right now for 2018.
Romit Jitendra Shah - Nomura Instinet
Fair enough, thank you.

Our next question is from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thank you for taking my question and congrats on the great execution. The ASP trend in DCG was up 2% year over year, but it can be skewed by mix. So if we look at the four sub-segments, cloud, comm, service provider, enterprise adjacencies, if we just look at those buckets as a silo as you ramp Skylake, did ASPs move higher in all of those sub-segments? I'm just trying to get a sense for how broad-based the value capture was.
Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp.
I would just, without giving you all the specifics of ASPs by segment, I would just say the biggest driver of ASP improvement is really incremental performance. So as we continue to transition – yes, we're still transitioning Haswell to Broadwell, which all else equal there are positive ASP implications as we transition to Xeon Scalable and deliver higher performance. That growing mix of higher-performance products is the single biggest contributor to ASP. We're still in the early days, as Brian mentioned, in Xeon Scalable, but that is a high-performance product. And we would expect that will share in the benefits of high performance for our clients with higher ASPs. But that's the biggest dynamic.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great, thanks for the insights there. And the team has talked about accelerating the server roadmaps to be more closely aligned with the cadence of manufacturing technology migrations, I believe starting with the 10-nanometer node. Can you guys just give us an update there?
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
Yes, think of it – so first, absolutely you're right that we are going to move much more of our focus towards data center products coming first. It's not going to be the early part of 10-nanometer, though. You've got to look at the design cycles. And you make a decision like that, even if you make it last year, you'll start to see the effect at the back end of 10-nanometers and you'll really see it affect 7-nanometers, so not these early products on 10-nanometer, though. They were already in the hopper when we made that move.
Mark H. Henninger - Intel Corp.
Thanks, Harlan. And, operator, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator
And our last question comes from Matt Ramsay with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open.
Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Bob, I wanted to ask a little bit about G&A leverage. You talked about in the script and in some of the Q&A here some changes to the co-marketing programs and the like going forward in both the PC and in the data center business. Is there any way you could maybe bound for us the size of those and their contributions to what the run rate has been of overall OpEx, and what kind of opportunities there are potentially to further restructure those going forward? Thank you.
Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp.
Yes, just on the co-marketing program in particular, really what we're trying to do is retain the value of the Intel Inside brand, but also to be more flexible and align our spending in conjunction with our customers, more tailored programs by customer to drive more efficient demand. That's the intent of what we're trying to accomplish, and we're pretty excited about the change.
The quantification of that strategy in essence in the third quarter was roughly $200 million that in essence shifted from spending to contra-revenue, so no impact on operating income dollars but roughly $200 million lower revenue, $200 million lower spending. And we expect that to be modestly higher as we go into the fourth quarter. So again, more effective and efficient way to spend our marketing dollars in conjunction with tailoring programs with the OEMs, that drives the change in the geography of how those dollars are reflected in our P&L but doesn't really impact our operating income.
Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Thank you, that's really helpful. And then as a follow-up, Brian, in the automotive space, I think you mentioned 14 ADAS wins for Mobileye versus 12 all of last year, and that's in the ADAS space. And you have some of your competitors making quite bold announcements about wins towards autonomous driving programs long term. Maybe you could talk about how commitments are being made in ADAS versus autonomous and then how the acquisition that you've seen so far of Mobileye has maybe pulled some of your computing assets into these conversations for longer-term autonomous. Thank you.
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
Sure, that's a great question. So we mentioned that even out of those 14, many of those continue on up into Level 3, Level 4. The Level 5 work that you see out there is pretty far out there. And I'd tell you that's there's a lot of just experimental work going on there.
If I take a look at the bigger picture, which is what you're asking, this whole picture that we've been putting together is – I said in the statement that individually these businesses are great. But when you put all these together into one package and you're able to walk into a customer with a complete solution, they're truly world-class and something nobody else can deliver.
So you're right, when we go in and we talk to somebody about autonomous driving in general, whether it's Level 2 bots, Level 3, Level 4, or Level 5, we bring with us a suite of products, depending on what kind of architecture. And what we're seeing is different OEMs, different customers thinking about those architectures even differently across that spectrum. Some are thinking but by Level 5, I think my skills will be up. I want a closed system. I want to have much more control of the software. So we have a set of solutions we bring to them there. Some of them want to have more FPGAs for how they bring their software down onto the silicon earlier on.
But what we're able to do is bring our modems. We shipped, and we mentioned it in the release, our first automotive modem. So we're able to bring automotive modems all the way through 5G. Most of these car companies are having to build data centers, and not just data centers, centralized data centers, but really a data center architecture that goes all the way out with data and compute at the edge. You're going to want to be able to manipulate and transfer mapping, high-precision mapping, to the cars and data back from the cars to change those maps' construction and things like that. So we're building that architecture, and we have the products and the talent to uniquely work with them all through that infrastructure.
And then you get out to the car again and we can bring the FPGAs, the Mobileye for sensor fusion or compute. We can put Xeons in there. And each one of these discussions, they're all a bit different. They all have multiple phases as you go through 3, 4, and 5 on the levels. And what we're able to do is say you don't have to just take this one solution. This is not the only solution there is. What would you like to do? What best solves your problem in the most cost-effective, lowest power, efficient way? How much work do you want us to do in software and development versus how much work do you want to own and have IP within your company? And that's changing, as we said, over time.
And that's part of also why we're building out that 100-car fleet. Amnon [Shashua] really has driven a vision that says it's one thing to bring foils to a meeting. It's another thing to bring a car and say now let's go out and drive and show you how all of these fit together. So all of that is – this package that we have is unique and it's resonating quite well as we walk in to the various car OEMs. And I'm out there with them in various modes almost every week, every other week. Amnon is out. We're all talking about a complete package.

With that, let me hand it over to Brian.
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
Thanks, Mark.
Q2 was an outstanding quarter in which we set a number of records. We beat the expectations we set in April, primarily as a result of stronger desktop and notebook microprocessor volume, and set a second quarter revenue record. We're executing well to our priorities, and after adjusting for the McAfee transaction, revenue grew 14% year over year while non-GAAP operating margin grew 30%. Our data-centric businesses were up 16% year over year.
Technology and performance leadership are fueling our results. And in Q2, we extended our leadership with new breakthrough products in client computing, the data center and memory. With industry-leading products and strong first half results, we're on a clear path for another record year.
As we shared in February and reinforced in April, our strategy is to make Intel the driving force of the data revolution across technologies and industries. I outlined our top four priorities for the year in support of that strategy: growing the data center and adjacencies, ensuring a strong and healthy PC business, growing IoT and devices and executing flawlessly in memory and FPGAs.
I'd like to take a few minutes to highlight our progress in Q2. First, DCG. The Data Center business grew 9% in Q2 and remains on track to high single digit growth for the year. Strong public cloud growth continued, with revenue up 35%. Enterprise was down 11%, as workloads continued to migrate to the cloud and memory and solid-state drive constraints impacted server deployments. Comm service provider revenue was up 17%, while adjacencies, which serve all customer segments, rose 12%.
Cloud and comm service provider together are the growth engine in the data center, and together now make up nearly 60% of DCG's revenue. In 5G we're demonstrating end to end leadership in client and infrastructure. We have five ongoing trials with leading global service providers and 15 more in the pipeline. And we're on track with our development of IA, FPGA and ASIC silicon platforms based on new radio standards.
Earlier this month, we launched Xeon Scalable, formerly known as Skylake and with it, the industry's biggest platform advancement in a decade. Using Xeon Scalable, our customers have already achieved over 50 third-party verified performance world records and are seeing more than 1.6x performance increase over our prior generation product across a wide range of real world workloads.
For example, the new AVX-512 instructions double floating point performance, benefiting use cases like HPC, VR and AI. In fact, artificial intelligence inference throughput improves by 2.4x gen to gen. And when this silicon innovation is combined with our AI software frameworks optimizations, customers like Amazon Web Services are seeing inference performance improvements of more than 100x. The enthusiasm for Xeon Scalable resulted in our largest early ship program ever. We delivered more than 500,000 units to over 30 customers who appreciate outright performance leadership.
The data center is central to our strategy and is a remarkable opportunity. By 2021 we expect the data center to be a $65 billion silicon opportunity, and we're less than 40% of the total available segment today. As we build out the adjacencies like Ethernet, Silicon Photonics and 3D XPoint memory and pull them all together with rack scale design, we'll be positioned to deliver even higher levels of performance and efficiency to our customers and increase our percentage of the total TAM.
The Client Computing Group also delivered fantastic results. Revenue was up 12% over last year as product leadership combined with a disciplined segmentation strategy led to rising Core mix. We along with our customers and partners in the PC supply chain are driving the evolution of the PC experience, as users seek out high performance and new form factors. We launched the powerful new Intel Core X-series processor family including a new Core i9 Extreme Edition processor, extending our performance leadership. And we'll be shipping our first 10-nanometer products near the end of the year beginning with a lower volume SKU and followed by multiple SKUs and a volume ramp in the first half of 2018. We've seen some modest improvements in the PC consumption but we continue to expect a mid single digit TAM decline for the full year.
We also began shipping our next generation 4G LTE modem known as the 7480 to customers. As I mentioned earlier, we're continuing to make great progress with our wireless ecosystem, laying the groundwork for 5G, and starting in 2018, Intel will partner on what is expected to be the first 5G showcase at the Olympic games.
In our Internet of Things business, we're focused on four key verticals, retail, video, industrial and transportation. We saw strong growth across all four, leading to a 26% increase in revenue. We're specifically excited to see the ramp of our IVI designs with both Jaguar Land Rover and Toyota.
We're also about to mark a very important milestone in our transformation. We expect to close the acquisition of Mobileye in the third quarter, several months earlier than expected. Autonomous driving is a massive compute workload that will disrupt industries and save lives and we are investing to win in this important segment.
I'm excited to welcome the Mobileye team to Intel. Together, we expect to be the global leader in the $70 billion autonomous driving systems, data and services market opportunity by accelerating auto industry innovation and delivering cloud to car solutions faster and at a lower cost. And we're looking forward to talking with you in more detail about our plans and the progress we're making in this segment later this quarter.
Memory and FPGAs round out our priorities for the year. Our memory business grew 58% over last year, setting an all-time revenue record. A cornerstone for our strategy in this segment is differentiated technology. And that differentiation was on display earlier this month when we announced availability of the industry's first, and to date only, 64-layer 3D NAND SSDs. Our floating gate architecture already enabled industry-leading density at 32 layers. And we believe our density lead is even greater at 64. We also shipped more than 200,000 units of our revolutionary Optane memory for clients, which are available via our OEM partners and channel partners and have more than 50 data center customers testing Optane SSDs currently which will ship for revenue this year, Optane DIMMs remaining on track for availability next year.
Our memory factory, Fab 68, continues to exceed expectations, ramping ahead of schedule in terms of both output and yield. This will be a big part of our overall supply growth in the second half, which we expect to be greater than 20%. The combination of strong execution and favorable market conditions is accelerating our path to profitability. Core NAND returned to profitability this quarter ahead of our earlier estimate and we expect it to remain profitable for the balance of the year. We also now expect the entire NSG segment to be profitable for the full year of 2018 versus our prior end of 2018 target.
Lastly, our FPGA business was down 5% over last year on weaker data center and comms sectors, but remains on track to our mid single digit growth target for the full year, with broad reacceleration in the second half across markets, including the Data Center segment.
At their Build Conference in May, Microsoft disclosed a major advancement in the deployment of Intel FPGAs resulting in the industry's fastest public cloud network and new technology for acceleration of deep neural networks. Audi selected Intel for the Level 3 autonomous driving system in its upcoming A8 where our Cyclone V SoC FPGA technology will perform object and map fusion as well as parking pilot and sensor data pre-processing. We're also seeing strong adoption of our 14-nanometer Stratix 10 FPGAs. We continue to gain key design wins in our focus segments, and we're on track to production later this year.
To sum it up, I'm very pleased with our progress, and I'm more confident than ever in Intel's future and growth. Based on our strong first half and higher expectations for the PC business and the expected close of Mobileye, we're raising our full-year revenue forecast from $60 billion to $61.3 billion and our non-GAAP EPS forecast from $2.85 to $3.00.
We continue to see intense competition across our businesses. That's the reality of the attractive markets in which we participate. The competition makes us stronger, and we're ready for it. We're executing well to our strategy to transform from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company that powers the cloud and billions of smart and connected devices.
The PC TAM is down more than 15% versus four years ago. Despite that headwind, our revenue is up more than 15% and our operating profit has grown more than 30%. More than 40% of our revenue now comes from our data-centric businesses outside the PC sector. And those businesses together are growing at double-digit rates. And while we're growing the top line, we're intensely focused on operating efficiency. We now expect spending as a percent of revenue to decline about 160 basis points versus last year, bringing it below 34%, on track to the 30% goal we're committed to, to hit by 2020.
And with that, I'd like to hand it over to Bob.
Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp.
Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon.
Like Brian said, we had an outstanding quarter and executed on several important milestones. Revenue was $14.8 billion, up 14% year over year excluding the Intel Security Group. From an earnings perspective, operating income was $4.2 billion, up 30% year over year, and EPS of $0.72 was up 22% year over year. Our EPS performance was the result of strong top line growth, good gross margin improvement, and excellent spending leverage.
From a capital allocation perspective, we generated $4.7 billion in cash flow from operations, returned $2.6 billion to shareholders, and have capital in place to fund the Mobileye acquisition.
The planned acquisition of Mobileye, which will fuel our growth in the automotive segment, is expected to close in Q3, well ahead of our schedule.
At our Analyst Day in February, we talked about our strategy to transform from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company, a company well positioned to power the cloud and the billions of smart and connected devices. Our Q2 results demonstrate its continued momentum in our transformation, with the data-centric businesses, those outside of the PC segment, up 16% year over year. Our PC-centric business executed extremely well in a declining market and was up 12%. Our data-centric businesses are more than 40% of the company's overall revenue.
Moving to earnings, we are seeing broad growth across the business, driving 4 points of operating margin leverage and 22% EPS growth year over year. Earnings growth is driven by strong top line growth for both the PC and data-centric businesses, improving unit costs with 14-nanometer ramp, and gains from a sale of a portion of our equity investment in ASML.
On our Q1 earnings call, Brian and I talked about our commitment to achieving spending target of approximately 30% of revenue no later than 2020. We made great progress in the second quarter, as total spending was down 330 basis points year over year. We've continued investments in our key priorities, including artificial intelligence, autonomous driving, and Moore's Law, while at the same time capturing benefits of our previously announced restructuring program and significant leverage from strong top line growth.
R&D spending was down 1 point, and our SG&A costs were down 2.2 points. On a full-year basis, we expect direct spending to be below 34%, approximately 0.5 point better than our prior guidance.
Let me touch briefly on our segment performance on slide 5. The Client Computing Group had another outstanding quarter. Revenue of $8.2 billion was up 12% year over year. Client ASPs were up 8% year over year, as we continue to see strength in our gaming segment and strong Core mix.
We also continue to see the worldwide supply chain operate at healthy levels. This segment had another quarter of significant profit growth, with operating profit growing 58% from a year ago. And the business continues to execute and benefit from continued improvements in 14-nanometer unit costs, richer product mix, and lower spending.
Moving to slide 6, the Data Center Group had revenue of $4.4 billion, up 9% year over year. The Data Center Group had operating profit of $1.7 billion, down 6% year over year. As Brian mentioned earlier, we had strong growth in both the comms and cloud service provider segments, which are nearly 60% of our DCG revenue. Operating margin percent was impacted by increased technology development costs and higher artificial intelligence and adjacency spending. Versus the first quarter, our revenue accelerated 3% and our operating margin improved by 3 points. We are on track to our full-year guide of revenue growth in the high single digits and operating margin of over 40% for the full year.
The IoT, NSG, and PSG business segments are well positioned to capitalize on the explosion of data and are becoming a larger component of our overall business, growing 28% year over year. Our Internet of Things business achieved revenue of $720 million, growing 26% year over year, driven by strength in industrial and video and continued momentum in our automotive business. Operating profit was $139 million, up 56% year over year on higher volume and ASPs offset by continued investment in automotive.
Our memory business had record revenue of $874 million, up 58% year over year, with strong demand from data center SSD solutions and demand signals outpacing supply. This segment had an operating loss of $110 million, largely driven by costs associated with 3D XPoint and start-up costs for our memory capacity. Our memory fab in Dalian continues to make great progress and is ramping several weeks ahead of schedule. Yields continue to improve and unit costs are well ahead of expectations.
The core NAND business returned to profitability in the second quarter, and we expect the core NAND business to be profitable for the full year and the memory business as a whole to be profitable in 2018, both ahead of our prior estimates.
The Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $440 million, down 5% year over year. Operating profit was $97 million, flat year over year after acquisition-related impacts. We're making good progress in realizing cost synergies with the integration of this business.
Moving to slide 8, let me remind you of our capital allocation priorities and progress. Our priorities, first, invest in the business; second, strategic acquisitions; and third, return cash to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks. As I mentioned earlier, in the quarter, we generated $4.7 billion of cash from operations. We purchased $2.8 billion in capital assets, paid $1.3 billion in dividends and repurchased about $1.3 billion of stock.
In addition, we received cash of approximately $900 million as a portion of our Intel Security divestiture. And we generated approximately $1.3 billion from the sales of some of our interest in ASML, which generated $796 million of pre-tax gains. At quarter end, cash and long-term investments was $34 billion, up $11 billion, and total debt was $32 billion. Offshore cash investments and proceeds from the sale of our ASML investments are being used to fund the Mobileye acquisition.
Now, let me turn to guidance on slide 9. Some context. First, while we see slightly higher PC TAM and supply chain inventory replenishment contributing to higher expectations for annual revenue, we continue to take a more cautious view of PC consumption versus third-party analysts. Second, we continue to see strong demand signals in our memory business through the year, and we expect memory fab in Dalian to support higher second half demand levels. And third, as I mentioned earlier, we expect to close the acquisition of Mobileye in the third quarter, and as such, are including expectations for this business into our guidance.
Based on these factors, we are raising our full year revenue guidance by $1.3 billion to $61.3 billion, operating income guidance by $600 million to $17.9 billion, and EPS guidance by $0.15 to $3 per share. The improvement in revenue outlook is driven by a strong first half, higher expectations of the PC business and the inclusion of Mobileye.
The improvement in operating margin is primarily driven by our increased revenue outlook. Our outlook for full year spending is $20.7 billion as we expect modest increases related to revenue growth and the integration of Mobileye.
The increase in EPS is driven by higher expectations of revenue, coupled with gains on sale of our equity investments and the inclusion of Mobileye. We expect Mobileye to contribute approximately $200 million of revenue, $100 million of operating income, and $0.02 of EPS in the second half of the year.
And on slide 11 (sic) [10], as we look to the third quarter of 2017, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $15.7 billion, up 3% year-over-year excluding Intel Security Group. And we expect operating income of $4.8 billion and EPS to be approximately $0.80.
2017 is shaping up to be another record year for Intel. We feel great about where we are six months into our three-year transformation. We exceeded our EPS expectations for Q2, and increased our profit expectations for the full year.
At the same time, we are investing to compete and win in an expanding market fueled by the growth of data. We are already seeing an impact from our data-centric oriented businesses, up double digits collectively, as we continue to transform the company from a PC-centric company to a company of smart and connected devices that power the cloud.
With that, let me turn it over to Mark.
Mark H. Henninger - Intel Corp.
All right, thank you, Brian and Bob. Moving on now to the Q&A. As is our normal practice, we would ask each participant to ask one question and a follow up, if you have one. Crystal, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Our first question comes from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Your line is open.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hey. Thanks for taking my question and nice results. I was curious on the data center business, maybe you can talk about the growth you they sequentially in the back half to get to that high single digits for the year. Maybe you can just talk about it by segment. I know cloud was up a lot in Q2, enterprise down. Talk about it by segment as well as the contribution from Scalable into those segments. What's the right timing to think about as those ramp in?
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
Sure. Thanks, Blayne, for the question. So I'll start and Bob can add some comments at the end. We think the data center continues to be just a great growth engine for the company. And you saw the 9% growth this quarter. What we have really been also focusing on at the same time is really increasing operating margin, and I want to make that point. You saw our operating margin increase to 38% this quarter. You'll see us continue to raise that operating margin so that we're back at the 40% plus operating margin for the back half and for the year.
So first wanted to lay that groundwork. What we've projected for the second half is quarters that are pretty much in line. We continue to expect enterprise to continue to decline. It declined a bit more in the second quarter than I think we had really projected. It declined at about 11%. But if you look at Q1, it declined a little less than we expected at 3%. But we still expect it to decline in those high single digit numbers. Cloud though, and grew greater than we what expected at 36%. We expect it to be in the mid 20s, probably more likely. And then networking and comms, 17% and the adjacencies at 12%.
So we expect that trend to continue. We don't need any big shifts in those trends to really get to that high single digit growth rate for the data center. We talked about Xeon Scalable. The initial reaction has been extremely positive. You see the largest number of prequalification samples sent out to customers. You see the cloud applications. We try to talk about it's the largest performance improvement in a decade, gen to gen. So we're seeing a very large ramp in the second half as we move on with the Xeon Scalable. And so I think that's what's going to fuel second half 2017, and then but it's going to continue on into 2018 as well. So I think that's how we see the second half playing out.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Thanks, and then -
Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp.
The only thing I would add, Brian, is we came into the year looking at high single digit growth for the business and margins expanding quarter by quarter throughout the year, and two months in we see nice acceleration on both top and bottom line. And as we go into the second half of the year, we're comfortable with the full year outlook that we've given. And the only dynamic other than the things Brian highlighted is Q3 comps are a little tougher as we go into the second half of the year, but we feel good about the mix of the business as we go through 2017 and beyond.
Just to reiterate a point Brian said, with the strong cloud growth and the strong performance in the comms and networking space, we now generate 60% of our revenues from the higher growth aspects of the business. So we think that bears well for us in 2017 but also going into 2018 and beyond.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Thanks. And then I did want to ask you on the memory side, you looking for breakeven next year. What is driving that? Obviously, memory pricing has been strong, but I was just wondering if there's any other factors you're now adding into that outlook?
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
Sure. So let's make sure we clarify, right, so on traditional NAND, we are breakeven this year. And we broke even actually this quarter, and we expect to remain there the rest of the year. When we talk about for next year, that's inclusive of 3D XPoint. And so the difference is really as we ramp products on through the XPoint and as we ramp out the rest of Fab 68, both of those. Whenever you're ramping a factory, because you have a certain amount of underutilization of the equipment just as you start to get it going, you tend to have slightly higher costs. And so that's what you see as the driver for the rest of the profitability growth as we go into next year.
I want to also say that the 64-tier NAND products gives us a cost and performance advantage just because they're leading edge products as well that is going to play into as we move through the remainder of this year and next year. So it's 64-tier products on traditional NAND, the ramp-out of Fab 68, and then the real startup and continuation in getting the rest of the products qualified on 3D XPoint is what gets us – everything profitable next year.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hi, thanks for letting me ask a question. Brian, I wanted to follow up the data center side that Blayne just asked about and get a little bit more color about the acceleration on the cloud side and the deceleration on the enterprise side. If you could give any more color on why you think those were at the extremes and why do you think they normalize going forward, it would be helpful.
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
I don't want to say that they're going to ""normalize"". In fact, there's not going to be a major shift. The trend of – look, enterprise is going to continue to decline. We estimate, and again, this is just based on what we get from our customers, talking to the industry. It's going be in the high single-digit decline. I think you'll see quarters like Q2 that was 11%. You'll see quarters like Q1 that were 3% or 4%. We've seen quarters higher than the 11% over the last couple years. So it's going be lumpy as we see this shift, but the overall macro shift of enterprise to cloud or traditional on-prem systems to cloud is going to continue.
I think we'll also see, we still again, talking to our partners, thinking that mid-20% for cloud growth, but I think we'll see quarters like this quarter that was a little bit high. Other quarters we've had in the past have been more in line. So I don't think we're talking about something going normalizing. I'd say it's still going to stay relatively lumpy like this. But if you look at it over the long haul, even when you look at the first half of the year, 11% down this quarter, 3% down last quarter, you take a look at those on average and you get to that high single-digit number. So I still feel like that's going to be roughly about where it goes down, and then the cloud will continue to grow at that rate plus additional as more of the growth goes into the cloud.
Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp.
The only thing I'd add, Brian, is the supply/demand imbalance of SSDs in the quarter we believe had an impact on the enterprise sector. And as that supply/demand imbalance normals out, we think that will help. But all that being said, the trends Brian highlighted is still how we see the workloads playing out over time.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
That's very helpful. I guess for my follow-up if I can shift gears over to the margin side of things, and specifically the fall-through. It was great to see that you guys beat your OpEx guidance for the second quarter. As we think about the full year with revenues going up, why isn't gross margin changing at all? And then the OpEx increase ex-Mobileye, is that just the variable comp that comes in with bonuses et cetera, or is there something else in that roughly $150 million increase to your spending line?
Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp.
Just on the second one first, the short answer is yes. The combination of the incremental growth and the addition of Mobileye are the primary drivers for the slightly higher spend.
Your initial comment on flow-through, to put it into context, from where we were in January, our full-year outlook, the revenue is up roughly $1.8 billion. And with that $1.8 billion, there will be roughly $200 million of costs, primarily Mobileye. So in context, we feel like we're managing the cost and spending side of the business effectively as we position to a 30% spending of revenue by 2020 at the latest.
In terms of the gross margin dynamics, I think the trends that you've seen over the last couple quarters we expect to continue through the year. And it's really ASP improvements, good unit cost performance, volume leverage through the fab working in our favor. And on the flip side, the strong growth of the memory and the modem business and the ramp costs for 10-nanometer are partial offsets. Those dynamics are what has driven the strong gross margins in the 63% range in the first half, and we expect those same dynamics to play out in the second half as well.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your line is open.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you for taking my question. Brian, for my first one, my question is on the competitive landscape in the data center. There's been a lot of discussion about AMD perhaps posing more competition than it has in the last several years. And I appreciate it's early days and you have a very strong product out, but are you hearing about them more in your customer conversations? Is that a more real threat than it has been in the past? Because they did have an event, they did show up with 10-plus potential customers. And in some of the benchmark data, they are showing some performance that is perhaps better at a lower price. So how real is that competition and how are you reacting to it?
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
Sure, Vivek. I think in general, we see competition across almost every one of our platforms, whether it be in the data center or in the client business, and it's come from a variety of sources.
You're right, AMD has raised up a bit with their more recent products, but you see us responding. This is a traditional performance battle that we're very accustomed to, and we're comfortable in reacting and competing very aggressively in. And so you see us coming out with our Xeon Scalable. You'll see us make maneuvers like we accelerate our Core i9 products, which are all the way up to 18 thread systems on the client based products. So I'd tell you that yes, we're seeing increased competitive pressure from a variety of places. But that actually will just drive us even harder, make us better in the end. And we're comfortable that we can make the right products to deliver the right performance against those.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
And as my follow-up, Brian, if you could give us a little bit more color on your 10-nanometer progress. What is the timing of products around that node? And as part of that, if Bob could remind us how the CapEx and depreciation and OpEx for that node are flowing through the financials. Thank you.
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
Sure, so on 10-nanometers we are sampling, engineering samples to customers currently. The yields on 10-nanometers are continuing to improve pretty much right in line with the forecasted ramp rates. It's a new technology, so you always have some problems to get solved but we're pretty comfortable with where we're at right now. Like we said in the earnings script, we are set to qualify the first production products right towards the end of the year. You'll see those start to ship in the first half of next year and you'll see a ramp of SKUs.
One of the things we're seeing is each one of these technologies, and actually products that we generate, we're generating quite a few more SKUs, Vivek. And so you'll see a variety of SKUs progressing through 2018 as we ramp the 10-nanometer products, starting with the, I'll call it, more simpler SKUs at the beginning, going all the way through the high performance, high complexity SKUs towards the middle and back half of the year. Which is it's a traditional ramp like you see us push out on a new product ramp.
Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp.
And then just in terms of the capital, yes, just as a reminder, our full year outlook for CapEx is roughly $12 billion. We did indicate that approximately $2.5 billion of that would be for memory. So underlying that, you have $9.5 billion dollars CapEx for the logic business. For 10-nanometer and specifically you have TD lines and pilot lines going in this year and beginning to scale as we match the capacity with the production that scales in the first half and second half of next year. So that's reflected in the CapEx guide and the depreciation guide that we gave you earlier in the year and that hasn't really changed.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is open.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I had a question on the trajectory of data center growth into the second half. And to be honest, I'm still wondering why you don't think you can do better than high single digits. I mean I know you're calling out the tough comp in Q3 but it's only like 10%, right, which is roughly in line with full year guide and it's below the longer-term CAGR. So you're going to see comps at that level or higher kind of into perpetuity. I guess why call that out as an excuse? And what are the issues in terms of hoping and driving for a bigger lift in the second half versus what you're still currently guiding for with the Skylake-SP launch on its way?
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
So I think, Stacy, first, we're quite proud of the growth rate we're seeing and especially the growth rates in the growth segments. We're forecasting mid 20s for the cloud business, the networking and storage business and adjacencies on down. What we're having to counter is not only the comps that Bob talked about, but the declining function of the enterprise, right. And so those two things counter those growth rates. Now, as the enterprise continues to shrink, it will become less and less moving forward. So we agree that over time, this will become a smaller and smaller impact to the growth rates. But right now, it's still a large enough percentage. It weighs on our ability to get the growth rate higher.
Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp.
Yes, and I would, if I sounded like I was giving an excuse, I maybe should just correct that. We feel great about where we are, first half up 7%, full year up high single digits, profit expanded during the course of the year and continuing to win in those segments of the market that have differentiated growth rates. So six months into the year, we feel good about where we are and we're excited about the new product that we launched.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Got it. For my follow-up, on the PC side of things, I know you said that the channel's healthy, but it sounds like you also had channel fill in the quarter and it's also included in the guide going forward. So, I guess if the channel's healthy, why is there inventory filling up and what does that imply as we kind of get through the year and look into next year for the likely trajectory of your products' sales into that market?
Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp.
I think as we look at kind of the quarter performance – well, I should start with kind of the TAM overall, and Brian highlighted this in the prepared remarks. We have assumed that PC TAM will continue to decline in the mid single digits for the full year, and on the margin, that might be a little better today than it was six months ago. But we're not counting on a dramatic change in the PC TAM consumption for the year.
That being said, we've taken up our guidance quite a bit. So in that, there's a stronger Q2 performance with a little bit of more healthy inventory channels as we go into the second half of the year. So, if the inventory was maybe a little bit leaner over the last three to four quarters, I think we'd characterize them in the healthy level now. And we think the ecosystem is building for a second half that's consistent with our outlook for PC TAM.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
And it needs to build inventory to do that?
Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp.
Say it again.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
And it needs to build inventory to do that?
Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp.
I think the inventory levels, as we see it in the channel, is slightly higher than the lean levels they've been for the last couple quarters, but no dramatic difference from our perspective on how we see PC TAM for the full year.

Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the questions. Congratulations on the solid results. Brian, I apologize if I missed this in your prepared comments. My first question is just around pricing in DCG. It was down about 1% sequentially. There's always a lot of mix things there. You usually have some commentary about ASPs per bucket. Were they still strong? And I guess more importantly, as you think about the product launches in the back half of the year, at least some of our initial checks are suggesting that the customers are kind of chomping at the bit to buy higher up into the stack, which could drive some good ASPs. Can you talk about your expectations around ASPs and/or attach rates for adjacency data center businesses with the launch of the Xeon Scalable?
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
Sure, John. So we expect the second half of 2017, from an ASP perspective, to be pretty much what you've seen in the past, where ASPs continue to increase on the various platforms of Xeon, right. So looking at each one, you'll see ASPs overall increasing. What you're seeing on this is a little bit of mix, right, so as you saw, networking and storage grow at 17%, the adjacencies at 12%. Those are starting to become a little bit more a percentage of that business and those draw down the overall ASPs a little bit. But if you look within just the Xeon core function, those ASPs continue to increase at about the normal rates that you'd expect, especially as you move into a new architecture like Xeon Scalable.
John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
That's helpful. And then for my follow-on, just turning to the Client Compute Group, your ability to sort of segment that market and drive higher mix has been sort of a multiyear endeavor with a lot of success. What inning do you think you guys are in in that process, especially with AMD coming to market with new products? Is there still a mix, a potential story here, and what would drive that?
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
I actually think there is. So I think if you take a look at this, John, what's driven this has not been clever segmentation necessarily. It's been the ability to segment into specific markets and specific performance. And so things like Core i9 are a good example where you're really targeting performance. And so what I believe is that what the growth areas in the client space, gaming, virtual reality, thin and light, they're requiring performance and power. And remember those are always somewhat tradeable as you take a look at this.
And so those trends are going to continue, and that's why that's as we talked about, how do you feel about competition, where do you see competition playing. We believe our leadership and performance will continue to allow that trend to continue and continue to allow the trend within CCG to continue as well. And that's part of what drove the forecast for the second half.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Romit Shah from Nomura Securities. Your line is open.
Romit Shah - Nomura Securities International
Yes. Thanks so much for letting me ask a question. It looks like this is the fifth consecutive quarter that CCG beat expectations. Revenues were up 12%, and I think there's a debate out there as to whether or not you deserve credit for this performance with skeptics really pointing to sustainability more than anything else. And when you break down that 12% as you guys mentioned, ASPs are a big part of the increase. My question is, as you look at the mix in that business overall, is there room to drive ASPs higher and effectively capture more value inside of the PC TAM?
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
So, yes is the simple answer, Romit. Remember this isn't necessarily us raising prices. So it's not we're out there going and saying okay, I'm going to charge $10 more for the next Core i7. It's actually the percentage of units that are being bought at those higher units, and we continue to deliver higher performance at the same price with each one of these generations.
So what you're seeing is actually an overall trend that, yes, units are down. We talked about that, both I and Bob, around TAM being down somewhere in that low to mid-single-digit range. And that's pretty much in line with what I'm seeing third parties here. Some third parties are a little bit better than that. But for the most part, we're within a couple of percent.
But yes, we believe that there is room for continued demand, for movement upwards. So the number of Core i7s. the number of Core i9s, the number of people buying the performance thin and light laptops, those are going to continue. And you see it in our OEM partners and the type of systems they are producing and the type of systems they're bringing to market. Now they are targeting that more and more as well.
Romit Shah - Nomura Securities International
You guys...
Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp.
The only thing I would add is, again, we have a business that has a declining market. It's growing not by raising prices, but to Brian's point by a market that increasingly values performance. And the operating margins of the business for the first half of the year were up over 50%. So this team through its segmentation is executing extremely well.
And then as we mentioned earlier, with that great margin performance, we are redeploying our resources to invest in these data-centric set of businesses that have high growth characteristics that collectively were up 16% again in the quarter. And through this journey of a PC TAM decline, we have a bigger business, a stronger business, and a more profitable business with an increasing portion, over 40%, coming from high-growth oriented businesses, so great performance in a declining market. Continuing to invest in it and reallocate across our portfolio, and feel good about the portfolio we have, and with the addition of Mobileye as we head into the second half of the year.
Romit Shah - Nomura Securities International
And in terms like, you obviously provide ASPs for CCG, but is the Core mix as a percentage of units a metric that we should be focusing on? And if I remember correctly, that percentage was close to 70%. I'm curious where it is today.
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
It's continuing to climb. It is, but don't forget even within that Core mix, Romit, you have the ability to continue to scale up. So Core i3 versus Core i5 versus Core i7 and now we've introduced the Core i9, which is even higher performance.
Romit Shah - Nomura Securities International
Okay.
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
So we saw early on people choosing Core over Pentium or Atom, for example, and you saw the Core mix move up. You're now seeing not only that continue to climb, but you're going to see within Core the amount of Core i7s, Core i9s, Core i5s continue to climb as well.
Romit Shah - Nomura Securities International
Got it.
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
And that's why we continue to see that there are legs behind this. And you said are we getting credit for this, so we don't think when you look overall this business, last year's performance with great growth in all of the segments. You look at this year's performance so far in the first half and our projections now in the second half, we think that our ability to segment, to drive better operating margin, and to continue to drive performance into the PC and keep it more and more profitable while we invest and grow these other businesses, we think that there's an option around Intel that is quite good.
Mark H. Henninger - Intel Corp.
Thanks, Romit.

Operator
Thank you. And our last question comes from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the solid execution. In DCG, you guys are probably full throttle from a manufacturing perspective for Xeon Scalable or Skylake in the June quarter. But my question is how much of the data center growth in June was the initial production revenue shipments of Xeon Scalable to your customers, or did that contribute just very little to the June quarter mix?
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
Okay. Yes, it's very little. We don't give out exact percentages by SKU like that. But I can genuinely tell you that it is really just the beginning of the ramp of the Xeon Scalable. And so its impact into Q2 was minimal at best. What you'll see is, as it ramps into the second half, it becomes a higher and higher percentage, and really the big volume is going be 2018. So that's when it really takes over from the way the data center looks from a revenue and profit standpoint.
What we're excited about is we talked about the 500,000 units that are out there. That was the highest number of pre-samples. That shows you the demand by the big infrastructure guys around the performance. They were willing to take the product even before, quote, we were ready to start shipping it. And then the number of records we've broken already in performance, we talked about 50 records worldwide already. Those are laying the groundwork for how this ramp is going look and feel as we move into the second half and into 2018.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great, thanks for the insights there. And good to see the profitability in the NAND segment. In enterprise SSD, I think you guys are still number two global market share leader there. And it looks like based on the first half performance, you guys are outpacing the market. So I guess the question is where is the team winning. Is it high capacity? Is it high performance for these enterprise and cloud drives? And similar to maybe some of your peers, is the team currently capacity constrained?
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
Sure. So our whole strategy around the memory is that we are focused on differentiation and performance and specifically around supporting the data center. We do sell into client as well but that's not the main focus of this business. And so I'd tell you when we talk about our growth and when we talk about our projections for the rest of this year and why we're investing in the future, that 64-tier NAND gives us the ability to be a better cost but the high performance end. So we're not going after commodity SSDs that you're going to see even in high-end workstations necessarily. It's really focused towards the data center products.
Even still, there's not all SSDs and data centers are high-end performance. So we're comfortable with where we are in a market share. We want to balance those investments against the demand for these high performance areas and make sure we keep that in balance. And our real goal is then to move more and more of the business towards the 3D XPoint as we move into next year because that really differentiates us again as we really change the hierarchy between memory and storage as the data center DIMM memory systems come out.

Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Intel Corporation Q1 2017 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Mark Henninger, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Mark H. Henninger - Intel Corp.
Thank you, Crystal, and welcome, everyone, to Intel's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. By now you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with it. If you've not received both documents, they are available on our Investor Website intc.com. I'm joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO and Bob Swan, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment we'll hear brief remarks from both of them followed by Q&A.
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.
A brief reminder that this quarter we have provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Today we'll be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The CFO commentary and earnings release available on intc.com include the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations.
And finally, I'd like to draw your attention to a change we've made to our guidance practices for the current quarter and full year. Beginning with today's earnings release for the first quarter of 2017, our business outlook will speak only as of the date of our quarterly earnings releases, bringing our practices in line with virtually all of our peers.
With that, let me hand it over to Brian.
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
Thanks, Mark. The first quarter marked a great start to the year coming off both Q4 and full-year records in 2016. Q1 revenue was up 7% over the first quarter of last year, a record Q1. And operating margin was up 20%. It was another milestone in our transformation from a PC-centered company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart and connected devices. Average selling prices, or ASPs, grew meaningfully across our PC, data center and IoT business, reflecting the market's demand for performance and our segmentation strategy, and our memory business set an all-time record revenue.
At our investor meeting in February, I outlined our strategy to make Intel the driving force of the data revolution across technologies and industries. I also detailed our top four priorities for the year: growing the data center and adjacencies, ensuring a strong and healthy PC business, growing IoT and devices, and executing flawlessly in memory and FPGAs. That's the framework we're using to measure our success throughout the year, and I'd like to take a few minutes to assess our progress so far.
First the data center and its adjacencies. DCG grew 6% year over year despite a headwind resulting from a 14-week first quarter last year. The cloud service provider revenue was up 18%. The comms service provider segment was up 12%. And enterprise was down 3%, while non-CPU adjacencies grew more than 20% across all of the segments. Data center microprocessor ASPs were up in total across every product line, underscoring the market's demand for performance to transmit, aggregate and analyze data. We're also on track for mid-summer launch of our next-generation Skylake microprocessor. Skylake delivers significant performance gains across a wide range of workloads.
For example, Skylake will include AVX-512 extensions that will deliver a 2x improvement in floating-point operations per clock over the current generation, a gain that will have an especially high impact on HPC and artificial intelligence workloads. And last month we announced the formation of the Artificial Intelligence Product Group, bringing together all of our AI hardware and software assets and all of our AI engineering expertise across the company into a single group to accelerate our development of a full stack of AI solutions, and explore novel approaches that will shape the next generation of AI products.
Second, a strong and healthy Client business. Our annual cadence of product innovation, combined with a thoughtful segmentation strategy, continued to produce strong mix, which drove higher ASPs. This trend, along with our ramping modem business, drove revenue up 6% and operating margin up 60% over last year. Our expectations for the PC unit TAM haven't changed since we last talked with you. We're expecting a mid-single digit percentage decline in the unit TAM. Our ASPs, however, are trending ahead of expectations and are contributing to our slightly higher revenue expectations for the full year.
Third, we highlighted the importance of growing the IoT business as we drive, and benefit from the rise of billions of smart and connected devices. IoTG revenue was up 11% year over year, where we saw strength in our industrial, video and automotive segments. We also announced our intention to acquire Mobileye, a highly profitable, fast-growing leader in computer vision for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving. The transaction will combine Mobileye's expertise in computer vision with Intel's expertise in high-performance computing, artificial intelligence and connectivity. Together we expect to be the global leader in the $70 billion autonomous driving systems, data and services opportunity by accelerating auto industry innovation and delivering cloud-to-car solutions faster and at a lower cost.
And, finally, we emphasized the execution in memory and FPGAs. Our memory business grew 55% year over year in a tight supply environment, while Fab 68, our Dalian factory, continues to ramp 3D NAND production and is delivering outstanding product yields. We also shipped our first Optane SSDs for the data center and our Optane memory solution, which is available online now and in PC OEM systems later this quarter.
In our Programmable Solutions Group, revenue declined 7% over the last year after adjusting for acquisition-related accounting charges in the first quarter of 2016. The year-over-year decline was due to weakness in the data center and comm segment, partially offset by growth in industrial and auto and consumer. We also announced an important pilot program with Alibaba Cloud, the cloud computing arm of Alibaba Group, for our cloud-based FPGA acceleration service.
We're making good progress against our four top priorities for the year and our transformation goals. We're improving the profitability and health of our PC business. At the same time, our investments in the data center, IoT, memory and FPGAs are paying off with significant combined revenue growth. These are purposeful investments that will position Intel for years to come. At the same time, we recognize that there is an opportunity and a responsibility to be more focused and efficient as a company, a goal we can achieve without compromising our most important investments, our transformation or our future.
Focus was one of our objectives in establishing McAfee as an independent cyber-security company just weeks ago. And it is with efficiency in mind that we're making an important commitment to our owners today. We are establishing a spending target of approximately 30% of revenue, which we expect to reach no later than 2020. Following a 1 percentage point improvement from 2015 to 2016, we forecasted additional 1 percentage point improvement in spending in 2017 and we're now expecting to do a little better than that. While we expect revenue growth to a play role in achieving these targets, hitting this goal will require spending discipline and an intense focus on our strategic priorities.
To sum up the quarter, we're off to a good start and executing well against our priorities. We're delivering a steady cadence of leading products, a powerful segmentation strategy and growing profitability in our Client business. We're growing our Data Center, IoT, and Memory businesses as customers see data as a competitive advantage and look to Intel as a partner that can help them create, analyze and unlock the value of massive and growing flood of data. And finally, we are committing ourselves to a set of important new productivity goals intended to create value for our owners.
With that I'll hand it over to Bob.
Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp.
Thanks, Brian. 2016 was a record year for Intel and 2017 is off to a strong start. We executed on several important milestones in the quarter. We delivered on innovative product and technology roadmaps across the business, Fab 68 in Dalian continued its impressive ramp, and Intel's transformation continued with the planned acquisition of Mobileye for autonomous driving and the sale of the Intel Security Group.
Revenue was $14.8 billion, up 7% year over year. Operating income was $3.9 billion, up 20% year over year, and earnings per share of $0.66 was up 22% year over year. Our EPS performance was a result of strong top line growth and significant margin expansion. First quarter operating margin was 27%, up 3 points year over year, and gross margin came in at 63% up 0.5 points year over year. Direct spending came in at $5.4 billion, flat year over year and down 2 points as a percent of revenue from 2016 as we continued to execute on our restructuring program.
Let me touch briefly on our segment performance. The Client Computing Group had revenue of $8 billion, up 6% year over year. We continue to see the worldwide PC supply chain operate at healthy levels. Client ASPs were up 7% year over year as our segmentation strategies are paying off and core mix continues to be strong. This segment had yet another quarter of significant profit growth with operating profit growing over 60% from a year ago as the business continues to execute and benefit from continued improvements in 14-nanometer unit cost, richer product mix and lower spending, primarily from the Client business having a decreased share of technology development and SG&A allocations.
The Data Center Group had revenue of $4.2 billion, up 6% year over year. The Data Center Group had operating profit of $1.5 billion, down 16% year over year. Operating margin percent was impacted by increased allocation of technology development and SG&A costs, higher product costs as we transition to 14-nanometer and the ramp of adjacency products.
Our Internet of Things business achieved revenue of $721 million, growing 11% year over year driven by strength in the industrial and video segments and continued momentum in our automotive business. Operating profit for the business was $105 million, down 15% year over year from increased investments in autonomous driving and increased allocation of SG&A and technology development spending.
Our Memory business had record revenue of $866 million, up 55% year over year with strong demand for data center SSD solutions and demand signals outpacing supply. We continue to make outstanding progress ramping Fab 68 with yields and unit costs well ahead of expectations. This segment had an operating loss of $129 million, largely driven by costs associated with 3D XPoint and startup costs for our memory capacity.
The Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $425 million. Operating profit was $92 million, flat year over year after adjusting for acquisition related impacts.
Our Intel Security Group business had revenue of $534 million and operating profit was $95 million. Consistent with our prior guidance the Intel Security transaction closed at the beginning of the second quarter.
Let me remind you of our capital allocation priorities and our progress. First, invest in our business, second, strategic acquisitions and third, return cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. In the quarter we generated $3.9 billion of cash from operations. We repurchased $2 billion in capital assets, paid $1.2 billion in dividends, increased the dividend by 5% and repurchased about $1.2 billion of stock.
In addition, we generated approximately $400 million from the sale of some of our interests in ASML, which generated $235 million of pre-tax gains. At quarter end, cash other long-term investments was $23.7 billion, up $600 million. Total debt was $25.8 billion.
Today we announced an increase in our share buyback authorization by $10 billion. Currently, we have approximately $15 billion authorization. We expect to continue to offset dilution from our stock-based programs and opportunistically reduce our outstanding share count over time.
Now let me turn to guidance. First, some context. First, while we see strong momentum and Client ASPs contributing to slightly higher expectations of revenue for the year, we continue to take a more cautious view of PC consumption versus third party analysts. We feel great about our annual cadence of product innovations with new product launches planned this year including Skylake for data center, eighth generation core, 64-tier 3D NAND SSDs and further extensions to our Optane product line.
Second, we continued to see strong demand signals in our memory business through the year and our Fab 68 in Dalian ramping to be able to supply higher demand levels. Third, the Data Center business has solid momentum with the mid-summer launch of our next-generation Skylake processor. And forth, as I indicated earlier, we completed the sale of the Intel Security Group. We expect to realize a pre-tax gain of approximately $375 million and a tax liability of approximately $850 million. This results in a GAAP tax rate of 39% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 21% in the second quarter.
And last, as Brian talked about earlier, we are committed to increasing efficiency as a company and we are making an important commitment to our owners today. We expect to reduce our spending as a percent of revenue by 2 points from 2015 to 2017 and our plans are to continue to drive efficiencies in how we operate the business over time. We are establishing a spending target of approximately 30% of revenue which we expect to reach no later than 2020.
As a result, we are raising our full-year revenue guidance by $500 million to approximately $60 billion and our EPS guidance by $0.05 to approximately $2.85 per share. As we look to the second quarter of 2017, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range of $14.4 billion, up 11% year over year excluding Intel Security and up 6% including Intel Security.
We expect operating margins to increase by 3 points year over year, gross margins to be up 1 point at approximately 63% and spending to be approximately $5.2 billion, flat year over year. We expect our spending as a percent of revenue to be down 2 points in the first half of the year versus last year, as we make solid progress in increasing efficiency in the company. We expect EPS to be approximately $0.68, up 15% year over year.
We feel pretty good about where we are 90 days into our three-year journey. We exceeded our expectations for Q1 and increased our profit expectations for the full year. At the same time, we are investing in the future by expanding our TAM from $45 billion to $220 billion. We are already seeing an impact, with our growth-oriented businesses up double digits collectively as we continue to transform the company from a PC-centric company to a company of smart and connected devices that power the cloud.
With that, let me turn it over to Mark.
Mark H. Henninger - Intel Corp.
All right, think you, Brian and Bob. Moving on now to the Q&A. As is our normal practice, we would ask each participant to ask one question and just one follow-up if you have one. Crystal, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Our first questioner comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The line is open.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you for taking my question. Brian, I'm curious on the Data Center growth. The growth rate is now below 6% in Q1. Are you still committed to the high single digit growth rate for this year? What will drive it? Is it just some pause ahead of the broader launch of the Skylake servers? If you could just give us some more color about why the growth rate is below trend right now and what will help it get back to trend later in the year and over the next few years.
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
Sure, Vivek. So the simple answer is absolutely, we're still committed to the high single digit growth for the year. If you take a look at it, as Bob and I both mentioned in the call, when you take a look at Q1 comparatives, one, Q1 of last year was 14 weeks. This year it's a normal 13 weeks. So you add that one extra week; that's a couple of percent that you're competing against in a year-over-year basis.
Secondly, Q1 tends to be our lowest quarter in general if you just look at our seasonality in the year for overall revenue and output and growth in the Data Center business. And so as we look out and we see, as you said, the ramp of Skylake in the second half, as we see the normal seasonality, we are absolutely committed to that high single digit growth rate for the rest of the year.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And as my follow-up, the very rich mix in PCs, ASPs were up very strongly. How sustainable is that? And are you seeing any effect of competition from AMD's product launches?
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
Sure, I'll start. Bob, you may want to jump in. Each quarter we come in here and say we're a little concerned about the sustainability of those high ASPs, and we continue to have that, so we always forecast. If you take a look at what we've forecasted for the remainder of the year, we've forecasted a slight decline in ASPs as we move through the year. Now, that said, we're continuing to improve our road map. We're continuing to pull in products, and the demand for those high-end, high-performance products, from 2-in-1s, gaming, high-end workstations, continues to grow faster than we are even able to project.
So right now we've forecasted a slight decline through the rest of the year, but we had strong demand for it in Q1. And we really believe that's a function of our products and our roadmap. From a competition standpoint, we're not seeing anything unusual right now as far as – there's always some level of competition in this market, and I'd tell you for Q1 and our forecast for Q2, we're not seeing anything out of the ordinary from what we normally see.
Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp.
Yeah, the only thing I would add, Brian, is with the ASPs being a little bit stronger than we expected in the first quarter, as we mentioned, we expect full-year revenue to be up $0.5 billion, versus where we were 90 days ago, and I would say one of the contributors to that is how we saw ASP trend in the first quarter of the year.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is open.
C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC
Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, in terms of your targeted 30% OpEx ratio by 2020, would love to hear what kind of revenue assumptions you're making as part of hitting that.
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
Sure. So I'll start. First I thought it would be good to give you a little background, right, why do we come out and commit this now, and what's our thinking behind this? And part of it is we had good progress, brought down spending as a percent of revenue about 1% for 2016. We're a quarter in, and we're seeing good progress in our efforts along 2017 of taking it down another slightly more than 1% as we look at this year.
And so we just really took a look at, do we think we can maintain that progress and continue to drive efficiencies while driving growth. The growth we've expected is what we talked about in the analyst meeting back in February, which is that mid-single digit type of growth for the overall company, and that's kind of where we're at from a growth perspective. And then the cost reduction and efficiencies are driving the rest of it.
Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp.
Yes. And I would just say that our focus is on growing the earnings performance for the company in the short, medium and long term. And what we laid out at Analyst Day, as Brian indicated, was over the next three years, low single digit growth, operating income growing faster than revenue and EPS growing faster than operating income. Against that, we're trying to obviously make revenue grow faster, continue to manage the efficiency in which we operate the company and drive strong earnings growth performance over the short, medium and long term. So the 30% target is consistent with kind of the three-year plan, and we know that there's opportunities for us to be more efficient as we go forward.
C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC
That's very helpful. I guess as my follow-up, was hoping to take a look at Memory. And here would love to hear from you as to how we should think about layering in depreciation from Dalian this year next, and when you would expect to turn a profit on the operating margin line.
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
Yeah, on the depreciation, we kind of implied in our guidance really no change on our depreciation through the course of the year, and what that assumes is roughly $2.5 billion additional CapEx from Memory in the year. In terms of profitability for this year, when we talked to you at Analyst Day, Rob kind of laid out a plan where the core 3D NAND would be profitable in the second half of the year, but our losses for the business would still be roughly in line with where we were in 2016. And that was a function of really three things, good performance on 3D NAND, continuing to ramp Dalian and continuing to invest in our Optane product or 3D XPoint. So those dynamics have us breaking even for the core business in the second half of the year. We said that near the end of 2018 as a whole, the Memory business would be profitable. And to the first quarter, growth was stronger than we expected and performance out of our fab was even better than we expected.
C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC
Thank you.
Mark H. Henninger - Intel Corp.
Thanks, C.J.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Your line is open.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to go back to the DCG growth and into your outlook in June, flat or slight growth overall. Is your expectations of the DCG would be similar to that? And then as you look out the whole year, you talked about cloud growth. I know tough compares, but 18%. Just curious, since you've been shipping early to these customers, what would be the timeframe that you would actually see some benefit from Skylake?
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
Sure, so I'm not exactly sure I completely understood your slight growth. What we said is for DCG as a business, we're in the high single digits growth rate, so we're absolutely committing to that. We talked about the 6% in Q1 and how, as we go through the year, we'll continue to grow.
From the standpoint we've been sampling Skylake to the cloud guys now for some period of time. In fact, back into the latter half of last year. But you really don't see the ramp of Skylake in volume at any of the customers, whether it be the cloud guys or the rest of the enterprise and networking and all until the second half. That's really when the volume kicks in on the server side, and that's absolutely what we had forecasted and there's no change in that forecast whatsoever.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Thanks. And then maybe if I could just ask, and I know you don't break it out any more, but just your view on your modem product this year and next, and if you could also maybe opine about your foundry strategy and opportunities there.
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
Sure, I can start with the modem and Bob can talk about – I'm not going to break it out financially. Bob can talk about, jump on top of this. But for us on our modem, it continues to gain momentum. We've talked about our one large customer, but we continue to get other interest in it. We are on schedule to bring our next generation modem into production in customer qualifications this year and really looking out over time. We have the next several series of modems over the next few years from an LTE perspective.
And then we're already working on and believe we're leading, if you looked at our output for the MWC back in February as well, on the 5G side which is both at the modem and back through the base station. And that, we believe, is really the differential that we're able to provide in the communication space is in a space like 5G where the modem and the base station and backhaul is so integrated and so important, we're able to provide that end-to-end solution.
From a foundry perspective, we continue to talk to several large customers and as we're able to, we'll talk about volumes and launching of new products. But for right now we're just saying we're continuing to invest and grow that business.
Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp.
Yeah, and the only thing that I would add is the strong CCG revenue growth of 6% in the quarter. As you'll remember, because our first launch client really didn't ramp until the second half of last year, the first half revenue growth for CCG will, particularly because the modem will have a relatively easy comp. So that's a contributor to growth in the first half, and as Brian said, the comps get much tougher in the second half because our one client launched in the second half last year, but given the product we have, we feel relatively good about where we are.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein. Your line is open.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I wanted to ask again about this 30% spending target. You guys just had an Analyst Day like two months ago. It seems like something that probably should have been talked about then. So what's changed in the last two months that means you need to roll the target out on today's call? And how should I try to reconcile that target with some of your other commentary at the Analyst Day where you were fairly gung ho about the need to invest to find growth?
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
So I'll start, Stacy. I think you have to take a look at where we're at. You're kind of asking a couple of questions. So first, from the growth standpoint, our position about investing and continuing to really drive growth is absolutely still just as strong as it was back in February at the Analyst Day. And I'd tell you Q1 is a great example of that, with year over year growth, another record quarter, coming off a record year and raising the year and forecasting another record year. So I feel very good about the investments we've made, both short term, medium term and long term to drive that growth.
That said, Bob and I have both been looking at, now how do we do that and also at the same time become more and more efficient. And what we've looked at now is that our performance and becoming more efficient in 2016 and taking about 1% out of our spending as a percent of revenue was very successful. We understand how we did that. As we looked at our first quarter performance and what we believe we can take out for the rest of 2017 is another percent of spending as a percent of revenue, slightly more actually.
And then I think one of the things that Bob's really brought in as the CFO is new ways of thinking and new looks at how to continue that trend. And so taking a percent a year or so out of our spending as a percent of revenue is something we think we can go and accomplish while driving that growth. And that is effort that we've spent over the last couple months, really digging into those details. And that's why we felt like it was important we came out now and really said, yes, we are committing to that. We understand the details behind it and we've got a history now that tells us we can say it with confidence.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Got it. For my follow up, I'd like to ask about DCG margins. So they were 35% this quarter. It doesn't sound like there was anything structural like the warranty charge that hit last quarter. This sounds like the drivers around allocation and everything else that you've discussed. But it's still quite a bit lower than I think most would have expected. How should we think about that margin profile trending through the year as the Skylake parts ramp? And do you think for the full year, you'll actually be within the Data Center margin targets that you provided at the Analyst Day?
Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp.
Yes, I would, Stacy, we kind of provided a long-term outlook of 40% to 45% operating margin for DCG.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Long term.
Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp.
Our expectations for this year were for growth, as Brian indicated earlier, high single digit and at the lower end of that range of the 40% to 45%. In the first quarter, just to be clear, the 9 point drop in margins, 7 points of that is attributed to the fact that DCG is a bigger business, and we've indicated it'll be the first on 7-nanometer and a fast follow on 10-nanometer. As a result, it gets a bigger share of our technology development and our SG&A allocation. So 7 points of the 9% decline are simply a result of how we allocate cost to the business segments.
I think in terms of going through the course of the year, the things that are going to change, as Brian indicated, we got strong product offering coming out in the second half of the year. We expect ASPs to improve as we go throughout the year. As you know, the first quarter is always the lower end of margins from a seasonal perspective. And we expect product costs to improve as we continue the transition from 22 to 14 nanometer.
So it's in line with our long-term expectations. No change. Our outlook for 2017, no change. The biggest fundamental driver to margin performance is simply the success of the Data Center business in terms of growing, in terms of being a bigger chunk of the overall business, in terms of being a beneficiary of leading-edge technology. It bears 7 points impact because of the higher burden of our allocations on the business. So we feel good on where we are for the quarter and where we're positioned for the full year.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
But those allocation charges aren't going to go away anytime soon. It sounds like they're going to hang around for a while, if you're talking about 10 and then 7 nanometer.
Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp.
Yeah, that's true, and that's reflected in our 40% to 45% and our improvement throughout the course of the year.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Okay. Thank you, guys.
Mark H. Henninger - Intel Corp.
Thanks, Stacy.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Bob, maybe just to follow on to Stacy's question, just some clarification around the allocation charges. The 7 points in March, does that represent a peak? Or do we run into a situation where as absolute costs for 7 and 10 go up throughout the year, you could see op margins in DCG continue to be down just because the percent doesn't change but the dollars are going up?
Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp.
Yeah, our expectation is the operating margins for DCG will improve by quarter throughout the year. Again, it will be a function of the normal seasonality of the profitability of the business. It will still bear a significant chunk of our tech development and SG&A costs, but you may remember that our development costs during the course of the year, as we indicated I think maybe last couple quarters, that comes down from first half to second half. So as that cost comes down, all of our businesses will benefit from lower costs.
And then the third thing, the real fundamentals of the business are higher ASPs with good product with outstanding performance and getting better and better yields on our 14-nanometer product going through the fab will be benefits to the profitability of the business. The lowest point Q1 expectations will grow each quarter throughout the year, and we would expect full-year operating margins despite higher absorption, higher burden from our indirect costs at roughly 40% for the year.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
That clarification's helpful. And then, Brian, as my follow-up, one of the strengths of your model is just the free cash flow that you can generate, which enables you to reinvest organically back in the business. And you're clearly doing it this year on the CapEx front with CapEx up over 20% year over year. I guess what I'm trying to understand is, should we be thinking of CapEx this year as sort of the new norm with rising capital intensity, investments in the Memory business, maybe optionality around foundry? Or is the $12 billion this year sort of something that we should think about as being an above trend or particularly high spending year? Any color on that would be helpful.
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
Sure, John. I'd tell you that the increase in CapEx that you're seeing this year is something that we see as unique, but my guess is that we'll have to continue it for maybe one year more or so as we continue to build out that memory factory. But if you take a long-term view, I don't expect us to run these kinds of CapEx levels. We'll always make good investments, so in a place like this where we think we have differential technology like 3D NAND and our Optane/3D XPoint, I'm going to look for ways to invest that have a positive NPV. But from this current view, we probably have another year, and then probably go back down to what we'd consider a more normal rate.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Thanks. Very helpful.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from David Wong from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thanks very much. Can you give us some idea within Data Center of what revenues you're currently seeing from Xeon Phi? And also you mentioned acceleration services at Alibaba. Can you fill us in on any other key customers adopting Xeon Phi, FPGAs or any of your other accelerators?
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
Sure. So we don't break out revenue on specific products like Phi, but Xeon Phi does continue to ramp and grow from a product standpoint. We have some additional products that will launch in the second half of this year around Xeon Phi from Knights Mill. And from an FPGA or other accelerators, we continue to get several of the large cloud providers, networking providers who are continuing to use our FPGAs.
But again, we don't break out on a by-customer standpoint, but we still are committed to our 6% roughly growth on the PSG business this year. Q1 was down just because of some unique – there was some extra buying in the latter half of last year around some cloud, and the networking guys are typically down in the first quarter. So it hit its forecast, but it's down year over year. We think we'll recover that as we go through the rest of the year from an FPGA.
And then as we go out through the second half of this year, the first of the products comes out in silicon from our Nervana acquisition which is another form of AI acceleration. We'll get that first silicon. We'll start to work with customers and you'll see that come in 2018 as an additional accelerator adding to our full AI portfolio.
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Great. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri from Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC
Thank you. I just wanted to clarify your answer to John's question. So in terms of the $300 million year over year burden on DCG operating margin that's due to the cost allocation, is that sort of a fixed number going forward? Or does that absolute number get better through the year?
Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp.
There's two dynamics on our total pool of indirect costs that are going on for the company. One is our SG&A indirect costs are coming down. Brian referred to that earlier about the progress we've made on direct spending overall coming down another 1 point plus during the course of the year. And second, our R&D cost particularly as it relates to Moore's Law for 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer goes up little bit. So during the course of the year, our overall cost will be roughly flat that we'll be allocating to the businesses. And DCG will get a larger portion of that than it has historically, roughly impacting the business by 7 points because of its bigger size and because of the decision to have it be a beneficiary of Moore's Law sooner than it has historically.
Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC
Thank you. And then as a follow-up, so I just wanted to clarify, so the NSG, so you're expecting to still lose money into the first half of next year and is that what you're saying? Or you're saying that for the entirety of the year next year you'll be profitable. Thanks.
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
So separate out again and remember we're making the large investments in Dalian, so from a pure 3D NAND perspective, we said it goes breakeven and beyond in the latter half of this year. So for next year, our standard NAND business will be profitable. 3D XPoint plus the Optane product is additional investments we're making. We said that that's in the second half of next year it goes to breakeven and the overall business does as well. We haven't gotten any more granular than that for right now.
Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC
Thank you very much
Mark H. Henninger - Intel Corp.
Operator, we have time for two more questions.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question will come from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Wanted to ask the first one on the OpEx side of things, and I applaud the 30% target. It's good to see that commitment, but I wanted to focus a little bit more on the near term. In the first quarter it was about $100 million above what you had guided and the second quarter is a bit above what I expected too, especially given McAfee. So could you give us a little color on why it was a little bit higher in the first quarter? And where we are in the restructuring benefits and the McAfee benefits, if you can do anything to size either of those in the near term, that would be helpful.
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
Yes, I think first quarter, a little bit over. I'd characterize it primarily in the round. I think for first half, we're basically implying $10.6 billion of OpEx and we're committed to our $20.5 billion for the full year. So $10.6 billion in first half drops to $9.9 billion in the second half and there's really two primary drivers to that. One is, as you alluded, the exit of McAfee will be roughly $300 million out from the first half run rate. And then secondly, just the completion of our previously announced restructuring programs will continue to bear fruit on lower OpEx in the second half of the year. So first half $10.6 billion, second half, $9.9 billion. McAfee exit, continued execution, and feel good about full year $20.5 billion.
Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp.
And just a reminder, that $20.5 billion takes another roughly 1%, slightly more, out of our spending as a percent of revenue. So that's all baked in.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. Thanks for that detail. I guess my follow-up then switches to the gross margin side of things. It's staying solid, and I might be at the risk of a rounding error in this question as well. But considering that you raised your revenues and ASPs were a big portion of that, usually that's a pretty good follow through. So the fact that you're keeping the gross margin guide for the year flat at 63%, are there any incremental offsets to the goodness that the revenue and the ASPs would generate? Or is it, in fact, just rounding?
Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp.
I don't know if it's rounding or not. I'd say $0.5 billion of revenue upside at kind of roughly gross margin dynamics of the business will fall through at an additional $0.05 of EPS, so we feel great about that. I think the dynamics of more the business is in the second half. ASPs will improve for Data Center. As Brian alluded earlier, we've assumed that ASPs will decline a little for the Client business. And the fast growth of Memory and modem will have a negative mix impact on gross margins. So I think when we take that altogether through the year, we felt a fairly consistent 63% with all those puts and takes throughout to the course of the year. And Q1 was where we expected, Q2 consistent with Q1 and full year.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thank you.
Mark H. Henninger - Intel Corp.
Thanks, Ross. Operator, can you please go ahead and introduce our last question?
Operator
Thank you. And our final question comes from Kevin Cassidy from Stifel. Your line is open.
Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Thank you for taking my question. Just on the capacity that you're building in Dalian, can you say what percentage increase you're getting? Or is it directly correlated to the revenue growth that you see in the Memory Group?
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
Percentage. So, A, yes. The growth in the Memory business that goes through the rest of this year is largely driven by the ramp of the Dalian factory, along with some assumptions around strong ASPs as demand continues to outpace supply in the market in general. And so if you take a look from here on, in fact 2017, but then as we go out into 2018 beyond, Dalian will continue to be the driver of growth of that business.
Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
I guess another way to phrase the question is, what's the bit growth? Most other memory companies give a projection of what their bit growth is.
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
Yes. I don't think we've actually ever given a bit growth, so that's not a public number. We can take a look at that for next quarter as to whether we want to start adding that to our normal distribution. But what we've always talked about is growth of the business from a profit or revenue standpoint and overall growth.
Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay. Thank you.
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
Partly because remember, more and more of that business will become things like 3D XPoint slash Optane. And bits will be a little bit different there, right, not all bits are going to be created equal. That's a very differentiating technology. It's really got performance of DRAM-like devices with NAND non-volatility and pricing in between. And so those bits are a bit different than, say, typical NAND bits, and I wouldn't want to just lump those all into a standard number. So we need to think about how we'd really go and present this to you if you want to think about it from a bit standpoint. And that, it's around 5% of the business this year. But as you go out into next year and beyond, it becomes a larger and larger percentage as we see more and more products, especially in the data centers, use the Optane technology.
Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Right. And maybe if I could ask that question too of Optane. When would it transfer to China?
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
We haven't talked about a transfer date to China yet.
Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay.
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
So that hasn't been made public right now. Right now, Dalian is 3D NAND.
Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay. Great. Thank you.
Mark H. Henninger - Intel Corp.

Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Intel Corporation Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I'd now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Mark Henninger, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Mark H. Henninger - Intel Corp.
Thank you, Chanel, and welcome everyone to Intel's Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. By now you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with it. If you've not received both documents, they're available on our Investor website, intc.com.
I'm joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO; and Bob Swan, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them, followed by Q&A.
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.
A brief reminder that this quarter, we have provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we will be speaking to non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The CFO commentary and earnings release available on intc.com include the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations.
And finally, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be hosting our annual Investor Meeting here at our Santa Clara headquarters on Thursday, February 9. If you have any questions about the event or logistics, please contact Investor Relations.
With that, let me hand it over to Brian.
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
Thanks, Mark. I'd like to cover three things with you today before handing off to Bob: a brief review of our results for the year; an update on the transformation of the company; and a look ahead at 2017 and Intel's future.
First, the review of our result. Q4 was a strong finish to a record year in which we increased revenue 7% and net income 9%. The Client Computing Group, Data Center Group, Internet of Things and Intel Security all grew in 2016, with DCG and IoTG setting full-year revenue and volume records. The acquisition of Altera added three percentage points to our overall growth rate.
In the Data Center, cloud service provider revenue grew 24%, while enterprise revenue was down 3% for the full-year. Additionally, we are very excited that comm service provider revenue grew 19%, and across all of our customer categories, adjacency revenue grew an incredible 21% with strength in Ethernet controllers, Omni-Path fabric controllers and switches and network ASICs.
IoT revenue was up 15% for the full-year, driven by strength in the video, retail and industrial segment. In Q4, we launched new Apollo Lake and Kaby Lake product and we won key designs in automotive and video.
Our Memory business finished the year with record quarterly revenue, while full-year revenue was down 1%. This was an investment year for the Memory business, but MSG operating margins improved meaningfully in the fourth quarter. We are now shipping 3D NAND from our Fab 68 and we just qualified our first 3D XPoint base Optane SSDs, which we expect to ship for revenue in the first quarter. And our 3D XPoint memory DIMM, a sample to data center customers.
The Client Computing business achieved impressive result, driven by strong execution and higher ASPs as customers bought a richer mix of Intel Core products. This was also a breakout year for CCG's wireless communication product line, our 7360 LTE modem ramped into high volume and we shipped record Wi-Fi units. I'm very proud of the Client Computing business and what this team has delivered in 2016.
Our strategy of delivering consistent product leadership, segmentation and differentiation paid off. We achieved record i7 units and overall core mix in 2016. And Client Computing revenue was up 2% for the year, despite a declining PC market.
The Programmable Solutions Group was up about 7% on a non-GAAP basis over Altera's 2015 results. PSG saw strength across many segments with particular strength in compute and storage. The Programmable Solutions business tackled the industry's first and only 14-nanometer FPGA this year, known as Stratix 10. This product line has the largest demand pipeline in Altera's history.
The integration of Altera into Intel was an important milestone in what was a transformative year for Intel. This team did a great job of meeting integration objectives, while continuing to deliver new products and grow the business.
In 2016, we took other important and in some cases difficult steps to position the company for future success, improve the alignment of our resources to our strategy and accelerate our transformation to the company that powers the cloud and billions of smart connected devices.
Our restructuring initiative focused on our investments on the product and technologies that will fuel our growth, and that work, combined with improvements in 14-nanometer cost, drove a 30% operating margin improvement in our Client business.
Our decision to establish McAfee as a separate, independent company was another transformative move. This transaction will give McAfee the flexibility to invest independently, tighten our focus and allow Intel to share in McAfee's future success as the market demand for world-class security product continues to grow.
And finally, looking ahead to 2017, and Intel's future, I'm confident we're making the right investments to compete and win, not only in the segments where Intel is strong today, but also in new areas that are poised for growth driven by the emerging flood of data.
By 2020, the average person will generate about 1.5 GB of data per day, while smart and connected devices of the future will produce data at many times that rate. Autonomous cars, for example, will generate about 4,000 GB of data each day. The resulting explosion of data is creating tremendous opportunity. But data alone isn't valuable. It's the transmission, aggregation and analysis of the data that results in value and impact. Intel will play essential role in those steps because our products are key to turning raw data into high-value insight and information.
Our investments in advanced research and development are making this all possible, while significantly expanding our TAM at the same time. These investments are creating opportunities in segments from autonomous driving, where we are uniquely positioned to be the compute engine in the vehicle and the data center, to 5G where we are building on our momentum in 4G to establish leadership, to artificial intelligence where we are providing the industry's most complete range of products to accelerate all AI solutions from the edge to the data center.
We're already seeing signs of progress. In autonomous driving, we are winning key designs like BMW, Delphi and WiDi. In 5G, we are leading in the definition of standards, prototyping and field trials.
Our network business saw strong growth as infrastructure moved to Intel architecture in anticipation of 5G. Our design wins and network virtualization, innovation position us for leadership share in the wireless access market.
Other proof points of our progress include important partnerships with AT&T, SK Telecom, Korea Telecom and Verizon and the announcement earlier this month of the industry's first global 5G modem.
Finally, in Artificial Intelligence, we believe we have the industry's strongest product portfolio. Intel processors power well over 90% of servers deployed to support machine learning workload, and we are winning the vast majority of AI solution based on strong product performance and customer value.
Wrapping things up, I'm very pleased with Intel's performance in 2016. We have important work to do in 2017 as we continue to transform the company, but the progress we've made leaves me increasingly confident in Intel's growth and Intel's future.
And with that, I'll hand it over to Bob.
Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
Thanks, Brian. The fourth quarter was an outstanding quarter. Revenue was up 10%, operating income was up 11%, and EPS was up 4% year-over-year. Revenue set an all-time record of $16.4 billion, and operating income was $4.9 billion.
Fourth quarter operating margin was 30%, flat year-over-year. Gross margin at 63% was down two points, primarily driven by a couple of one-time events related to product warranty cost and long-term IP agreements.
Direct spending came in at $5.4 billion, up 4% year-over-year and down two points as a percent of revenue. Earnings per share of $0.79 was up $0.03 from a year-ago.
The Client Computing Group had revenue of $9.1 billion, up 4% year-over-year. During the fourth quarter, the worldwide PC supply chain remained healthy, and we saw some inventory burn during the quarter. Client ASPs were up 7% year-over-year, and core mix was at an all-time high, as a result of the success of our segmentation strategies and strength in gaming and high-end systems.
This segment had another quarter of significant profit growth, with operating profit growing 30% from a year ago as the business continues to benefit from lower spending, richer product mix and continued improvements in 14-nanometer unit cost.
The Data Center Group had record revenue of $4.7 billion, up 8% year-over-year. In the fourth quarter, we continued to see robust growth in the cloud and comm service provider segments of the business, which both grew approximately 30% year-over-year, partially offset by a 7% decline in the enterprise and government segment over the same horizon.
The Data Center Group had operating profit of $1.9 billion, down 14% year-over-year. Operating margin was impacted by the two one-time items I referred to earlier and the ramp of 14-nanometer on our server products, which we expect to generate continued cost improvements over time.
Our Internet of Things business achieved record revenue of $726 million, growing 16% year-over-year, driven by strength in both the retail and industrial segment. Operating profit for the business was $182 million, up 37% year-over-year.
Our Memory business had record revenue of $816 million, up 25% year-over-year with strong demand for data center SSD solutions with demand signals outpacing supply. We've made great progress ramping Fab 68 with yields and unit costs well ahead of expectation. This segment had an operating loss of $91 million, largely driven by cost associated with 3D XPoint and startup costs for our memory capacity.
The Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $420 million, and operating profit was $80 million. Our Intel Security Group business had revenue of $550 million and operating profit of $103 million.
Turning to the full-year 2016, revenue grew 7%, operating margin grew 11% and EPS grew 9%. Operating margin percent improved by one point, while gross margin was approximately 63%, flat to 2015.
Spending was $21 billion, or 35.4% of revenue, down one point from 2015, primarily from the restructuring programs we began earlier in the year. Operating profit for the year was $16.5 billion. Earnings per share for the year was $2.72, up $0.23 from the prior year.
In 2016, the business generated record cash from operations of $21.8 billion. We purchased $9.6 billion in capital assets, paid $4.9 billion in dividends and repurchased about $2.6 billion of stock. Total cash balance was $17.1 billion, down $8.2 billion. Total debt was $25.3 billion. Our net cash balance, total cash less debt and inclusive of our other longer-term investments is approximately negative $2.3 billion.
Now, let me turn to guidance. First, some context. First, our guidance assumes a stable macroeconomic environment, but we have taken a more cautious view of PC consumption versus third parties, particularly in our outlook for the emerging markets including Russia, China and Latin America.
Second for the Data Center, we continue to expect similar growth rates in the cloud and comm segment, but we are not expecting an improvement in enterprise. This gets us to an expectation of high single-digit growth in the Data Center business. Third as a reminder, we have one less week as a result of the inclusion of an extra work week in 2016. And last, we have assumed the Intel Security transaction will close in Q2 and our full-year guidance reflects one full quarter of the group's consolidated results.
We have lots of work to do to close this out, and in the event the close happens at the end of the second quarter, we would update our full-year guidance by approximately an additional $500 million of revenue and $100 million of operating income.
As we look forward to the first quarter of 2017, we are forecasting a midpoint of the revenue range at $14.8 billion, up 7% year-over-year and down from the fourth quarter. This is at the lower end of our seasonal range and reflects an expectation of lower core brand mix and ASP coming off a strong holiday selling period for gaming and other premium PC systems.
For the first quarter, we expect operating margin percent to increase four points year-over-year, gross margins to be flat at approximately 63% and spending to be $5.3 billion, down 1%. We expect EPS to be approximately $0.65, up 20% year-over-year.
Turning to the full-year 2017, we're expecting revenue to be roughly flat. Revenue is expected to grow in the low single digits, after excluding the Intel Security Group from both years. We expect operating margin percent to be up one point year-over-year with flat gross margins and direct spending as a percent of revenue down one point versus 2016.
Let me provide a bit more detail on our year-over-year direct spending. Our restructuring plans are on track, including reducing our head count by approximately 15,000 heads and generating gross savings of $1.6 billion. We are reallocating investments from CCG to higher growth segments and are continuing to invest in areas that extend our leadership position in Moore's Law and expand TAM opportunities such as memory and autonomous driving.
We anticipate the net benefit of these actions to result in an additional point of improvement in direct spending as a percent of revenue in 2017. We expect EPS of approximately $2.80, up 3% year-over-year.
In 2016, we had a fairly significant gain from our Icap portfolio. Our 2017 guidance assumes that we'll have gains roughly in line with 2016 levels. The capital spending forecast for 2017 is $12 billion, up $2.5 billion from 2016 as we continue to ramp our memory capacity.
In closing, 2016 started out slow but finished strong. Our CCG business is focused and executing extremely well in a declining market and provides scale that's required to advance Moore's Law, generate significant cash flows and enables investments for growth. Our growth-oriented businesses were up 15% collectively as we continue to transform the company from PC-centric company to a company of smart and connected devices that power the cloud.
We are excited about our plans for 2017 as we continue with our transformation, and we look forward to sharing more details with you at our Investor Day in February.
With that, let me turn it over back to Mark.
Mark H. Henninger - Intel Corp.
Okay. Thank you, Brian and Bob. Moving on now to the Q&A, as is our normal practice we would ask each participant to ask one question and just one follow-up if you have one. Chanel, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Our first question comes from the line of Chris Danely of Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Hey. Thanks, guys. Just digging in on the segments, the CCG operating margins were I think the highest in the last few years. DCG was kind of the lowest in the last few years. Can you just talk about the trend in operating margins for those two segments for this year given the guidance?
Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
Yeah, Chris. The CCG performance – a couple of dynamics that are driving the record margins. One, higher ASPs on the strong mix that Brian referred to. Secondly, real strong unit cost. It's been on 14-nanometer for a while, so we expect that to continue. And then constrained investments in the CCG business as we focus more on investing heavier in the higher growth businesses. So real good performance, and those are the dynamics that we're expecting in 2017.
On the DCG front, good in Q4 and then project forward. Nice ASP performance in the quarter as we migrate from Haswell to Broadwell, and as we think about Skylake in 2017, we expect that to continue. Unit cost in DCG is a little bit higher because we're coming off more great unit cost performance on 22-nanometer, but as we migrate to 14-nanometer in the earlier stages of that cycle, unit costs are little bit higher. And then we're increasing our investments in DCG on a year-over-year basis.
So, dynamics are relatively good. The one – I referred to it a little bit earlier, but in terms of Q4, we had a couple one-time items that really weighed on the profitability or operating margins of DCG that we think are well-bounded and do not expect to continue in 2017. And just quickly, one, we entered into a long-term cross licensed agreement and patent purchase agreement, particularly in the comm space in the quarter, and DCG was impacted by a portion of that cost in the quarter.
But secondly, and a little bit more significant, we were observing a product quality issue in the fourth quarter with slightly higher expected failure rates under certain use and time constraints, and we established a reserve to deal with that. We think we have it relatively well-bounded with a minor design fix that we're working with our clients to resolve. So, those two one-timers in the fourth quarter weighed on DCG margins, and we do not expect that to continue in 2017.
Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Great. Thanks. Do I get a follow-up?
Mark H. Henninger - Intel Corp.
Yeah. Please go ahead, Chris.
Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Oh. Great. Maybe just to expand on the PC market, what do you see driving the strength here? How sustainable is it? Any thoughts on PC unit growth for this year?
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
This is Brian. I can start, and then Bob can add in. If you take a look – Bob mentioned in his portion of the talk of, hey, we've taken a slightly more conservative view of 2017 then third parties for what we see the overall PC unit market as, and we had extremely strong, record Core i7, record core mix in the fourth quarter that we've, as we look at Q1 and we look at 2017, we factored a little bit of caution into that as well. Those two things put us in the PC market in the unit level in the mid-single-digit decline. That's better than if you went back a year or so ago, we were in the high single-digits, depending on how you looked at it and where you counted from the 2-in-1 devices. So, it is starting to get better, but I don't think we're back at a zero unit or a positive unit.
But as Bob said, what we've really been focusing on in that space is how do you make money, how do you sell up, how do you do a better business performance in that kind of market? And we're comfortable that we can continue that into 2017.

And Chris, the only thing I'd add is we think, as Brian said, our outlook is a little more conservative than the third parties and our view is that's probably the right posture and the right caution to have as we go into the year. And obviously, the team has done a great job in adjusting its cost structure for a more cautious outlook, and then we'll see how it plays out during the course of the year.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Joe L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you. I wonder if I could ask about the DCG commentary of being up by single-digits. Obviously that's a little bit more conservative than the longer-term numbers you had talked about. And I guess as you think about that, is there an element of the cloud spending that you think is causing the enterprise to be weaker? Or maybe just give us the qualitative underpinnings for that change?
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
Sure. So let me start, and then again Bob can jump in on this one. As we said, we took a look at the 2017 view on enterprise to be relatively equivalent to what we saw in 2016, which says that enterprise continues to decline.
I think that certainly some of that is, that it's moving to the public cloud, it's moving to those areas at a faster rate than I think we expected. It's also been a little bit slow about developing private cloud and we're working with several partners like Microsoft, Azure and others around the private cloud segments as well for the enterprise. But if you take a look at the long-term, we still see this as the growth engine and still getting into that double-digit regime.
Remember, for us, enterprise is now less than 50% of our overall Data Center business and the areas that are growing even faster or as fast as cloud in most cases are the networking and storage space, which we have very low market share in still, and it's a great opportunity for us. And then the emerging areas like Silicon Photonics, Omni-Path fabric, Rack Scale Design and 3D XPoint, and those areas are really what we've always forecasted to be the growth engine of the Data Center Group as we exit and go towards the back half of this decade.
So for us, our view is this is, anytime you're going to a market transition, you're not going to get the cloud to enterprise mixed perfect, and this is an anomaly right now that we've forecasted, we think, accurately and adjusted for the way it is. But our long-term growth was actually based on other factors and we're still very, very confident in those growth areas. I don't know if Bob wants to add?
Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
Nope, I think that's perfect. Nothing to add. Thanks.
Joe L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you for that. That's great. And then separately on the PC market, the ASP growth that you guys saw over the course of 2016, is that strictly mix shift and strength in the higher-end segments as you've been talking about? And any thoughts on your ability to continue that price momentum over the course of this year?
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
Sure, yeah, it mostly, if not in almost every case, all mix shift and our customers buying up. And the great example was the case SKUs, the enthusiast, the 10-core systems that we put out there, and they far and away exceeded our original sales forecast for people who are out there buying 10-core gaming systems.
So we do believe that that market, that enthusiast market will continue. We factored a little bit more caution into this as we go into the 2017 in the first quarter. Some of that is seasonality. Holiday, people tend to buy lot of gaming systems, and some of it's just how much more can people buy up? And so how much more growth in ASP can we see? But we don't see a decline or anything of the average ASPs.
Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
The only thing I would add as we think about the full-year, the second half comps get a little bit tougher on ASPs, because of the strong ASP performance throughout the course of the 2016. So, that's probably the only other dynamic that I would add.
Joe L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you very much.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hey, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I guess the first one on OpEx, and it's more of a conceptual one for you, Brian. On flat revenues it's great to see some OpEx leverage on there, but I think some people are hoping for a little bit more as you had the restructuring only halfway done and then the McAfee sale that's pending. So, can you talk conceptually how you balance the desire to reinvest versus the desire to get the profitability up to your long-term targets?
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
Sure. I'll let Bob talk about the McAfee financials and how that affects OpEx, because it's a little complex with Q1 into Q1 target there. But let's just talk about it in general. What we've always said is that we were going to go through the program that we went through at the middle of last year, which we called ACT, which was continued through the end of last year 2016, and we said we'd be completed about the middle of 2017. And we always said there'd be some mix between taking that to the bottom line and reinvesting it in those growth areas.
And so, as we've done acquisitions like Nervana for Artificial Intelligence, we want to invest in those businesses now to bring them onto our Silicon to integrate them into our software stack, and so we're going to make those kinds of investments in key areas. We said the key areas are around Data Center in general. We have Rack Scale Design. We have 3D XPoint. We have Artificial Intelligence around IoT, and we're making big bets around autonomous driving.
And so you see us making the investment in HERE, the investments with BMW, and that's really – when you take a look at autonomous driving and why are we doing that, it's around data and data centers again. Remember, every one of those high definition maps is going to require data centers. They're going to require small data centers at the edge.
So it's all around are we understanding and managing how data is going to flow in that system? And then Memory itself, and we're going to go make those investments around 3D XPoint and really bringing that and 3D NAND to market in a big way. And so we'll balance between those, and I think you'll see some mix of bringing it to the bottom line. But if I can invest, and think I can turn that into additional profitability in the future, I'm going to go and do that.
Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
Yeah. The only thing I'd add is just to maybe make it a little simple for people is we look at our full-year guidance that we gave, and then we extract out three quarters of McAfee. At the macro level, we're looking at low single-digit growth and mid single-digit EPS growth, so that's kind of the year-on-year apples-to-apples dynamic. On direct spending itself, we'll be down roughly half – our guidance implies we'll be down roughly $500 million year-on-year, and that's just a function of three things.
One, continued benefits from the restructuring actions that we took in 2016 and continue to execute on in the first half of 2017. Secondly, obviously the direct spend of McAfee kind of goes away. And third, as Brian mentioned, during this transformation we continue to make the investments in the higher growth businesses. We'll continue to invest in 5G and ADAS, and then we'll continue to invest in Moore's Law as we bring 10-nanometer to life in 2017 and continue to invest in 7-nanometer. So net-net, the implications of all that for direct spending was one point down as a percentage of revenue in 2016 and another point down as a percentage of revenue in 2017.
And then the only other thing I would add is in terms of the milestones that we employ during the course of the year for these big bets, we'll continue to build milestones then to make sure those bets that we're making are turning out in the medium and long term the way we expect.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
That's very helpful. I guess as my follow-up, you talked about the ASPs in answering a prior question. I wondered about the competitive intensity in the PC market. You're taking a more conservative tack than the third-party vendors are forecasting, but your primary x86 competitor is coming out with a new architecture for the first time in many, many years. So, I wonder whether it's on the ASP or the unit or the market share side how you're factoring that into your forecast for the year.
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
Sure. I would tell you that we always look at this environment and say there's going to be a competitive risk in the environment. And we're always focused on really, our own product roadmap and making sure that we have the highest performance product. So, when we look at 2017, we still believe that our product roadmap is truly the best ever it's been.
And as we look at the Kaby Lake and as it really ramps up through 2017, or it came out really just at the end of 2016 and now will ramp with many more SKUs and higher-performance products as we go into 2017. And then we showed at CES the first working 10-nanometer Cannonlake product, which we're still planning to ship by the end of this year and really ramp into 2018. We still believe that our roadmap and our leadership will continue to give us the performance the customers want and desire. And so that didn't necessarily factor into that more cautious forecast. That forecast was really much more a function of where we think the PC market really is overall.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I had a question first on the guidance for next year. Unless I'm doing the math wrong to get to $2.80, I need a fairly sizable reduction in share count. So is that true? Could you tell us how you're thinking about shares for next year? Are you intending to use the cash from McAfee to buy back shares to get to that number?
Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
First, in essence, the guidance year-on-year doesn't really anticipate any dramatic change in our share count. I think philosophically, our approach is to offset dilution from our comp-based program. So all else equal, share count relatively flat year-on-year. I think the one thing worth noting is we, in our Icap portfolio in 2016, we had a fairly significant gain. And what I indicated in the prepared remarks is we expect roughly in 2017 that gain to be in line with what 2016 generated.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Okay.
Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
But I think just in terms of implied share count in our guidance, it's essentially flat year-on-year.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Okay. For my follow-up, I wanted to again dig into the OpEx. So you talked about like a mix of the restructure and the cuts versus the reinvestment. But I mean if I throw the McAfee cost back in, you've actually got OpEx going up fairly sizably year-over-year. And your employee count is actually up year-over-year, even though you supposedly had a pretty big, a layoff. So I guess can you talk a little more specifically about exactly what the additional spending is going on? Is it people versus technology versus something else? Where is it going? And do you view those investments as looking to open up new markets versus being defensive in nature, or maybe a mix of both?
Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
Yeah. In terms of the type of cost, maybe two-fold. Yes, people and yes, technology slash Moore's Law at the macro level, and that expresses itself in higher depreciation year-on-year. So in our guide, our depreciation is up quite a bit and a portion of that will flow through direct spending.
Again on a more macro basis, at the risk of maybe repeating myself, we are investing more in DCG and in particular, bringing some of these adjacent products that Brian referred to, to market. We continue to invest in Memory, in particularly the 3D XPoint product, and we continue to invest in IoT. So those three businesses are getting a disproportionate share of the investment, because those are the businesses that we've seen really strong growth in 2016 and we're counting on continued growth in 2017.
The second area, and again, we talked about this a little bit, but we see real opportunities in autonomous driving that play to our strengths and our capabilities. And we are making step function increase in our investments to position ourselves very well for that industry in that market as it evolves.
And then again third, 7-nanometer technology investment in the spend associated with building a new pilot line in 2017 is also an additional investment. So, we're executing on our restructuring programs, it was – we took out roughly, we made the tough decisions in 2016 that resulted in roughly 11,000 fewer people as a result of our restructuring program. We're not quite done, but I'd say we're on track. At the same time, we're making investments both in technology and people to strengthen and enhance our competitive position in the areas that we see as real opportunities for us.
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
The only thing I would add, Stacy, is more of a blunt answer to your question is, if you take a look at the areas that we're talking about, in almost every case these are new and expanding TAMs for us.
So even when you look at the places where we're going in the Data Center, and this was my point earlier about enterprise versus cloud. Enterprise is now less than 50% of our total makeup for the Data Center Group, and the cloud is growing great and that will continue, but if you look at the areas, the majority of the rest of the growth for the rest of this decade in the Data Center alone, it's networking and storage where we have very low market share today. But we're bringing things like software-defined networking and NFV to those and so that's a growing and expanding TAM as those markets move to Intel architecture.
And then it's going into Rack Scale Design, Omni-Path fabric, Silicon Photonics, those are all again new either nascent or expanding TAMs for us. Autonomous cars and the IoT space are new and expanding TAMs for us. 5G is a TAM that's brand new that will be really being built out over the rest of this decade.
And then Memory, if you look at the large part of the investment we're making is 3D XPoint, which we will really re-architect memory and storage and we'll create a new market in our mind and we believe we are unique in having that technology.
So to me when I look at the investment, they're all focused around data, they're all in support of how the data center ecosystem works and they're all in either expanding or new TAM or Intel. And so that's why I see the growth in those areas. It's not just enhancing the technologies that we already have. We'll do that, but the new investments are really focused on the new areas.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Brian, my first question, I want to go back to the DCG ASPs in the December quarter. They were up 4% year-over-year, which kind of reverses I think the four quarter or five quarter trend of ASPs going down.
I know that you've had some mixed headwinds that have been driving blended ASPs down, I'm kind of curious what happened in the fourth quarter to drive ASPs up? And do you think it's sustainable, is this just what we would expect to see the first quarter of the Broadwell launch and then it normalizes going forward? How do you think about ASP's from here?
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
John, I'll let Bob start with this and then I'll come in and talk a little bit about the macro view of it.
Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
Yeah. Two dynamics in the fourth quarter where we had higher ASPs. One, the continued transition from Haswell to Broadwell, is helpful, and then as we project forward, the next transition is Skylake, we believe will be helpful as well. So those dynamics where we're delivering better performance for our customers, we're able to capture some of that in ASPs, and we saw a little bit of that in the fourth quarter.
And secondly, in the comms and network space, which is a share gain opportunity for us in DSG, getting those clients to move up the stack in terms of the high performance server CPUs is the second dynamic, both of which we think are helpful as we exit 2016 and go into 2017.
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
Yeah. And only thing I'd add, John, is, we'll – as we go back into the second half of this year do this Skylake transition, and that is a technology that will increase performance and the performance per cost to our customers in one of the largest improvements in a long time, if not ever, on the data center. So we expect – typically when that happens, people see the value in that, and they tend to buy up. They tend to buy the better SKUs. So to my view, this trend of higher mix should continue.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
That's helpful. And then maybe as my follow-up, Brian, relative to the full-year guide you're kind of expecting a pretty significant drop in free cash flow this year with the increase in CapEx, and you highlighted that CapEx is going to the Non-Volatile Memory Group. I'm just kind of curious, given that that business, even though it made some improvements in losses in the calendar fourth quarter, is still in sort of a loss position. I'm assuming the higher CapEx is going to be a headwind to getting to profitability, but I guess, how do you think about the path to profitability, the longer term business model in Memory and what it might do to the DCG growth rate longer term if XPoint is successful?
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
Sure. So let's talk about Memory in kind of a big picture, John, and then I'll let Bob talk a little bit about how the CapEx lays and what our view on CapEx is in the space.
But we are in this space for one reason because I understand it's a cyclical business that tends to be fairly difficult from a price capacity standpoint. But we believe we're coming at it with two very unique technologies. Our 3D NAND technology has some of the best performance and best cost in the market. Our current version of 3D NAND has a 15% cost value over the competition, and our next version, second generation, has even a higher when you look at it on a density basis.
And so we believe we're going to be able to bring differential cost and performance in 3D NAND that will give us a unique position, and that, combined with our knowledge of the data center, should allow us to really provide compelling product for data center SSDs. 3D XPoint is very different and that is a unique technology that bridges between memory and storage, and we believe it can re-architect how big data applications, artificial intelligence applications where you want large amounts of data being brought up as close to the compute as you can, will really transform not only the architecture of those systems but the performance of those systems.
And we've demonstrated on stage, even on client systems, using these types of SSDs on an equal price you can get 5x to 7x performance improvement using 3D XPoint as a large memory storage combination. So, we're investing purely because we believe we have this differential technology, and that's why we're in this business. I think if I didn't have that differential, not sure it's a business that Intel would necessarily be in, right? But with that leadership, and as we believe we can sustain that leadership, we believe it's a good business and a good investment. I'll let Bob talk about and how long and how we view the capital.
Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
John, the CapEx dynamic – first kind of at the macro level, up $2.5 billion year-on-year, driven by two things. One, Memory obviously, but also bringing 10-nanometer capacity online. If I just go down a level to Memory, roughly $1.6 billion CapEx in 2016. Expectation is that it'll be roughly $2.5 billion in 2017 as we bring the incremental capacity online. And as we look at Memory specifically in 2018, we think it begins to drop off a little bit as we focus that capacity on 3D NAND and increasingly 3D XPoint.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thanks for taking my question. Brian, I'm curious with this new U.S. administration. There's a lot of interest in using U.S.-made products. And since you have sizable fabs here in the U.S., I'm wondering how you can take advantage of this environment, or if you're interested in making a bigger push in your foundry business.
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
Well, we're always open for business in foundry and we're always interested. Remember, we said our foundry strategy was really to be on the leading edge, so – because we can get paid for our technology. And it really allows us to use our unique differentiation in that space.
Beyond that, I would just tell you we've always been proud. I mean it's not a new transition or new strategy for Intel. We've always been roughly between – a little bit more than half to two-thirds of our capacity in the U.S. We're the second largest exporter in the U.S. and we're proud of that position. But other than that, there's no real shift in our strategy right now.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. And as my follow-up, back to DCG. There seem to be two moving pieces. You have this declining but very profitable enterprise part, but a faster growth but perhaps less profitable networking and cloud and other areas. Is that fair characterization? And do you envision a point at which the non-enterprise parts become dominant enough, so you can actually see an acceleration in DCG back to your traditional double-digit type growth rate?
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
So let me start and then we can see. I think – our view is that enterprise will continue to decline. A lot of that is those workloads moving to the cloud. It will get to a point though where it starts to stabilize. And those – because there are still things that – workloads that will want to be in a private cloud.
At the same time, we believe as the world becomes connected, cloud will grow at a much, much faster rate. And I made a point in the prepared remarks, where if you look at the cloud of today being mostly based on people, the average person will generate about 1.5 gig of data a day. An autonomous car, when those things start hitting the road – and we've started to build these data centers for some of the trials we're working with – I mean you're talking about petabytes of data that you're having to deal with and 4,000 gigabytes a day off is the average autonomous car. You put a couple of those on the road and you need petabytes of storage to handle that. So, we do believe that the cloud will move at a faster rate as these connected devices become basically more available. That said, the cloud is becoming bigger than the enterprise.
We said enterprise is now less than 50%, and we believe the other areas that will grow, networking and storage, the adjacencies like Omni-Path fabric, Silicon Photonics, Rack Scale Design, which we're working with our partners on, it really lowers the cost of the system and re-architects how the Rack is laid out. And 3D XPoint, should dramatically – that will drive the growth for us as we go through the rest of this decade. We believe when you add those up together, this thing will go back to double-digits. When exactly that is because it's pretty hard – we're trying to grow these new nascent areas and manage the decline of enterprise, going to be hard to call exactly when. But we do still have a strong belief, and we believe the products are very compelling; that these will drive us to double-digit growth long-term.
Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
The only thing I'd add, Brian, is on the – on like-for-like product, ASPs have a tendency to be lower to the cloud service providers. But at the same time, the cloud service providers really value performance. And in terms of the mix of their product, they'll value performance and the higher-end products more than maybe enterprise as a whole.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Romit Shah of Nomura. Your line is now open.
Romit Shah - Instinet, LLC
Yes. Thank you. I just had one question. I noticed that you didn't raise the dividend in January, and Bob, I'm curious if your view on capital returns, buybacks and dividends is different than what Intel has done historically?
Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
Yeah. I think historically, the philosophy around first and foremost to invest it in organically in our capabilities has always been the first priority. That will be the same. Secondly, we'll continue to look at M&A that will strengthen our capabilities, so that's no different than the past. Third, in terms of capital returns, our expectation has been and I think we'll continue to think it this way going forward as it relates to dividend, grow it in line with non-GAAP earnings, and have it be roughly 40% of the free cash flows of the company. Those change around the margins over time, depending on the CapEx intensity of the business. But I don't expect that to change and we'll continue to look at how we move the dividend in line with that philosophy.
As I said earlier, in terms of the more holistic capital returns bucket, we will continue to offset dilution, which I think is pretty consistent with what we've done in the past. And then third, we have a great balance sheet and I do think that opportunistically when it makes sense, reducing our outstanding float is an opportunity we have as we get closer to the net cash zero position that we've been tracking forward over the last 12 months since the Altera acquisition.
So philosophically, no dramatic change, dividend in line with non-GAAP earnings growth, but trying to stay in that roughly 40% free cash flow world. And maybe if opportunities present itself, be opportunistic in share counts without limiting our financial flexibility relative to the things that matter most which is strengthening our business.

Okay. And our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Bill Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah. Hi, good afternoon. This is Bill Peterson calling for Harlan. Congratulations on a nice quarter. Coming back to the storage market, trying to understand how you view growth this year in light of obviously good sequential growth in the prior quarter, but also overlaying that with the Optane qualifications that are going on in progress. How should we view that in terms of a incremental growth driver in 2017?
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
Sure. So, if you take a look at it, as I said this is a cyclical market. If you take a look at 2016, it started out with an over-supply, came into the back half of the year with an under-supply really of capacity. We're entering 2017 with the continued tightness in supply. That makes pricing stable to better. So we expect that at least right now the estimates are through the first half. It's pretty hard to project out through the second half, and so we've kind of kept the second half relatively calm and cautious.
If you take a look at 3D XPoint, as we said, we've qualified. We've started to ship DIMM samples to the big cloud service guys. Those are targeted for 2018 revenue shipments on an SSD basis. We'll start shipping for revenue this quarter. And if you take a look at the full year, I think the estimate is it's around 10% of our total revenue is 3D XPoint.
And you know, that'll be, it could take off and it could be a little bit more than that. It could take a little while to qualify some things if it's a little off. But you should think it's around 10% of the revenue, and really ramping much, much more into 2018. What we're proud of is you get past that first hurdle of getting the first one to production ready and starting to ship samples to their cloud guys and actually getting ready to start shipping SSDs for revenue to the client devices and all that. We're pretty excited about just getting to that point right now with 3D XPoint.
Bill Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC
I appreciate the color.
Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
And just a little more tactical, the full-year for Memory was down 1% 2016 over 2015, but the momentum that you saw is that supply chain dynamic that Brian highlighted changed. And as we began to scale our own capabilities, you saw the strong exit growth of 25% in the fourth quarter. So with that going into 2017, we feel pretty good about that growth rate in the fourth quarter as we enter the new year.
Bill Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great. Appreciate the color on that. Maybe a question on the Programmable Solutions. The group has shown sequential declines in the prior two quarters versus your main competitor that has shown sequential growth, albeit modestly. You discussed taking share, and now you have the 14-nanometer based product. Wonder if you could provide some color on maybe why that group has lagged in the prior few quarters. But more importantly, when we should see the inflection in the business and how to think about growth in that business this year.
Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp.
Yeah. So let's talk about that. If I look at 2016, as we showed, we had about 7% growth over what Altera had in 2015. If you take a look at it, there's a couple of big segments that are driving that, telco, data center. And we're starting to see and in the networking space as well. Those are the big three segments. And where we started to see, as we went through especially the back half of the year, good connection between our ability to go in, and we're better together with Xeon and the FPGA as we go into that networking space. So again, as our footprint grows in networking and storage, I think it also gives us an ability to continue to bring both products to those markets. So we think in 2016, we actually gained share relative to the competition.
As we look out into 2017, we forecasted again above market growth from what we understand of the current estimates, and we believe we'll gain a little bit of share again in 2017. And remember, these markets are slow moving. You don't grow 10% share instantly because the design cycles and design conversions are relatively difficult. It's again driven by data center, networking and the Telco industry. And with Stratix 10 as we said, largest design enablements in the history of Altera. So we're really excited. We believe it brings a performance and a cost to our customers that is truly industry-leading and shifting.
And so we are very comfortable or confident in that; but again, that will really start to ship in the second half of 2017. And so I think that will be really driving growth in 2018. And really, if you think about these design cycles, that product will really continue to drive growth for probably the next three years plus just because these cycles are fairly long.

Just maybe as you look into the back half, I just wanted to make sure I heard it straight. It sounded like 14-nanometer on the server side may have some initial yield, and that would be headwind. But I'm just curious on the PC client as well. If you could just talk about the puts and takes as you ramp in 10-nanometer but you still ship a lot of 14-nanometer? What are the headwinds and tailwinds to gross margin?
Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
Yeah. The two tailwinds on the year-on-year flat are ASPs being a little bit better, and we anticipate that more on the DCG side. Secondly, unit cost being a little bit better, and we anticipate that more on the CCG side. And again, as I mentioned earlier, for DCG as we transition more from 22-nanometer to 14-nanometer, all else equal, that will be a little bit of a headwind in the early stages of yield for server on 14-nanometer.
The headwinds particularly are strong growth coming from memory and modem. So, those two dynamics themselves, good growth increasing profitability, good earnings. However, they are at a lower margins so the mix dynamic of those are real on a year-over-year basis. So good ASP, good unit costs but mix is a challenge. And then year-on-year, factory ramp both 10-nanometer and memory are a headwind for the full-year, but it gets a little bit better in the second half, the dynamic to the first half, second half; it gets a little bit better in the second half.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Thanks. And then just maybe a clarification, the $3 billion you're getting from the sale, should I assume that that goes to debt retirement like you have been using your cash flow? And I guess you should get at some point this year potentially the end of the year to that net cash zero, should we think about buybacks at that point?
Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.
I think the dynamics of the $3 billion, the intention is that roughly $1 billion comes in line at time of transaction, and that there's, we will provide our financing in the early stages, so we'll only get roughly $1 billion upfront. In terms of then just the net debt position during the course of the year, you can assume that we have some maturities in 2015 that will take out, sorry 2017, that will take out, and we believe by the end of the year, given those dynamics, will be closer to a net cash zero position.
In term of that, that gives us the much stronger balance sheet and how we think about that, we'll continue, as I said earlier, invest in business, return capital to shareholders, and opportunistically, whether it's reducing outstanding flow, that's one that we'll continue to look at, and be opportunistic as opportunities present themselves.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Intel Corporation’s Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today’s program is being recorded.
I would now like to introduce your host for today’s program Mr. Mark Henninger, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Mark Henninger
Thank you Jonathan and welcome everyone, to Intel’s third quarter 2016 earnings conference call.
By now you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with it. If you’ve not received both documents, they’re available on our investor website, intc.com. I’m joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO; Stacy Smith, our Executive Vice President of Manufacturing Sales and Operations; and our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Swan. In a moment, we’ll hear brief remarks from all three of them, followed by Q&A.
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today’s discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.
Also, a brief reminder, that this quarter we’ve provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Today we’ll be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The CFO commentary and earnings release available on intc.com include the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations.
With that, let me hand it over to Brian.
Brian Krzanich
Thanks Mark. Q3 was an outstanding quarter which produced records in a number of product lines and serves as evidence of our transformation to a company that powers the cloud of billions of smart connected devices. As a great proof point, third quarter revenue grew 9% over the last year to an all-time record of $15.8 billion on broad-based strength across our businesses.
I’d like to take a minute to share a few of the highlights with you now. I’ll start with the Client Computing Group, which had a stellar quarter. This team is focused on delivering an annual cadence of innovative new products, improving product cost and driving operational efficiencies contributed to a remarkable 37% growth in CCG operating margins.
The Client Computing Group’s revenue grew 5% over last year. But just as importantly CCG is playing in a direct and impactful role in our transformation.
In the Data Center Group, revenue grew 10% year-over-year to a record $4.5 billion. We saw the growth segments of the Data Center Group accelerating at a rate above our forecast. The Cloud Service Provider segment was up 32%. And the comp service provider segment, we continued to grow at a faster rate than the market, 16% growth as the market converts of NFE and STN and demand for our products increased.
In addition, non-CPU adjacencies across DCG grew an impressive 34%. This category includes our new omni-path high-performance fabric which is leading in performance and gaining design win momentum. It includes our Silicon Photonics and our Xeon Phi, all of which began to ramp this year.
However, enterprise revenue was down 3%, trending below our expectations of a roughly flat year-over-year. As a result, DCG revenue growth for the full-year will likely be in the high-single digits.
Another key growth opportunity for Intel, our Internet-of-Things business grew 19% over last year, setting an all-time revenue record of nearly $700 million. We saw strength across the board in retail, video and transportation segments.
Revenue in our memory business was approximately flat year-over-year. 3D NAND production at the Dalian factory is ramping ahead of schedule with yields matching those of our other production facilities. We continue to see industry enthusiasm building for our groundbreaking new memory technology 3D XPoint and we’re making steady progress towards bringing it into production.
Intel’s Programmable Solutions Group formerly Altera, was up 6% on strength in wire line, industrial and broadcast segments. I’m very pleased with the integration of Altera into Intel. We continue to execute against our deal thesis. And PST has produced three consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth compared to Altera’s results after adjusting for acquisition related accounting charges.
In the third quarter we began sampling our Stratix 10 product, Intel’s first FPGA produced on our own process technology and also the industry’s first and only 14-nanometer FPGA. We’re shipping our first co-packaged parts for the data center and are continuing to see opportunities for design wins with PST products across many of Intel’s businesses. PST’s results show the tremendous progress and execution.
The Intel Security business was up 6% over last year. Last month we announced that we will sell 51% of Intel Security to private equity first TPG and establish a jointly owned independent cyber security company named McAfee. This transaction will position McAfee to invest as an independent company while allowing Intel continues to participate in McAfee’s success and growth.
Intel’s transformation continues in restructuring program that we announced in April remains on track. I’m really proud of the work our employees are doing to accelerate our strategy. A change of this magnitude is hard. And going through it has again reinforced just how talented, committed and resilient this team is.
And finally, I’d like to welcome Bob to the Company as our Chief Financial Officer. He brings a wealth of leadership experience to Intel and his financial acumen and strategic insights will be an asset to the company.
At the same time, I’d like to thank Stacy for an outstanding nine years as CFO. He’s been a great partner and I’m excited to have his leadership in manufacturing, sales and operations moving forward.
Wrapping things up, I’m very pleased with our results in the third quarter. We introduced exciting new products, delivered strong financials and continue to realign our resources to our strategy. The progress we’re making leaves me increasingly confident in our transformation.
With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.
Stacy Smith
Thanks Brian. In the third quarter we achieved record revenue of $15.8 billion and also achieved $5.1 billion in operating income.
Revenue growth of 9% year-over-year is driven by solid growth across the Client Computing, Data Center and Internet-of-Things groups.
Gross margin at 64.8% was higher than expected and up 3 points from the second quarter. Operating income grew 18% from a year ago. Earnings per share of $0.80 were up $0.14 from a year ago. The Client Computing Group had revenue of $8.9 billion up 5% year-over-year. During the third quarter, we saw strengthening of demand and an inventory-build in the world-wide PC supply-chain.
This segment had another quarter of significant profit growth with operating profit growing 37% from a year ago, as revenue increased, cost came down and investment levels declined.
The Data Center Group had record revenue of $4.5 billion up 10% year-over-year. In the third quarter we continued to see robust growth in the cloud segment of the business, which grew over 30% year-over-year, partially offset by a 3% decline in the enterprise segment over the same horizon.
The Data Center Group had operating profit of $2.1 billion down 1% year-over-year as we increase investments and ramp Broadwell, the first 14-nanometer server product.
Our Internet-of-Things business achieved revenue of $689 million, growing 19% year-over-year, driven by strength in our retail, video and transportation segments. Operating profit for the business was $191 million up 27% year-over-year. Our memory business had revenue of $649 million down 1% year-over-year. This segment had an operating loss of $134 million as a result of start-up cost for China factory and costs associated with 3D XPoint.
The Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $425 million up 6% when compared to Altera’s results from a year ago. Operating profit was $78 million. Our security business had revenue of $537 million up 6% from a year ago. In the third quarter, we announced a newly formed jointly owned independent cyber security company called McAfee.
The transaction values the business at approximately $4.2 billion and a deal-close we expect to realize a pre-tax gain on the sale of roughly $500 million when the transaction closes in the second quarter of 2017. The costs associated with the transaction are factored into our restructuring and spending guidance. Post deal-close we will own 49% of the new company.
We are generating healthy levels of free cash flow, which enables us to invest in our business and return cash to shareholders. This has demonstrated in our third quarter results as we generated $5.8 billion cash from operations, purchased $2.5 billion in capital assets, repaid $1 billion in commercial paper, repurchased approximately $500 million of stock and paid $1.2 billion in dividends.
As we look forward to the fourth quarter of 2016, we are forecasting the mid-point of the revenue range at $15.7 billion, roughly flat to the third quarter. This is below the average seasonal increase for the fourth quarter as we expect the worldwide PC supply-chain to reduce the inventory.
Since the last earnings call, our view of second half 2016 revenue has increased as a result of strength in the client computing and Internet-of-Things Groups, partially offset by weakness in the enterprise segment of the Data Center. We’re now forecasting the mid-point of the fourth quarter gross margin to be 63%.
Spending is expected to be approximately $5.2 billion. Intel is in the midst of a significant transformation. We’re focusing on being more efficient, investing in higher-growth segments and with the McAfee transaction, we’re focusing our business on core strategic areas.
Given that I would like to provide a little more context on each. We’re on track to achieve the run-rate savings and employment reductions associated with the restructuring program announced earlier this year. And in fact we’re moving faster than we anticipated.
In addition, the deal involving the Intel Security Group, which was announced in the third quarter, will result in additional restructuring charges, a pre-tax gain and reduced spending levels in 2017. As a result of those restructuring charges and the increased mix of retirements and European severances, we’re increasing the restructuring and other charges forecast by $700 million to $2.3 billion. The majority of the remaining restructuring charges will be realized between now and the middle of 2017.
We’re on track to the original restructuring and focusing our business on core strategic areas. This is allowing incremental investments in critical areas like the Data Center, Internet-of-Things and memory.
The overall impact of the announced reductions Intel Security Group transaction and reinvestment as we expect our 2016 spending as a percent of revenue to be down almost 1 point versus 2015 and we expect to achieve another 1 point reduction in 2017 as we accelerate our transformation.
In the third quarter we achieved record revenue and strong operating profits. But since this is my last earnings call, I would like to take the opportunity to provide some historical perspective and how the company has changed over the 10 years since I’ve been attending these calls, which I really think shows the transformation of our business.
10 years ago, virtually the entirety of our business was tied to the PC market. Today, we have a diversified portfolio of growing businesses, with roughly half of our profits coming from the Data Center and Internet-of-Things businesses. We’re also a different company in terms of how we look financially. 10 years ago, our revenue was approximately $35 billion with a gross margin of 52%.
In 2016, we’re on a path to almost $59 billion in revenue with a gross margin of 63%. And over the past 10 years, we’ve increased our dividend from $0.40 per share to $1.04 per share, and we’ve repurchased about $55 billion of stock.
Looking forward, Intel is positioned with technology leadership and amazing workforce and significant market opportunity as we power the cloud at the heart of all of these smart and connected devices. I’m excited about how we’re positioned for growth and my next role in the Company and about the leadership experience and continued focus on driving long-term shareholder value that Bob will bring as CFO.
With that, let me turn it over to Bob for a few words.
Bob Swan
Thanks Stacy and thanks Brian. I’m both excited and very honored to be joining the team at Intel. The Company has had a profound impact on the world with industry-leading technologies that has a great business model driven by Moore’s Law and an outstanding balance sheet.
Additionally I’m inheriting a top-notch world-class finance organization. It’s an extremely exciting time in the company’s history as we transition from a PC-centered company to one that powers the cloud in billions of smart connected devices. I’m looking forward to the journey.
With that, let me turn the call over to Mark.
Mark Henninger
Okay. Thank you Brian, Stacy and Bob. Moving on now to the Q&A as is our normal practice we would ask each participant to ask one question and a follow-up if you have one. Jonathan, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Certainly. Our first questioner comes from the line of C.J, Muse from Evercore. Your question please.
C.J. Muse
Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, first question on DCG, you took the number down for Q4. Curious how we should think about contribution from enterprise looking into 2017, when you think that could stabilize. And then as you start to think about greater contributions from hyperscale and networking, is that 10% to 15% sustainable or should we be thinking high single digits going forward? Thank you.
Stacy Smith
Hi C.J. this is Stacy. So, let me take the first part of that question. So, yes, I mean as we just said on the call, what we’re seeing in the Data Center is very strong growth rates in the cloud, very strong growth rates in networking and storage as those areas become virtualized and our products extending to those areas.
And then we saw some weakness in the enterprise in Q3 and that’s what we’re expecting for Q4. I think we’re going to hold-off on providing a forecast for 2017 at this time. We would normally provide that to you in January and then have a much more in-depth conversation in the investor meeting in February.
C.J. Muse
Okay, very helpful. And I guess on the PC front, given the volatility there, I wouldn’t expect you guys to put the flag down and say that we’ve completely stabilized. But curious what trends you can speak to in terms of growth, perhaps, I guess in emerging markets and what that speaks to in terms of the trajectory for unit demand from here?
Brian Krzanich
Sure and I would agree, we’re not going to raise the flag and say everything is good again. But if you take a look at this quarter, what we saw was kind of an increased strength in the areas that have been strong in the past. So, definitely the mature markets were a bit stronger. The one that was probably a little bit of a shift is China, was a little bit better than we had forecasted as well.
Enterprise was again strong, consumer was better but it’s still not back to where we consider it where we would like to see the consumer side. And it was a good mix between desktop and mobile products, laptops and devices like that. So, it’s kind of an increase in what’s been strong in the past as really what drove the growth for this quarter.
Mark Henninger
Operator, please go ahead and introduce our next questioner.
Operator
Certainly. Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your question please.
Stacy Rasgon
Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, DCG revenue was up 10% year-over-year, operating profit down year-over-year. I know you had sort of highlighted some increased investments. But we also have cloud growth in networking and some of the other non-CPU stuff that’s been growing as well. How should we think about that change in the growth drivers in terms of impacting the margins over the last year? And how should we think about the likely margin trends for the business as we go into next year?
Stacy Smith
Yes, I’ll take that and then Brian, maybe want to talk about more the longer-term. But it’s not a driver what we saw in the third quarter, they really are the two issues. We have been very consciously increasing investment there, we see tremendous long-term opportunity, so that’s been an ongoing process for us. But anything that really kicked in this quarter is they’re ramping their first 14-nanometer server product which is Broadwell for the server market and those first products coming out on that product-line are fairly expensive.
To the mix question, it doesn’t really drive things probably as much as you would expect. We have very strong product margins across the portfolio of server products and the enterprise or in the Data Center ranging from enterprise to storage to networking. And in fact when we look at the server ASPs, we actually saw ASPs up kind of across the board in every one of our server categories, so MP, DP, and so it really is a mix impact of what you see happening in this quarter, where it’s a little weaker on enterprise and a little stronger in places like networking.
Brian Krzanich
Yes, and Stacy maybe this is Brian, maybe let me help you just think about the data center from a larger perspective right. As Stacy said, what you have to really take a look here is, the growth areas that we said we were going to continue to grow and the cloud service provider, the Telco, networking and storage, networking specifically is, was the more our fastest growing areas of the data center.
And in the adjacencies which are all new emerging markets for us around things like Silicon Photonics and omni-path fabric and all. All of those are growing at or above what we had forecasted and doing quite well.
And as Stacy said, across each of those, our ASPs are both increasing and if you take a look at that, even if you go down to like an Atom server, the Atom-based server, yes, their ASPs are lower but the margins are still quite healthy down there, because their costs are quite a bit lower. So you got to keep all of that into perspective as you look at the mix that goes across these.
What happens quarter is that we anticipate the enterprise to go from that low-single-digit decline to roughly flat and it just hasn’t, enterprise market hasn’t showed up there yet. We’re working on tactics to show that up over the next couple of quarters and we’re still very convinced on the long-term path of those growth areas that we described are going to be what drives the data center.
Stacy Rasgon
Thank you. For my follow-up, I’d like to touch on the last point you just made. So enterprise is, like you said was disappointed this quarter. But I mean, let’s be honest, enterprise has been in decline for years. Why would it stabilize, why would it start growing, why is the - I know we’ve probably talked about this over, why is the cloud growth that we’re seeing in the enterprise with this indicative of that cloud growth, I just - I don’t understand why we should expect that business to ever turn around? Can you give us some color on that?
Brian Krzanich
Sure. I think there is two parts to this. A certain amount of the enterprise weakness right that has occurred over the last few years is certainly driven by movement of those enterprise applications to the cloud. And we’re very comfortable it doesn’t really matter for us from a product definition or product performance standpoint whether it goes, those applications go to the cloud or whether they stay in the enterprise.
That said, there is several enterprises that we are in talks with it that all want to grow, they’re all private clouds. And they’re really looking at how best to do that, when do they do that. So I think it’s more, the customer feedback we’re getting that gives us some confidence that the enterprise side with their own private clouds will continue to see some improvement. It’s not going to be a growth area though, so don’t take this as I’m saying Stacy that this is going to be a growth segment.
What we’re saying is, given what we’re seeing from customers, we should see some level of stabilization or less of a decline didn’t show up this quarter, we’ll have to take a look at that as we move through into ‘17.
Stacy Smith
And just on a tactical basis, Stacy, to reinforce. Our forecast now for the data center for Q4 also is not including improvement in this segment of the business.
Brian Krzanich
Thanks Stacy.
Stacy Rasgon
Thanks guys.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.
Vivek Arya
Thanks for taking my question. And before I forget, thanks and good luck to Stacy in his new role.
Stacy Smith
Thank you.
Vivek Arya
So, first question is again staying on the data center theme. Can you quantify the enterprise mix in DCG now and is that required to be flat in order to maintain the double-digit growth in DCG or can it actually start growing double-digit if the growth in other areas remains at this current pace just because of the mix-effect?
Stacy Smith
So, let me take a shot at the quantification question and again I think we’ll, Brian talked about this bullishness on the long-term for the data center but we’ll hold-off on specific CAGRs in 2017 forecast to both Earnings and then the Investor Meeting.
On the, I think you were referring back to what I showed a year ago which was the size of the enterprise versus the size of the data center - or size of the cloud for the server segment of DCG and that we were heading towards a crossover between those. Again, we’ll update that explicitly come February.
But based on what we’ve seen this year with really robust growth still recurring in the cloud so, again this quarter over 30% and our weaker than expected enterprise I think that cross-over point pulls in. And then I think you have a phenomenon that says the cloud portion of the enterprise becomes so big and continues to grow at a fast pace that we can certainly maintain a robust growth rate even if the enterprise segment is not growing to slightly weak.
Vivek Arya
And as my follow-up, a longer-term question, I think there is a debate in the industry that computation is becoming parallel with this growth in deep learning and machine learning which benefits products like GPUs more than CPUs. I’m wondering would you agree with that and do you think this parallel computing market is incremental or cannibalistic for Intel? Thank you.
Brian Krzanich
Sure. So, firstly - to your first question I 100% agree with what Stacy said. And I expect that these growing segments that’s why we focus on them so much and we’ll be the dominant as we move out into the later parts of this decade.
Your question on accelerators really is what you’re asking, when you take a look at GPUs and things like deep learning, the first thing you have to separate out is things like are you talking about the deep learning on the learning portion or the scoring portion.
And so, we don’t look at accelerators as cannibalistic because you still have to have a Xeon System with those when you go to, actually do the implementation of the deep learning applications.
The second thing we tell you is that we actually had worked over the last two years or so to really implement a much broader collection of accelerators when you think about these. If you want to think about kind of the rates of performance of each one of these, you have FPGAs which are accelerators and we see those accelerators go into everything from networking devices to machine learning applications. Those have high levels of flexibility that can be programmed on the fly but maybe not quite the performance.
Then you have GPUs, GPUs do have as we say, good accelerating performance in certain linear algorithms. Those are quite good and we have our Xeon Phi in that space. And then the highest performance area, are ASIC where they’re workload specific and designed around the algorithm specifically. And you saw our applications of Nirvana; we also did an acquisition of Movidius earlier this quarter. Those are all very specific workloads around machine learning that are basic driven and even give higher performance.
So, we look at those accelerators as being enhancing this growth. You sell a Xeon typically with that so it doesn’t cannibalize the business. And we believe we have the widest really offerings of these accelerators from FPGAs through the Xeon Phi and then into basic driven devices.
Vivek Arya
Thank you.
Stacy Smith
Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.
Toshiya Hari
Thanks for taking my questions. My first one is on gross margins. In your Q4 guide, you have memory and higher factory start-up cost on 10-nanometer working against you. But I was curious when you would expect these items to fade and potentially provide a tailwind to gross margins?
Stacy Smith
Yes, so, this is Stacy, that’s a good question. So typically on the shape of start-up costs, you would expect that 10-nanometer costs go up in the back half of this year as you’re seeing they stay high into the first two to three quarters of next year and then they start to fall-off in the back half of next year. So, I’ll just stick with that for now and then we’ll let Bob to show you the kind of start-up cost trends as he thinks that that’s important.
On the memory costs, what you’re seeing is really two impacts. One; is the start-up cost associated with Dalian China factory for memory and then some of the first wafers coming out for 3D NAND and 3D XPoint. And I’d expect that that starts to get better into next year, it’s hard to pick the quarter but it should become a tailwind as we get kind of into 2017.
Toshiya Hari
Okay, great. As my follow-up I have a question on CapEx as well. Based on your annual guide, I think the implied Q4 number is close to $3.5 billion which is clearly a pretty big number. Should we take this as a new normal for Intel or is this a one-off quarter where you’re spending aggressively in both the core business and a memory and that the quarterly run rate going forward should revert to somewhere in the $2 billion to $2.5 billion range? Thank you.
Stacy Smith
Yes, I think if you go back to the guide, I think we probably talked about sometime prior April that I pointed to Q4 as probably being a pretty high CapEx quarter and it’s a combination of where we’re at in purchasing the first production that for 10-nanometer and where we’re at with the memory factory in China. So, I think you’re seeing some lumpiness, I wouldn’t run rate that out.
Brian Krzanich
Yes, this is Brian. I mean just having managed CapEx in this Company for years, you really have to take a look at our annual guidance because literally within the quarter-to-quarter the tools would push out, we’ll try and always be more efficient and where you’ll have these kinds of one-time kind of up-side things come together. So we expect our annualized run rate for this year to be the $9.5 billion or so that we forecasted and don’t expect that quarterly run rate to be indicative of Q4.
Toshiya Hari
Very helpful. Thank you so much.
Brian Krzanich
Thanks Toshiya.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your question please.
John Pitzer
Hi guys, thanks for letting me ask the question. I guess my first question is just relative to what’s embedded within PCs for the calendar fourth quarter, it’s getting a little bit more difficult to kind of track because of CCG including the mobile. And if you kind of looking at the volume growth in the September quarter, it was clearly above normal seasonal trends for the core PC businesses. So, how much below seasonal do you think PCs will be in the calendar fourth quarter and how are you guys thinking about sort of the inventory channel management in Q4?
Stacy Smith
Yes. I’d say from in-market standpoint it’s pretty seasonal. And then from our business it’s the impact that Brian and I both talked about which is, we saw some strengthening of demand in the third quarter, we saw some refilling of the pipeline which was kind of lean coming in. And then in Q4, we’re expecting kind of seasonal in-demand but some depletion of inventory pipeline. And it doesn’t take much, if you think about the size of the PC market, you’re down to changes in inventory levels across the worldwide PC supply chain it was measured in days or certainly less than a week of inventory that kind of shifts around.
John Pitzer
And then guys, and as my follow-up, all year long you guys have sort of been giving what’s turned out to be conservative gross margin guidance by quarter. You’ve been beating that guidance in part this quarter helped by all the PC volume. But I’m just kind of curious as you’ll get to calendar fourth quarter I guess I understand the headwinds coming from memory and 10-nanometer startups. But what about some of the tailwinds from 14-nanometer, I mean, you’re kind of going into a period now where you’re reaching materials in PCs on ‘14, you should start to be reaching materials on servers for ‘14. How much of a tailwind is that and are we looking at another quarter of conservative guide on the gross margin line?
Stacy Smith
I guess I can only say I’m sure Bob will do a better job of forecasting gross margin than I have done. I highlighted for you the two big items from Q3 to Q4 which are the things that are worth a point and it’s as stated the increase in 10-nanometer start-up cost and what we see going on in the memory business for the elements that I saw.
Yes, I think we’ll see some slight benefit associated with 14-nanometer, I also think will be down a little bit in terms of PC volume but those are all relatively small impacts to the gross margin forecast.
John Pitzer
Thanks guys.
Brian Krzanich
Thanks John.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.
Ross Seymore
Hi guys, my first question is on the CCG side of things. And specifically in the third quarter you talked about the ASPs year-over-year and desktops and notebooks and overall. I think the ASPs were up 6% in CCG but the desktop and notebook side were both well below that. Is that just the counter revenue still in there or is there anything we can read through on to the mobile business given those differences?
Stacy Smith
Yes, that’s a great question. So yes, and we published what we saw happen in notebook and desktop ASPs that the piece that’s missing as relatively small but it has a fairly big impact on the averages that within the phone and tablet products we saw relatively less volume in Q4 so we got our Q3, we got the mix effect. And that ASP is up dramatically on a year-on-year basis as a result of the abatement of the counter-revenue program. So that’s the missing piece you need to get to the overall platform ASP math.
Ross Seymore
So, I guess as a follow-up switching over to the OpEx side of things, Stacy, in your script you mentioned about the OpEx to revenue improving by about a point this year year-over-year and then again another point next year. Can you just walk us through a little bit about what that means either from a linearity perspective or an absolute dollar perspective? Any more color would be appreciated?
Stacy Smith
Sure. I’d be happy to do that. So, let me just, let me take you all the way back to, because I think this gets very confusing because we obviously had the restructuring program in place. We now have the spin-out or the divestiture excuse me, the Intel Security business, the timing of those things will play out differently over the course of next year. So I just thought it was best to clean all of this, up and give you one metric for the year that summarizes everything.
And so, starting with restructuring, it’s on track. When you look at the savings that we’ve already generated this year, really the only adjustment to the spending guide that we’ve made when we started the restructuring as the fact that profits and revenue is up and we have some profit and revenue dependent spending.
But you can kind of see we’re over three quarters saving on the order of $700 million, you can take of it as an annualized run rate of a little north of $1 billion of savings that then rolls into next year. Then we’ll get some incremental savings, we throw McAfee into the mix here and we’re going to make some reinvestments as we talk about some of the areas that are important, think of data center and IoT and memory.
And so, when you add all that up, it would just give you an all-in number that captures the full calendar 2017. What we’re expecting is that from the starting point of 2015, we’re down about a point in 2016. And we should be down on the order of another point next year in 2017 with all of this all-in, the restructuring, McAfee and the reinvestment. I hope that helped?
Ross Seymore
Yes, it did. Thank you. And congrats on your new gig.
Stacy Smith
Thank you, sir.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely from Citigroup. Your question please.
Chris Danely
Thanks guys. Just on the PCU, you guys were pretty much first to call the inventory burn in Q1 of this year. In terms of your call for inventory burn in the PC channel for Q4, is this reflected in your order book, is this what your customers and channel partners are telling you or is this kind of you guys think that, things were little too good in Q3 so thereafter ease up little bit in Q4?
Brian Krzanich
I’d tell you it’s a mix, we have some indications from some of our partners that they were some inventory building tied to various skews. We’re also watching the sell-through as it goes all the way through the OEMs and out into the retail sectors.
So, it’s never a guess on our part. It’s always some combination of that dataset that is what the OEMs tell us what we see in retail and our discussions with retail and even just our own, we go out and collect that data in the retail space of what people are doing, what’s the basically population density at a place like best-buy, how many people are out there, buying PC versus something else on the store.
And we compile all that data to give that forecast. Like Stacy said, we’re not talking about a major shift in the inventory, we’re talking about a couple of days, about a couple of days when you ship a million units a day is a big number, when you take a look at the ASPs and a million units a day. So, it doesn’t take a big swing, we’re not talking weeks here, we’re talking a couple of days.
Stacy Smith
And I would say, the order book is much less meaningful than it used to be because in many cases we hold inventory at a hub at our customer’s location. The cancellation policy is such that they only pull demand when they need it. We have policies to make sure we’re not creating false incentives for them to take demand they don’t want. So, while we do have some indication of what they want, it can change on a daily basis.
Chris Danely
Got it, great, and then for my follow-up a question on inventory. So sales were up over $2 billion but your inventory only went down a little bit. Can you just comment on why that happened and where utilization rates are going? What you feel comfortable as far as inventory levels go, does it worry you at all?
Stacy Smith
Yes, it came in pretty much right where I was expecting Chris. What we saw is a reduction in CPU inventory in the third quarter. And even within that a pretty sizeable reduction in first generation 14-nanometer products being replaced by second generation 14-nanometer products. So, that played out as expected. And then we saw some increases in other areas in inventory kind of non-CPU areas.
And then, we’re still on track, those looking at, we’re expecting from a sales standpoint and what we’re expecting from overall builds and yields and everything, we’re still on track to have inventory come down in Q4 which is what I signaled on the last call.
Chris Danely
Great. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Your question please.
Blayne Curtis
Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just want to circle back on DCG. Just when you look at the way September played out and as we look into December, it was enterprise really the only area that changed. And I’m just trying to understand you talked about a mix of networking, was there any difference and you had also talked about some lumpiness in cloud. Did that all play out as you expected?
Brian Krzanich
Yes, it absolutely did. We tried to talk about the numbers in the preview at the start just showing you five segments there, cloud, Telco, Networking and Storage, and then the adjacencies, they all grew at or above our forecast. Those are still, as we talked about earlier in one of the questions, growing in percentage of our overall data center business, so they weren’t quite enough to offset 3-percentage decline in the enterprise side. But absolutely that was the story for the quarter.
We’re quite happy and I think our thesis of what continues to drive their growth is holding. When we go out and talk to our partners and customers about what’s driving cloud growth, what’s going to drive the networking and storage requirements, out in time we start to look at devices like autonomous cars and the IoT network in general. All of those things are driving large requirements into those data centers in those growth segments. And so that’s what gives us the comfort that yes this will continue. And our forecasts are holding in those spaces.
Blayne Curtis
Thanks for that. And just on the non-volatile group you’ve been spending a lot of money another big CapEx in Q4 here. Can you just talk about when the capacity additions could lead to revenue and then as you look at the operating margin of that business when could it be a positive contributor?
Brian Krzanich
I’ll start with the first and then I’ll let Stacy talk about the margins. Absolutely as we said and I think Stacy said a couple of minutes ago as well, in our Dalian China Factory, we are now running wafers, the yields are quite good they’re as good as our existing factories. So you’ll see that factory now ramp through the first half roughly of next year and as most of that spending will occur in that same timeframe as far as adding the equipment to facilitate that ramp.
And from there then it’s just purely just running the volume and continuing to grow in that space. That’s primarily 3D NAND. And again, we believe we have a cost performance that is quite good relative to the rest of the market.
The 3D XPoint we are in the process of shipping samples now to customers by, as we go through this quarter, we’ll ship thousands of samples to customers. We’re targeting to start, finish qualification at the end of this quarter. And that ramp really starts it’s really a 2018 ramp for that product. So you’ll see it again, the revenue and hence the cost go down on 3D XPoint as we go into next year as well.
Stacy Smith
Yes, let me - I’ll hit on the margin but do you want to do a shout-out to the China factory team, I was just out there and I was being a little humble. The yields on their first production material matched the yields on the mature production facility which is a phenomenal result for a factory. So they’re doing quite well.
In terms of the overall margin if you look at, just focus on Q3, what we saw in Q3 is an improvement in the underlying NAND business being offset by increased start-up cost associated with Dalian China and some increased costs associated with 3D XPoint. As Brian said, when we get into the first half of next year, those products are ramping and so we should start to see pretty significant improvements in the overall P&L because that headwind if you will goes away and we have a very competitive very cost competitive product line that we’re selling in the market.
Brian Krzanich
Just a correction, the team here just caught me on. I think I had my ears off. So, on the 3D XPoint it will be qualified at the end of this quarter. And we’re shipping thousands of samples to customers, we’re shipping samples already, we’ll ship thousands through this quarter. And it ramps in 2017, I think I said by mistake 2018, I’m sorry I’m just too many years that were talking through here. So, ramp in ‘17, revenue growth in ‘17, samples, thousands in the fourth quarter and qualified at the end of the quarter. Sorry for that confusion.
Blayne Curtis
Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Rolland from Susquehanna. Your question please.
Chris Rolland
Hi guys thanks for the question. Welcome Bob and congrats on your guy’s PC number. Do you guys think that there is some cannibalization here of Broadwell from those waiting for the release of the Purley platform next year? And also, how do you guys view the value prop for Purley? You guys have a faster interface there, more pins than IO. But do you think there’s some killer feature there that makes Purley much stronger than typical platform ramp?
Brian Krzanich
Sure, so, I think I heard all of your questions. But I think your question is in, you can correct me if I got it wrong. How much of the enterprise slowdown that we saw is being driven by cannibalization basically of people waiting for Purley a.k.a. SkyLake platform and then what are the real features that we’re looking for that drive SkyLake performance? Did I get that right?
Chris Rolland
Yes. I’m just trying to gauge if there could be a reacceleration in DCG around Purley.
Brian Krzanich
So, first, it’s always very difficult for us, I mean, if you take a look at Broadwell, the Broadwell platform, the performance is quite good. What we find is that each one of these generations as long as you stay on this cost performance curve, people are willing to go buy those that are running these cloud platforms quite quickly.
And so, we’re seeing demand for Broadwell from the cloud service providers, from the networking and Telco side quite strong. So we don’t think we see if we’re going to see performance based cannibalization you’d see it in those real high-level performance sectors first actually I would think.
So, we don’t see that. On the Purley platform we’re actually starting to sample those products already to some of the leading edge customers. And they’re seeing not only just an overall TCO performance advantage that we typically see with each one of these but this also continues our integration of things like the omni-path fabric, it has more integration of the silicon photonics so it’s still the adjacency functions that are quite strong, and they will get more and better as we go through each one of these, there will be a second generation of Purley that includes 3D XPoint.
It allows pooling of memory and then there will be future ones that will allow additional pooling of things like FPGA. So, each one of these now add some additional features across the rack that really helps in the overall system performance.
Chris Rolland
Great. Thanks for that. And then a lot of discussions that I’ve had with the channel recently have been fairly positive around PC ASP increases next year. And part of this is the mix towards enterprise as consumer mix down. But others are pointing to sort of an inflection in ultrabooks, thin and light. So let’s say we got a massive ASP increase in laptops, like they’re up 10% or something like that. What kind of fall-through would we expect for CPU ASPs?
Brian Krzanich
100% of that. Firstly I do want to recognize that our OEM partners are putting out some great products. And I think you’re going to have to take a look at this and really ask, that’s a pretty interesting scenario and I’m very hesitant to this. But typically Stacy is right, if ASPs go up across the board at the system level, it tends to float all boats. So our OEM partners would see an increase, we’d see an increase, the other partners within that infrastructure would see.
We really more think of our pricing though as value base. So as we bring out new products and bring out new features we make sure that the value-based pricing is there and that people are either getting more value for the same price or quite a bit more for slightly increased price.
So, I think it’s such a unique scenario, it just over across the board, all of a sudden one day prices go up, actually we wouldn’t necessarily float through that ASP to our end-partners because we didn’t necessarily drive that from new features. If it happens with 10-nanometer launch and it’s because of features then we do have those. So we do it based on what value we provide to the end user and our OEM partners.
Stacy Smith
And if I can just add, the way we would see that is actually with a mixing app, we don’t raise our pricing but the way you articulate this, if it’s a bunch of high-end notebook, ultrathin like, we would see a mixing up of our overall demand. And in fact it is one of the phenomenons that we’ve been seeing I think we’ve done a good job of creating a differentiated product line. And this quarter we saw great sales of i7s and notebooks. So, it’s consistent with what you’re seeing in your channels.
Brian Krzanich
And probably the best example of that is the gaining space right. We continue to see, we put out the case skew, 12-core monster and we wonder how many people are going to go buy it, and we find we’re sold out. So I think that’s an example where “RSPs” go up but it’s a really a mix function. But otherwise it’s going to be, we always just do pricing based on value and features that we bring.
Chris Rolland
Great. Thanks for the detail.
Mark Henninger
And operator I think we got time for two more questions.
Operator
Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from Cowen & Company. Your question please.
Timothy Arcuri
Thank you very much. I guess, my first question is, I think you had said at the spring analyst meeting that the enterprise would be a little bit less than half of DCG this year, revenue-wise. So, can you right-size us sort of on what enterprise will be as a percentage of DCG just in the fourth quarter?
Stacy Smith
Yes, so, this is Stacy, and I think I took a stab at this earlier but let me just reiterate what I said. And to be clear, I was talking CPUs. And so if you take the slides that I showed back a year ago, we’ve seen robust growth rates in the cloud, we’ve seen less than expected growth rates in the enterprise. So if anything we’ve pulled in those cross-over points.
Beyond that we haven’t given a new percentage and that would be something that we would logically talk about when we give the longer-term perspective to the market in this coming February investor meeting.
Timothy Arcuri
Got it. Okay. And then I want to ask a question on the mobile losses. I know that you don’t break out MCG anymore. But I think I asked you last call about feeling good about this $800 million improvement in losses this year. So, I guess, that would get you to roughly a loss of $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion in the former MCG. Can you talk in light of the iPhone win, can you talk maybe how you think about the degree to which you could get further improvement in that number next year? Thanks.
Stacy Smith
Sure. So first-off let me just say as is our standard practice. We don’t talk about our customer, what technology they use inside their products in this space. So I’m not going to confirm or anything on a particular win. But I’ll take you back to the mobile last year. So, as you got right, we no longer have a mobile segment we haven’t for a while.
We had articulated that in 2015 we expected to improve the loss by $800 million we actually ended up closer to $1 billion. We said everything we know of what’s going on with counter revenue and investments and margin improvements and all of that. That we’d expect something on the order of an $800 million improvement in ‘16.
Everything I know from there would say we’re on-track or exceeding that just because we know this has gone through our restructuring, we’ve made some further disinvestments, as you just heard earlier, our volumes were little lower, our counter revenue is looking a little lower, the product margins all look good.
So, I’m not saying anything that say it’s smaller, if anything it’s going to be bigger in terms of the overall savings. And I do just want to reiterate it’s impossible for us to detangle it going forward.
So, where you really feel is in the CCG operating results. And as we started this call, they had phenomenal operating margins this quarter. And everything went right, revenue growth, they saw unit cost coming down, they’re making I think prudent disinvestment decisions. And when you add all that up they become a real kind of cash and profit driver for the company.
Timothy Arcuri
Thank you.
Stacy Smith
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our final question then comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your question please.
Harlan Sur
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On the IoT business, it’s good to see the reacceleration in growth. Can you just talk about the sustainability of the double-digits year-over-year growth trends and the sustainability of the 20%-plus operating margins on a go-forward basis? I know you mentioned broad-based strength across the verticals. Maybe you can just also talk about some of the product segments that are powering this growth?
Brian Krzanich
Yes, sure. I’m trying to make sure I really think about what question you’re asking. Can we sustain the double-digit growth? We absolutely believe that we can and we’ve tested that with our deals that we see on plate going forward, but we’ve kind of forward tested that. And we’ve looked at our product road-maps and what we’re bringing out and we got products like Atlas Peak and Atlas Peak 2 that are coming that are Broxton-based products that are quite strong and quite capable in this segment and priced and designed right for that.
But the segments are going to continue to believe, we believe the video analytics segment that continues to go well, there are other segments of the industrial segment that we believe will continue to grow on machine automation, machine factory automation think of this as factory automation.
The retail segment will continue to be an area where it continues to grow. And then automotive, and you saw us make deals for example this quarter with BMW on autonomous driving which is a little further out but that’s just an example, you’ll also see products from Land Rover and a variety of other OEMs that are a mix of everything from autonomous driving programs to in-vehicle infotainment type systems.
And those systems are quite, we’re thinking them more and more as servers on wheels as you start looking at all of the adjacencies too, they’re needing connectivity, they’re needing storage, they’re needing Silicon Photonics for moving the infotainment, basically the graphics video around the system. They use FPGAs for accelerators like we talked about earlier.
So, when we look across those segments, and we test it out, we do believe we could continue that. Those are also high compute areas and it’s what gives us the confidence in the margin functions as well. They tend to reuse a lot of our intellectual property from the PC segment and carry that down over Intel right, that’s one of the real strengths of Intel’s integrated device manufacturing kind of business model.
And so, the amount of investment required to bring those to market are less then, if you start from scratch and that’s your only product. And so that’s what gives us the confidence in the margin space as well.
Harlan Sur
Great, and then thanks for the insights there. On the cellular modem front, obviously the team is driving good success here with the 7360 this year. Looks like you guys are continuing to drive the road maps. I notice that your next-generation platform, the 7480, was just qualified at AT&T just this month. This was actually about the same time last year that you guys qualified the 7360 at AT&T.
So, now that it’s qualified, can you just help us understand when should we expect 7480 to show up in mobile devices? Would this be 2017, and any other color you can provide us in terms of other global carriers that you’ve qualified this new chipset with?
Brian Krzanich
Sure. So, I think you really want to think the modem space as really an annual cadence. And I think that’s what it’s taking us a while to get to is, to get to that annual pace. But we really believe we’re on a clip now. And as you said, the 7480 is now qualified. As we said, it’s qualified to AT&T there. We typically go then out and around the world, so you’ll see it many of the same places that the 7360 got qualified, in Europe, in China, other parts of Southeast Asia. So those will be ongoing now.
And you should just think about we’re really targeting modem technology advancements on an annual basis. And typically right, they get qualified in the third and fourth quarter of the year before and then customers start to roll-out those devices, typically more towards the second half of the following year. So you should see these things start to show up in devices in the second half of 2017.
And you should just think about that from this business from here on. We should come out with another series next year at this year with the 2018 kind of target. And that’s really our business model for the modems moving forward.
Harlan Sur
Thank you.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Intel Corporation second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Mark Henninger. You may begin.
Mark H. Henninger - Vice President-Finance & Director-IR
Thank you and welcome, everyone, to Intel's second quarter 2016 earnings conference call.
By now you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with it. If you've not received both documents, they're available on our investor website, intc.com. I'm joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO, and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them, followed by the Q&A.
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.
Also, if during this call we use any non-GAAP financial measures or references, we'll post the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliation to our website, intc.com.
So with that, let me hand it over to Brian.
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Mark.
Our top line results for the quarter came in right in line with outlook, and profitability this quarter exceeded our expectations. Year-over-year growth this quarter was 3% overall, as we transform Intel into a company that powers the cloud and billions of smart connected devices.
We continue to focus on growth in line with this transformation, as evidenced by results in the data center, IoT, and Programmable Solutions business this quarter. I'd like to take a few minutes to walk through these results and their implications.
I'll start with the Client Computing Group, where we saw a 3% decline in revenue year over year this quarter, while operating margin was up 19%. These results were a little better than we expected, as the PC supply chain reduced inventories at a slightly slower rate, while the 2-in-1 and enthusiast product lines continued to grow. We also started shipping our seventh generation Core microprocessor, formerly known as Kaby Lake, and our latest LTE modem, known as 7360.
Next, the data center, where revenue grew 5% year over year, cloud services providers grew 9%, comm service providers grew 10%, and enterprise was down 1%. We achieved some critical milestones in the quarter that give us confidence in our growing momentum as we enter the second half of the year.
In the data center, we're seeing an ongoing preference for performance up and down the pricing stack. Average selling prices increased year over year in every microprocessor product segment from Atom and Xeon D SOCs at the low end, up through Xeon and Xeon Phi at the high end. We continued to gain share in Network Infrastructure throughout the entire segment, as Intel architecture becomes the solution of choice for the transformation of the network to SDN, NFV, and 5G. The significant share gains at the low end of the Network Infrastructure segment resulted in an overall 1% decline in data center CPU average selling prices.
Progress in the data center extended beyond our CPU product lines. Our latest Xeon Phi accelerator, formerly known as Knights Landing, continued to ramp after shipping the first limited production units in December of last year. Xeon Phi revenue grew 8x in the first six months of this year versus all of 2015, gaining share in the supercomputing and machine learning segments.
Omni-Path, our high-performance computing fabric, was launched earlier this year and has already achieved 30% market segment share of the 100-gig fabric market. In June's Top 500 Supercomputing list, Omni-Path was deployed in half of the new 100-gig systems, pointing to the performance that this technology brings to the market.
This quarter, we also shipped our first silicon photonics products for revenue, the industry's only fully integrated solution. We expect DCG's adjacent product lines, including Omni-Path, silicon photonics, and Ethernet, to collectively grow more than 20% for the full year and this quarter make up 12% of DCG's revenue.
The Internet of Things business was up 2% over last year, coming in below our expectations. We saw growth in the industrial and video verticals, offset by an inventory burn after a very strong first quarter. We continue to see tremendous potential in this business.
A great example was demonstrated earlier this month when we announced our autonomous driving collaboration with BMW and Mobileye, marking a significant step for the auto industry as we work together to establish an industry standard open platform for autonomous driving. In addition, we are bringing Indian computing technology to power the next generation of BMW's highly autonomous and fully autonomous products, from the door locks to the data center.
Our Memory business was down 20% over last year and fell short of our expectations as a result of a more competitive pricing environment. While we acknowledge the cyclical and competitive nature of this business, we remain confident in our long-term growth prospects as a result of the new technologies we are bringing to this market.
Fab 68 in Dalian, China, started its initial 3D NAND wafers late in the second quarter, but ahead of schedule. We also remain on track to ship 3D XPoint SSDs, branded Optane, by the end of the year, and look forward to delivering this exciting new breakthrough in memory to the industry.
The Programmable Solutions Group, formerly known as Altera, delivered great results. PSG grew 12% over Altera's results last year on strength in comms, infrastructure, and the channel. PSG is on track to ship 14-nanometer Stratix 10 samples this year, and I'm very pleased with both the integration of this business and their strong execution.
Our Security business was up 10%, as the restructuring the team completed last year and their focused execution continues to deliver results.
And finally, our restructuring initiative that we began last quarter is solidly on track. This program is changing where and how we invest in everything from research and development to sales and marketing. In April, we announced some important changes to our roadmaps in areas like SOCs and perceptual computing. These changes are accelerating our transformation to a company that powers the cloud and the billions of smart connected computing devices while increasing the profitability in our client business. In total, we expect this initiative will drive net run rate OpEx savings of $1.4 billion by mid-2017.
Looking ahead, I'm very excited about the growing momentum heading into the second half of the year. While we remain cautious about the PC segment and continue to expect a decline in the high single digits this year, we're expecting our businesses outside of CCG to collectively deliver double-digit growth in the third quarter.
We are seeing clear signs that our strategy is working, laying a solid foundation for growth built on the data center and the Internet of Things business, reinforced by the combination of memory and FPGAs and bound together by connectivity.
With that, let me turn it over to Stacy.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Thanks, Brian.
In the second quarter, we met our financial commitments and made good progress towards our restructuring goals. Our forecast reflects growing momentum as we enter the back half of 2016.
Revenue for the second quarter was $13.5 billion, in line with expectations and up 3% year over year. Gross margin for the quarter of 62% was approximately a point higher than our expectations, primarily driven by lower platform unit costs.
Spending on R&D and MG&A was $5.2 billion, in line with our expectations. We are on track to the restructuring announced on the last earnings call, with a reduction of about 6,000 employees in the second quarter.
Operating income of $3.2 billion was down 2% from a year ago. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 20%. Earnings per share at $0.59 was down $0.03 from a year ago.
The Client Computing Group had revenue of $7.3 billion, down 3% year over year. Client Computing Group operating profit was $1.9 billion, up 19% from a year ago. This improvement is driven by lower overall spending and margin improvements in our mobile products and higher ASPs in the PC segment. The worldwide PC supply chain inventory levels came down a bit in the second quarter, and as we enter the second half they are at healthy levels.
Data Center revenue was $4 billion, up 5% year over year. The Data Center Group had operating profit of $1.8 billion, down 4% year over year, primarily driven by increased costs as we ramp 14-nanometer data center products. As we enter the second half, we expect the enterprise segment of the business to stabilize and the cloud segment growth rate to accelerate. In addition, we expect increasing ASPs as we ramp our Broadwell-based server products.
Our Internet of Things segment achieved revenue of $572 million, with year-over-year growth of 2%. Our security business had revenue of $537 million, up 10% year over year. Our memory business had revenue of $554 million, down 20% year over year. This segment had an operating loss of $224 million as a result of continued pricing pressures, higher startup costs as we ramp 3D NAND in our China factory, and increased 3D XPoint spending.
The Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $465 million, up 12% year over year when compared to Altera's results from a year ago. Operating profit was negative $62 million. This includes about $160 million in non-cash charges for inventory adjustments. Excluding these charges would result in about $100 million in positive operating profit.
Total cash balance at the end of the quarter was roughly $17.7 billion, up $2.6 billion from the first quarter. Our total debt is $28.6 billion. Our net cash balance, total cash less debt and inclusive of our other longer-term investments, is negative $5.7 billion. We are projecting to improve this net cash balance over the second half of the year.
We are generating healthy levels of free cash flow, which enable us to invest in our business and return cash to shareholders. This is demonstrated our Q2 results, as we generated $3.8 billion of cash from operations in the second quarter, purchased $2.3 billion in capital assets, and repurchased approximately $800 million of stock. In the second quarter, we also paid $1.2 billion in dividends. And as of yesterday's close of market, our dividend yield was about 3%.
As we look forward to the third quarter of 2016, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range of $14.9 billion. This forecast is at the high end of the average seasonal increase for the third quarter. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range to be 62%.
Turning to the full year 2016, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits. We continue to expect the overall PC market to be down in the high single digits, and we expect to achieve low double-digit growth in our Data Center business. Gross margin for the full year of 2016 is expected to be 62%, consistent with our prior outlook.
You can see our strategy playing out in our first half results and our expectations for the second half. We expect above-seasonal growth in the back half of the year, led by strong growth in the Data Center, Internet of Things, and Memory businesses. And for the year we expect that growth in those businesses will offset the PC market decline, and with the addition of the Programmable Solutions Group, will result in mid-single-digit revenue growth.
Additionally, we are executing to our restructuring program, which allows us to increase investments in strategically important areas, generate financial returns for our owners, and build the foundation for future financial growth.
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.
Mark H. Henninger - Vice President-Finance & Director-IR
Okay, thank you, Brian and Stacy. Moving on now to the Q&A, as is our normal practice, we would ask each participant to ask one question and one follow-up if you have one. Operator, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Our first question comes from the line of Chris Danely of Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Hey, thanks, guys, just a question on the server expectations for the second half. What's giving you the confidence that things are going to bounce back so nicely?
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure, I'll start and then Stacy can add. This is Brian, Chris. I think it's really a mix of a couple of things. One, we saw in the second quarter and we project out into the second half a bit of stabilization of the enterprise side of the market. The enterprise side was down only about 1%, which is a bit more stable than it has been. Second thing is we are ramping our Broadwell E server in the second half of the year, and so we expect strong demand. And we typically see an ASP uplift as people by up in the stack with these new server systems coming out. And we have customer signals that just indicate that there's a second half seasonal buying pattern kicking in a bit as well. So those three things are the second half keys.
And if you take a look at a broader view of this or just overall, our view of the data center and really the cloud continues to be that the cloud is going to continue to expand. It's going to be driven by the many, many machines that connect to the cloud that drive orders of magnitude more data than what the average human creates today, and that's getting to the cloud. So there's the short versus the longer-term point of view. I don't know, Stacy, if there's anything you want to add.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Perfect.
Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
And for my follow-up, you mentioned you started shipping the 7360. Was that material to Q2 or will it be material to the second half, and any comments on profitability there?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
I'm not going to talk specifically about the 7360 because our policy is to let our customers announce any design wins that they want to announce when they want to announce them.
In terms of the overall impact on financials, when I look at the second half, you'll note that we have an above-seasonal growth rate in there. The biggest driver of that is what Brian just talked about in the data center, so that's the biggest driver. We were below the average annual growth rate in the first half. We expect to be above that, low double digits, in back half, driven by the three things he talked about, in particular the cloud buying patterns that we've identified with some of those large customers. And then behind that, we see an improvement in revenue in Memory and an improvement in revenue in IoT. And so those are the big drivers as we go into the back half.
Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Stacy, you did a nice job relative to the full year guidance giving us your expectation for PC demand for the year. I'm just curious. As you look into the third quarter, the guide is the high end of normal seasonality, as you talked about. How would you characterize your view of the PC business going into Q3? And to the extent that it's still a subdued view, is this really confidence in data center, or what other parts of the business would drive above-seasonal – or high end of seasonal, sorry?
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Hey, John, how about if I start on just the view of the PC, especially into the third quarter, and then Stacy can get into where is the above-seasonal numbers coming from and all? I think if you look at the second half, we already said that Q2 ended up being a little bit better than what we had anticipated, and we had built the year at the high single digits. And if you take a look at Q2, it ended up coming at the mid-single-digit decline. We've tried to be relatively cautious as we look out into the rest of this year and built the year and the forecast around that high single-digit number set for decline of the PC. We are carrying momentum out of Q2, so there's still data that needs to be collected on how it looks. But right now we've maintained our cautious view of high single digits.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
So just to translate that into seasonality against the backdrop of what Brian just said, which is high single-digit decline in the PC business, we're expecting that segment to play out more or less seasonally, John. We tend to do a little bit better than that because of mix and ASP, but from a unit standpoint should be fairly seasonal. And then the driver is what I just talked about. The data center growth rate as we move into the back half should be significantly higher than what we saw in the first half based on stabilization in enterprise, what we see with the cloud customers, and then some ASP uplift as we ramp Broadwell server – 14-nanometer Broadwell servers into the product mix.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
That's helpful, guys. And then maybe for my follow-up, just looking at the Memory businesses, as you guys characterized, tough quarter in the June quarter. If you annualize the operating loss, it's a fairly large number. I'm just curious. Have startup costs there peaked, or do we have another couple of quarters of startup costs going up in Memory? And I guess more importantly, as Dalian ramps and you think about XPoint, how should we think about your profitability goals longer term and what the fall-through on that business looks like as revenue does start to accelerate?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
So there's a short-term and a long-term component to this. So in the short term, as I think about the second half, in rough math I'd expect a consistent loss in the second half to what we saw in the first half. I think startup costs will be slightly higher. We'll see the first production costs play through on 3D XPoint, which as you know from watching us over the years, those first production costs tend to be fairly high in any factory when you're starting it up. Offset by the underlying existing NAND business, I think it's a bit better as we go into the back half. So that's the short-term answer.
To your longer-term question, and I'll turn this over to Brian to talk about the technology, but I think the combination of 3D NAND and the cost structure we're going to achieve and then the disruptive nature of 3D XPoint, we should have a very good value proposition and a very good overall profit position for the business.
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, John, I would just echo what Stacy said. We're just now starting to ramp our 3D NAND. So as we go through this back half of this year and into next year, it's really starting to ramp up. We think large cost advantages and good performance position there. And then as we said, 3D XPoint SSDs start to ship at the end of this year, 3D XPoint DIMMs next year. And so these investments that we're making this year, which we've talked about, are really playing forward those two technologies. So we're still very bullish on the long-term prospects. The units and the gigabytes continue to grow. Our cost structure gets better and better as we go through the back half and into next year. And then 3D XPoint, as we said, will really in our minds change the whole memory storage architecture.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great, thank you so much. I wonder if you could talk about first the data center. The growth – your mid-single-digit growth for about three consecutive quarters, and I know you had higher expectations for that a few quarters ago. Can you talk about – is that entirely an enterprise phenomenon, or is that a timing issue around cloud? Just how should we think about the last few quarters of DCG?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah, I'd say – so overall, relative to the expectations we had at the beginning of the year, let's say, it's primarily enterprise driven. And then there's some – what we commonly use as lumpiness quarter on quarter. So to how you ask the question, we actually weren't surprised by the Q2 results. In fact, they came in right in line, actually just a hair above what our internal forecast was. We have I think pretty good insight into the large cloud customers, and so we had some good insight into the buying patterns as those customers went from Q1 to Q2. And now as we look at the back half, we see several purchasing cycles kicking in for some of the large guys. So we expect that the cloud piece will accelerate as we get into the back half.
Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great, that's helpful. Thank you. And then with regards to the balance sheet, I noticed both days sales outstanding and days of inventory bumped up a little bit, and I hadn't expected that. Can you just talk about what drove that?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah, those are two different things. I'll just start with the easy one, days sales outstanding. I'm not seeing anything unusual there, it's just the amount of net billing at the end of the quarter. The average day paid and all of that still looks really healthy, so I'm not seeing anything unusual there.
On the inventory side, as I talked to you last quarter, we ended Q1 higher than where I wanted to be. Our yields got better in Q1. Frankly, they got a lot better in Q2 as well. And we under-shipped a little bit in Q1 relative the units that we were expecting. So we took some actions in the second quarter to start bringing inventory levels down. What you see inside of inventory was – it was flattish, right in line with what we expected Q1 to Q2. There was a remixing, so you see some more expensive server parts and some Skylake parts going up. And then you see some of the older-generation CPUs going down. And as we get into the back half, we would expect inventory to click down and be down pretty meaningfully by the time we get to Q4.
Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great, thanks so much.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. PC gaming has been a bright spot for the team, with growth in the double-digits year-over-year range for the past number of quarters; your desktop ASPs were up again in Q2, maybe due to the strength here. It seems like the graphics guys are rolling out some new products. There appears to be a good pipeline of new games for the second half. So I guess the question is, did the PC gaming segment continue to drive double-digits growth for the team in Q2, and how do you see that trending into the second half?
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. If you take a look at it, there were three-ish, maybe four-ish major segments of the PC that did better and continue to do better than the rest of the segment and just overall. Laptops, mobile PCs continue to do better. They did better in the second quarter. 2-in-1 devices specifically are doing very well and continue to grow in double digits. And then as you said, we often call the enthusiast gaming, you see our K SKUs in there, and then you saw us also announce the X SKU, which is our new 10-core system that has been selling much, much better than what even we anticipated. And so yes, gaming and enthusiast continues to grow at a double-digit rate.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great, thanks for the insights there. And then on the deceleration in the IoT business in June, you talked about an inventory burn. Sorry if I missed this, but what vertical was that focused on? And does the team expect reacceleration on a year-over-year basis as you move into the second half of the year? And if so, what verticals are going to be driving the growth?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Let me take the revenue question, and I'll let Brian take what we see in the verticals part. It was not one vertical. If you just look at it, I think our customers got out a little ahead of their skis in the first quarter. If you remember, I think we had a 21% or 22% year-on-year growth rate in Q1. There was a little more inventory out there than we anticipated, and that took some of the – that was a bit of headwind as we started Q2.
To your question on the back half, we do expect a reacceleration. So I had said at the investor meeting that we expect double-digit growth in excess of what we had achieved last year. We still expect that. We had a strong Q1, an inventory burn in Q2, and we expect a strong Q3 and Q4.
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
And from which verticals? The verticals that have been the strongest growing for us, especially in recent, has been industrial and in the security video type applications. Those have been the two real growers. We have a lot of I'll call it longer-term growth vectors. Retail is a longer-term growth vector. And then you saw, as we mentioned on the call, the automotive ADAS section in the announcement with BMW. There are several other programs in that space as well.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to verify. On the DCG I guess growth target into the back half, it sounds like you need enterprise to keep getting better into the second half as well as for I guess the cloud and comm side of DCG to significantly reaccelerate to get there. Cloud was up 9% year over year, and it's good but that's a significant deceleration. Can you give us a feeling for what you need for enterprise into the back half and what drove the deceleration in the high-growth parts of this business into Q2?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
So I'd say – I'd characterize enterprise in the back half consistent with what we saw in Q2. If it stabilizes at that rate, that gives us the ability to grow to the levels that we're projecting. And then for the cloud, yes, you're right. It's what I said earlier. We had actually forecasted a pause in purchasing based on what we knew of the customer – the big cloud players' ordering patterns. And based on the signals we're seeing from them, we do expect a reacceleration in the back to something more consistent with what we're seeing through the last couple years.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
So what gives you confidence that enterprise will continue to stabilize and that what we saw in Q1 is not a one-quarter blip, given it's been down pretty meaningfully for the last few years pretty consistently?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
It's what we saw in Q2.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
In Q2, I mean.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yes, we saw it down slightly. And again, it's just what we see of the big enterprise customers' signals to us in terms of what they want to purchase.
Mark H. Henninger - Vice President-Finance & Director-IR

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Given that dynamic in the cloud and the enterprise side within DCG, do you still expect a crossover in the percentage of revenues that those two generate the back half of this year, or is it pulled forward a little bit – or pushed out, given the dynamics that you've described so far?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Sorry, crossover from what to what, Ross?
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
When you said – I believe at your last analyst meeting you talked about the cloud revenue, the percentage of DCG would be somewhere in the mid-30%, and that would cross over the enterprise-generated revenue in that. And that was therefore viewed as a point of acceleration for the entire group. I'm wondering, given the slower growth year to date in that business, if that crossover is going to be achieved in the time you expected.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
I'll be honest. I haven't looked at the data from that lens. But what I said – let me just take you back to the answer that I gave – I think it was to Joe's question earlier, that if you look to the expectations we had at the beginning of the year, the enterprise is a bit weaker than we thought overall for the year. And I think cloud will be in line with what we thought. So my guess is that's still true. Which quarter it happens may be a jump ball, but my guess is it's still true. But I'd like the opportunity to actually go look at the data and I can give you a crisper answer next time we talk.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. I guess as my follow-up question, sticking with DCG then, is on the gross margin side. It sounds like you're expecting some pretty significant growth, not only on the unit side of the equation in DCG but also on the ASP side. And then you also talked about some of the ASP benefits that might happen in CCG, at least in the PC portion of it. If I put that all together, I'm a little surprised that either mix or ASPs, neither of those are mentioned in your gross margin reconciliation for it to go to 62% in the third quarter. Can you talk a little bit about how those dynamics fit into your gross margin?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Sure, so first let me start with your question on data center. There's a lot in there. So I do expect an operating margin improvement in the data center as we work through this year. I think we were around mid-40% in the second quarter, and our historical range has been closer to 50%. As I expect it, that picks up some as we move into the back half. The big driver there is costs. And so the early production on the Broadwell server is fairly expensive. Costs come down as we get into the back half. And as you said, we do expect some ASP uplift in the back half.
Overall for the company, what we're seeing, so I'll just Q3 as the anchor point. We're seeing some good news in Q3 associated with higher volumes. And then the big offset there is we're seeing 10-nanometer startup costs going up pretty significantly in the back half. So that may be the piece that you're missing in the equation in Q3. That continues into Q4, by the way. We see a little bit more startup costs. If you do your algebra, you're probably coming up with a gross margin for Q4 that's about 62%. So think of that as some good things happen, but we have again an increase in startup costs and we have some of the Dalian costs with the first production of 3D XPoint that also kick in a bit more in Q4.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great, thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso of CLSA. Your line is now open.
Christopher Caso - CLSA Americas LLC
Yes, thank you, just a clarification on some of your earlier comments on inventory in PC. You talked about the customers taking down the inventory a little bit less than you had expected in Q2. Can you clarify why they chose to do that? And I guess with the inventory levels right now, where do they stand relative to where you'd expect them to be into the third quarter?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
So overall we continue to see inventory levels as being very healthy. I think that the PC, the worldwide PC supply chain has moved towards a stance of being fairly lean and fairly cautious, and we see that continuing. You would typically see an inventory burn in the second quarter. It was a little bit less of an inventory burn then what we expected. I think it goes back to Brian's comments that he made at the beginning of the call that from their perspective, the PC market was a little better in Q2, so I think they probably just brought down inventory levels a little bit less.
Christopher Caso - CLSA Americas LLC
Okay. As a follow-on to that, maybe you can clarify what you consider to be normal PC seasonality in the third quarter because I think that's been changing over the past several years. Last year, the build into the third quarter was a little stronger. Obviously, there were some product launches there. How do you characterize the build this year relative to what we've seen last year and the year before?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
So I would say for the company, you would expect to see the seasonality of revenue, seasonality for us that's in the high single digits as we go from Q2 to Q3. Our guide is a little higher than that for the reasons that we've been talking about. The PC market is probably in line with that, maybe just a pinch higher in terms of the overall PC TAM.
Christopher Caso - CLSA Americas LLC
Great, thank you.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay of Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open.
Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Yes, thank you very much. Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. I guess it's a follow-on to the DCG question that Ross had brought up in terms of margin. The DCG business is obviously going to diversify itself some going forward with some of the new products that you're introducing and the networking business taking off. The operating margin percentage is down fairly sharply year over year, and I would expect that to ramp back up some as revenue reaccelerates. But maybe, Stacy, you could talk about what the long-term margin structure looks like from an operating margin perspective in DCG as the business diversifies some. Thanks.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Sure. So we'll talk about that in more depth at the investor meeting, but I'll give you some off-the-cuff comments here. First, to just put it in perspective, the operating margin percent decline that we saw in Q2 had nothing to do with the new products, or the new products weren't driving it. It was the 14-nanometer costs of Broadwell server. And when we get into the back half, we're going to see an ASP impact associated with that because we think that the performance of that product enables customers to get a better value proposition by buying a richer mix. So that's why I'm pretty confident when we get in the back half, we see the margins snapping back towards that 50% that we've articulated as our long-term goal.
We'll talk more about the mix of products and whatnot at the investor meeting, but the one thing I'd point you to is, remember something like networking, which is an Atom-based server product that's going in, while it does have a lower ASP than the average within DCG, it has an ASP that's actually been going up and has a very different cost structure then a Xeon does. So I wouldn't just immediately assume that because it's a lower priced segment of the market that it's a margin-hindered segment of the market because that's not the case.
Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Great, thank you. That's really helpful. And then I guess to follow up on that, sticking on margin, maybe you could talk a little bit about how adding the third chip on 14-nanometer may affect margins going into 2017 in the PC business to offset some of the 10-nanometer ramp costs you had talked about. I think it's a little bit of a different dynamic than we've seen with the business traditionally with a tick-tock approach. So any broader comments you can give there about margins would be really helpful. I appreciate it, thanks.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Let me take the margin side, and then I'll let Brian come in over the top to talk a little bit about the roadmap and how we think about that from the customer's perspective. So first off, we haven't forecast 2017 margins, so we'll give you the first glimpse of that when we get to the investor meeting, and then we'll put a formal stake in the ground when we get to next January. But I would say that there's nothing that I'm seeing in the overall roadmap that for me is a significant headwind as we go in 2017. So we'll give you a lot more insight on that in a few months, but I'm not seeing anything that has me worried as we go into 2017.
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
I guess what I would talk about is Kaby Lake. So one of the things we've learned on 14 nanometers is how to make meaningful performance improvements both in the silicon and then with the silicon combined with the architecture. So we said we already started shipping Kaby Lake to our customers and OEMs. We're seeing meaningful performance across all of the various SKUs of Kaby Lake relative to Skylake. Kaby Lake is built off a Skylake core. And as a result, the die size doesn't significantly grow. So you don't see – there's no driver in the silicon itself to shift the margin structure of this product. We're able to get the performance and feature enhancements with relatively small silicon increases but good improvement on the raw silicon technology itself. So there's not an intrinsic driver that should say die size got twice as big so margins are cut. There's nothing like that.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
And it comes in on a process technology that's mature with healthy yields and a healthy cost structure. So from that perspective, you get a nice performance boost at a good cost structure.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Romit Shah of Nomura Securities. Your line is now open.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
Yes, thanks. Brian, I know that you remain cautious overall in the PC market. But when you look at some of the third-party data, it definitely seems like North America was better; Asia, Latin America a little mixed. I'm wondering, has your view, at least on a regional basis, changed at all?
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
So my regional view would say that certain of the – so North America and Western Europe has been stronger for us for some period of time, and it continues to be the stronger segment for us. As you said, South America – Latin America continues to be weak. We see weakness in Asia, but it did get a little bit better than in the past, and that combined with North America were the two drivers that made Q2 perform better than what we had modeled in our high single digits. And as I said, I'm being relatively cautious in this and making sure that we put an estimate out there that we are very comfortable with, and that's why we have gone with – stuck with our high single-digit view of the year.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
The other thing that's been reported is that commercial models have seen some momentum. Windows 10 has been a catalyst. Your view on commercial enterprise, has that improved at all over the last 90 days?
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes, and we're hearing that same thing from our customers. And as we go out and talk to CIOs, we're hearing the same thing. Those cycles, though, can sometimes take – you'll hear of them, and they sometimes can take some time to really kick in. So again, we've built that into the cautiousness of the second half and making sure that we know what we're going into the second half with. But we are hearing similar things around the enterprise conversion. It's comfort with Windows 10, ability to make that transition, and wanting to do it on new hardware.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
Great, thank you.
Operator
Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC
Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question on XPoint. You talked about stronger growth expectations looking out over the next couple years. I'm just curious if you could share what conversations you've had with customers, what use cases you've uncovered, and any thoughts in terms of sizing the market.
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
So we haven't really tried to – we have pretty widespread guesstimates and models right now on sizing the market because we're still really learning. We've actually started to ship some sample units to customers already to let them try out and start to learn. Those are to the big, call it service providers, is mostly who we're sending those to. You're going to see it enter as SSDs. You'll see those SSDs, both enterprise-class SSDs and also commercial consumer type SSDs, we demonstrated in several live demonstrations anywhere from 5x to 7x, 8x, 9x, 10x improvement in performance depending on the workload through those SSDs. So you're going to see those be the first implications.
When I think about where the big volume will come from, I think it will come in that DIMM form factor. You're going to see it in cloud applications, everything from machine learning, big data. Anyplace where you have memory-intensive and where you can do in-memory applications, the 3D XPoint is going to be nicely configured for that. It allows you to bring large amounts of storage-like data into a memory-like performance. And that's the real key here.
I also believe you'll see it in consumer devices. You'll see laptops and devices like that. Gaming machines, we think it will have gaming applications where you can preload in a cache-like environment the next level of your game, and so it loads almost instantly as you transition within the game. So there's going to be a variety of those. And actually the more we go and start to play with it, start to give it out to customers, the more types of applications and workloads we're finding that it can be used for.
C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC
That's very helpful. And I guess as a quick follow-up, Stacy, can you provide an update on your targeted capital structure here, and at what point with net leverage – net cash we should start to see more aggressive buybacks?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Sure. As I communicated I think at the investor meeting or in the last six months, our goal is to get back to net cash zero. At one point I predicted that that would happen in the back half of this year. The combination of business levels being lower from what we thought at the beginning of the year as well as some pretty significant restructuring charges will push that out, so that will happen sometime in 2017, although I do think we'll make good progress towards net cash zero as we move into the back half. Today, our net debt level is right around $5 billion, so we'll take a big chunk out of that as we move into the back half.
In terms of then – now that said, we're still generating excess free cash flow. You can see that even in the first half, even inclusive of the restructuring charges we did. And so you can see we did I think $1.6 billion of buybacks in the first half, and we have a dividend yield that as of yesterday was about 3%. So I think you see us executing to the priorities that we had articulated.
Mark H. Henninger - Vice President-Finance & Director-IR
Thanks, C.J. And, operator, I think we have time for two more questions.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thanks for taking my question. For my first one, Brian, I'm curious. There are expectations of Intel becoming successful with your 4G modems in the back half, and I'm curious. How's the longer-term visibility around sustaining growth in the business and just the timing as to when you can bring those products from foundry to your own fabs?
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure, so let's just talk about modems. Really to stay on a leading-edge modem, you need to have a yearly cadence of modem technology. And so we have just that, a yearly cadence laid out. We had the 7260 last year, we have the 7360 this year. We have a series of modems out. We've got them built out and planned for the next several years. We haven't publicly stated when we'll bring it inside, but clearly we plan to. We'll do that when the right point of intercepting the roadmap and getting the right performance off the 14-nanometer is required. Right now, I'm more concerned about getting the leading-edge momentum going for us with the 7360 and then the follow-on in 2017 and really showing that we are a world-class modem company.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
All right. And as my follow-up, staying on the DCG team, are you still comfortable this can be a double-digit growth business over the longer term? And I guess as part of that, what role does competition play into it with all the recent noise around SoftBank buying ARM and presumably putting more resources into it? I understand there are no near-term implications. But just longer term, how do you think about growth and competition in DCG? Thank you.
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure, so let me try and talk about why I am so confident in growth. We can talk about competition, and then we'll see if that does not answer your question. When I think of the cloud, the cloud that we have today is really built on the backs of people. It's your Facebook data, it's your Salesforce data, it's your Twitter data. It's all data that is really across the devices that we pretty much handle day to day. The current estimates are, if you look out into 2020, that average person will generate about 1.5 gigabytes a day of data off those devices, and those are going to be all your posts and pictures and all that kind of information.
If you take a look at the average autonomous car in 2020, the estimates right now are it will throw off about 40 gigabytes a minute of data. If you take a look at the average autonomous drone doing some kind of scan, looking for somebody lost in the forest or scanning a mine, it's going to throw off about 20 gigabytes a minute. If you take something like our replay technology that is filming in virtual reality, a basketball game or a football game, it's throwing off 200 gigabytes a minute right now. And as we continue to refine the accuracy of that, that number will likely just grow. So it's that growth in data and the need to both process it at the edge and then through the data center and into the cloud, to be able to store it, to be able to apply machine learning to all of those applications. Those all tell me that the cloud is going to continue to grow.
It's going to be lumpy. These guys don't build out their data centers in a linear fashion. They build out a big chunk of overcapacity so that they can go and then sell that and have expansion space, and they don't build for a while. And so I know people worry about is it slowing down? But these trends in data that tell me no, it's not slowing down over the long term, and what you're really going to see is just the buying patterns and the build-outs of the various structures that are going up.
As far as competition, there's always going to be competition in this market. I expect it. That's okay. We think of ourselves as competition, in fact. We are built on a model that says we have to build a continuous improvement of our products such that we are replacing ourselves with a better cost-per-performance model over time. And so we know that just even if there was no competition, the competition is we've got to build a product that's better and drives replacement as well as growth. And so I look at the competition as it's welcome. It keeps us better. It's always been out there. There will always be somebody out there. But really what we have to do is build products that are so competitive that people want to replace our products with our new product. That then is one of the best models to use for making sure you stay ahead.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Great, thank you.
Mark H. Henninger - Vice President-Finance & Director-IR
Thanks, Vivek. Operator, can you please go ahead and introduce our first questioner – or last questioner, excuse me?
Operator
Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of David Wong of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thanks very much. Just following up from the earlier round, can you give us some feel for your attitude to total amount of debt? You have a goal of net cash neutrality, but you have an upper limit on the total amount of debt you're willing to carry. Might you choose at some point to repatriate overseas cash to bring down debt or pay dividends and stock purchases?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Wow, so there certainly is a limit to the amount of overall debt that I feel comfortable with, but it's not something that we've articulated externally, and it will vary by the size of the company and the cash flow. To my philosophy, just generally I'm not a believer in taking on debt to do stock buybacks. You really have not seen us do that. Obviously, it's a board decision, but I'm just sharing with you my view of it. I wouldn't take on debt in order to do buybacks or to do a special dividend or anything like that.
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Great, thanks very much.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
You're welcome.
Mark H. Henninger - Vice President-Finance & Director-IR

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Intel Corporation Q1 2016 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference to Mark Henninger, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.
Mark H. Henninger - Vice President-Finance & Director-IR
Thank you, Nicole, and welcome, everyone, to Intel's first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. By now, you should have received a copy of our earnings release, CFO commentary and the announcement of our restructuring program. If you've not received all three documents, they're available on our investor website, intc.com.
I'm joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO; and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them, followed by the Q&A. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.
And a brief reminder that this quarter, we provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, following the acquisition of Altera, now our Programmable Solutions Group. Today, we will be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures. The CFO commentary and earnings release available on intc.com include the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations.
With that out of the way, let me turn it over to Brian.
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Mark. Our results in Q1 were in the lower half of the range we set in January and reflect an extra work week in the quarter. Revenue increased year-over-year, driven by an expanding business portfolio that now includes the Programmable Solutions Group, formerly known as Altera. Strength in our Data Center, Internet of Things and Programmable Solutions businesses partially offset weaker-than-expected PC revenues in our Client business. I'll take a minute to review our Q1 results before talking about the restructuring program we're announcing today.
CCG revenue grew 2% year-over-year. We saw ongoing declines in the PC TAM, particularly in China and other emerging markets, which also led to greater-than-anticipated reductions in worldwide PC supply chain inventory. Declines in the PC segment were offset by a richer core mix and the 14th work week.
The Data Center business posted another good quarter, growing 9% over last year on strong cloud and comms service provider demand, partially offset by ongoing softness in the enterprise. The Internet of Things Group grew a remarkable 22% year-over-year due largely to the performance of the video and retail verticals. In the Memory business, strong unit growth was offset by pricing declines leading to revenue that was 6% lower year-over-year, and in our Security business, revenue grew 12%, as this team continues to tighten its focus and execution.
And finally the PSG Group, formerly known as Altera, got off to a great start. It delivered a revenue of $359 million. And after adjusting for $100 million in acquisition-related accounting charges, the business achieved mid-single-digit growth. In less than a quarter after the deal closed, we are shipping our first FPGA Xeon co-packaged parts to customers in sample form.
These results tell the story of Intel's ongoing strategic transformation, which is progressing well and will accelerate in 2016. We are evolving from a PC company to a company that powers the cloud and billions of smart connected and computing devices. The Data Center and Internet of Things businesses are now Intel's primary growth engines, and combined with Memory and FPGAs form and fuel a virtuous cycle of growth.
Last year, we achieved record revenue in the Data Center, Internet of Things and Memory businesses. They delivered a combined $2.2 billion in revenue growth and made up 40% of our total revenue and contributed the majority of our operating profit.
Today, we announced a series of actions that will build on the strength of those franchises and accelerate our strategic transformation. Through this initiative, we will intensify our investments in the products and technologies that fuel the growth in the Data Center, IoT, Memory and FPGA businesses. And we expect it will result in an even more profitable Client business.
These changes will reduce our global employment by about 12,000 positions by mid-2017. We'll do this through site consolidation, voluntary and involuntary separations, project reevaluation and an intensified focus on efficiency across a variety of programs. These are not changes we take lightly. We will be saying goodbye to colleagues who have played an important role in Intel's success. Yet acting now gives us flexibility, flexibility to continue to invest in those Client segments that are growing, including 2-in-1, gaming, and home gateway, among others.
Even more importantly, acting now enables us to increase our investments in areas that are critical to our future success. This restructuring program will allow us to expand our investments in the Data Center, the Internet of Things, Memory and connectivity, even as we reduce our spending run rate by roughly $1.4 billion by mid-2017. This is a comprehensive initiative. It's designed to create long-term value by accelerating the fundamental long-term change already happening at the company today. We will emerge as a more collaborative, productive team with broader reach and sharper execution and we expect it to result in the highest revenue per employee in the company's history.
Last, but certainly not least, we have one additional announcement today. I'm happy to share that Stacy Smith will be taking on a broader new role within Intel and reporting to me, leading sales, manufacturing and operations. Stacy has been a great business partner and a world-class CFO and I'm looking forward to continuing the partnership as he brings his leadership, his depth of knowledge, and his breadth into these critically important areas for Intel's future. We expect this transition to occur over the next few months, following a formal CFO search that will assess internal and external candidates. Stacy will remain in his CFO role throughout the search and transition process. Congratulations, Stacy.
And with that, let me turn the call over to you.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Thank you very much, Brian, and I really appreciate the kind words.
Revenue for the first quarter was $13.8 billion, up 8% year-over-year. The quarter showed year-on-year growth and was in the low end of the range of our prior outlook. Within this, we are seeing growth in the Data Center, Internet of Things, Security and Programmable Solutions Groups, all of which helped offset a weak PC market.
First quarter gross margin of 62.7% was approximately a point higher than our expectations, driven by lower 14nm costs. R&D and MG&A was $5.4 billion, down over $100 million from our guidance. Operating income of $3.3 billion was up 13% from a year ago. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.4%, about seven points lower than our prior outlook. Earnings per share of $0.54 was up 20% from a year ago.
The Client Computing Group had revenue of $7.5 billion, a 2% increase year-over-year. This was below our expectations due to a weaker-than-expected PC market. Operating profit for the Client Computing Group was $1.9 billion, up 34% from a year ago. This improvement is driven by lower 14nm unit costs on notebooks, lower overall total spending and margin improvements in our mobile products. Data Center Group had revenue of $4 billion, delivering 9% growth on a year-over-year basis. Relative to our expectations, we saw a weaker enterprise business offset by strength in the cloud segment. The Data Center Group had operating profit of $1.8 billion, up 4% year-over-year as we ramp are 14nm server products.
Our Internet of Things segment achieved revenue of $651 million, with year-over-year growth of 22%. We saw strength in both the retail and video display segments of our business. Internet of Things operating profit was $123 million, up over 40% relative to last year. Our Security business had revenue of $537 million, up 12% year-over-year. Our Memory business had revenue of $557 million, up 6% year-over-year. The segment had an operating loss of $95 million as a result of challenging pricing, increased 3D XPoint spending and startup costs as we ramp 3D NAND in our China factory.
The Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $359 million. When adjusted for the approximately $100 million of deferred revenue and compared to Altera's results from a year ago, the business achieved mid-single-digit revenue growth. Operating profit was a negative $200 million. This included over $300 million in non-cash charges for deferred revenue and inventory adjustments plus certain acquisition-related charges. Excluding these charges would result in low double-digit operating margin growth for this business.
We generated $4.1 billion of cash from operations in the first quarter. We purchased $1.3 billion in capital assets, paid $1.2 billion in dividends and repurchased approximately $800 million of stock in the first quarter. Total cash balance at the end of the quarter was roughly $15 billion, down $10 billion from the prior quarter as a result of closing the Altera acquisition. Our total debt is approximately $25 billion, consistent with our prior commentary on the financing plan for the Altera acquisition.
As we look forward to the second quarter of 2016, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $13.5 billion. After adjusting for the extra work week in the first quarter, this forecast is in the low end of the average seasonal increase for the second quarter. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range to be 61%, plus or minus a couple of points. This decrease in comparison to the first quarter is driven by lower platform volumes.
Turning to the full year 2016, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits from 2015, down from the prior guidance. We are forecasting robust growth rates in the Data Center, Internet of Things, Non-Volatile Memory Solutions and Programmable Solutions Groups, which we expect to offset the decline in the Client Computing Group. We now expect the PC markets to decline in the high single digits in 2016 versus our prior forecast of mid-single-digit decline.
Our projection of the PC market remains more cautions than third-party estimates. We are forecasting the midpoint of the full year gross margin to be 62%, a one-point decrease from the prior outlook driven by lower platform volumes. Our execution of our strategy is driving growth. We are building on our strong position in Client and are investing for growth in the Data Center, Internet of Things markets and disruptive differentiated memory technology.
The trends over the last two years demonstrate that we are well into this transformational journey. From 2013 to 2015, the PC TAM declined 10%, yet Intel's revenue grew 5% and our operating profit grew 14% over this horizon. But as Brian mentioned, we want to accelerate that execution. In order to do that, we're going to go through a significant restructuring over the next several months. The goal is to come out of this more agile, more efficient, with more investment on our key growth initiatives and more profitable.
When completed by mid-2017, these actions will result in a 12,000-person workforce reduction and a $1.4 billion reduction to our spending run rate. Relative to full-year 2016, we are now revising our spending guidance down by over $700 million to $20.6 billion. We expect to realize over half of the total workforce reduction by the end of this year.
In the second quarter of this year, we are taking a $1.2 billion restructuring charge on the GAAP P&L as an estimate for the related actions. These actions are significant, and we don't embark on this lightly. But we are confident that they will build on the strong position we have across markets and accelerate the transformation of the company that is already underway.
I would like to end on a brief personal note by saying thank you to Brian for the upcoming new leadership opportunity. Intel changes the world with amazing technology, and I am proud of what we have accomplished and I'm excited about the opportunity that's in front of us.
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.
Mark H. Henninger - Vice President-Finance & Director-IR
All right, thank you, Brian and Stacy. Moving on now to the Q&A, as is our normal practice, we would ask each participant to ask one question and just one follow-up if you have one. Nicole, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I guess first and foremost, B.K., if you can, go into a little bit more about what led to the restructuring announcement. Not only the one today, but there have been significant changes in senior management over the last three months. So if you could, just talk us through some of what's changed strategically in the company that's led to such a large amount of turnover so recently.
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. If you take a look at it, so let's step back for a second and just talk about why are we doing the restructuring now, and then we can talk about some of the specifics beyond that. So we've talked about this transformation, that we're moving from a client-centric – Intel's been typically known as the PC company, to a company that is focused more and more on a much broader set of products and really focused around the cloud, and the cloud and all the connected devices that connect to that cloud and the connectivity that brings those devices to the cloud. And that includes the PC, but it's much more than that.
And so what this effort around the restructuring is, is to say it's time now to try and – we've made enough progress. You take a look at it, 40% of our revenue, 60% of our margin comes from areas other than the PC right now. It's time to make this transition and push the company over all the way to that strategy and that strategic direction. So that's why we wanted to do it now.
Let's talk then about the leadership changes. There have really only been three leadership changes, if we just take the last couple of quarters. We had Doug Davis, he's simply retiring. Those are personal reasons. It has nothing to do with his leadership or direction of the company. It's IoT. We've talked about IoT as one of our growth segments that grew 22% this quarter. (16:19) performance in the group is strong. And he's staying until we find a successor, roughly the end of the year we think, something like that. Kirk chose to leave for some outside opportunities.
And the one with Stacy, Stacy and I have been working for several months, actually several quarters, on what does he do next, how do we grow his both exposure to other parts of the company, but also let the rest of the company see his leadership style. And so what we wanted to do is as soon as we'd made the decision to go ahead and start a search and start looking for a CFO replacement, we wanted to be completely transparent, be very open about that and let everyone know. It's just going to be an orderly transition. We are just going to start the search, see if Stacy's solid in the CFO seat in the meantime. But this gives him a chance to see other parts of the company. If you take a look at the group manufacturing operations, which is everything from purchasing to building construction and all, and sales, it's roughly half the company and people, and so it's a really good opportunity to see how the real operations of the company work.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good, thanks for all those details. I guess my follow-up would be the full-year guidance of mid-single-digit growth, when I put that together with the high single-digit decline now that you have in the PC business, I'm having a little hard time seeing how if you take the seasonality of PCs out of the equation in large part, what would be the lever that would get you there in the back half of the year, considering that a ramp to well into the $15 billion range in revenue seems to be a prerequisite? Are there some moving parts you could describe to us that get you comfortable with that number?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Sure. Let me walk you through how we're viewing the year. And first let me just put it at the highest level. What we're projecting for the year is overall growth, and we think we'll see growth in the data center, growth in IoT, growth in memory that's offsetting some. And of course we have added in Altera now into our product family. And so you take that, and that's offsetting some of the weakness that we're seeing in the PC market.
Specific to the PC market, as we said in our prepared remarks, we are now expecting that the PC market is down in the high single digits, and when we started the year we were in the mid-single-digits decline.
The linearity, so first you have to understand. The first half is impacted by the fact that as our customers' view of the market came down, and if you recall, we had a more cautious view of the market than they did when we started the year, that they were bringing down inventory levels. That impacted us in Q1, and I think you'll see the same impact as we forecast a roughly seasonal second quarter; that we'll continue to see those customers burning off inventory. We think that doesn't repeat in the back half. So that's a little bit of a tailwind.
I'd also say you want to be careful of – we guided to mid-single digits. That's a range. If you're mathematically trying to drive to a specific number there, you may be driving more back end than what we're really anticipating. So just a caution there that that's a range that's meant to be directional of how we see the business. All of that said, I just want to say I think Brian and I are very comfortable with the back end and what's implied in our guide based on everything that we know.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis of Barclays. Your line is now open.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Yes, thanks for taking my question. I really just wanted to follow up on the restructuring. Is it more an effort to make the Client more profitable, or are you really trying to drive revenue and re-signing maybe more employees than you're letting go?
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
So it is absolutely a situation where we are restructuring to be able to allow ourselves to invest at a faster rate in those growth areas. If you take a look at it, 2016 to 2015 in the areas of Memory with our NAND technology, IoT, data center, even before this action, we were investing more in 2016 than in 2015 in those areas. This will allow us to – even with the cuts, even with the dollar figures that Stacy has read out on the savings, it's allowing us to invest even more in those segments.
And I always want to make sure it's not just about cutting costs necessarily in the Client area. We think that we can become more focused. There are areas in the Client space that are growing. 2-in-1s are growing at double-digit rates year-over-year. Our gaming PCs are growing at double-digit rates year-over-year. Set-top boxes are growing, and we're gaining share in the set-top box space. So we are doing very well in segments that are growing in the Client space and the PC space. And we are going to continue to double down, focus on those. So it's really a narrowing down and allowing us as a result also to invest more in those growth areas. That's really what we're doing here with this restructuring.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
And, Blayne, just to make sure, if you look at the CFO commentary, just to give – kind of make sure the financial answer is clear there, that the $1.4 billion in run rate savings is a net number. So I just want to be clear on that. That's what we expect to achieve, and that is encompassing the fact, like Brian said, that we'll be increasing investments in a lot of different areas.
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Correct.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Thanks. And then I know mobile is within Client, but I was wondering if that's a segment that you expect to contribute to growth this year, and if you could just talk about your confidence in reaching the cost savings for the year?
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. Absolutely on schedule for hitting our committed $800 million and just like last year, we'll shoot to do better than that. Mobile is absolutely continuing to grow for us as a segment, and we are continuing to increase our profitability. If you look underneath the numbers here, you'll see that the profitability within the mobile space continues to improve for us this year over last year.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yes, you can really see it, Blayne, in the CCG operating profit, that's up over 30%, which is on roughly flat revenues, revenues that were up a little bit, and when you parse out the big contributions there, there's some ASP good news, but the really big chunks are the improvement in the margin on our mobile products and decreases in investments that we talked to you about in the past that were all included in that mobile profitability. So you will see this play out in the CCG profitability over the course this year, and you can see it in Q1.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I'm trying to see if you can be just a bit more specific on your full year view. Does the team anticipate double-digit growth this year in PCG? And if I look at it fundamentally, I mean cloud and hyperscale CapEx looks to be up this year. There seems to be a big upgrade cycle in networking with the move to 25-gigabit. You guys are rolling out 14nm Broadwell. Can you guys just be a bit more specific on expectations for DCG growth?
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. You did a great job explaining exactly why we believe that the data center will continue in double-digit growth this year. And if you take a look at the numbers that Stacy has talked about, they incorporate double-digit growth and it's for exactly those reasons. We believe we have great products that we are introducing with the Broadwell lineup. We have got – we started shipping our first Xeon plus FPGA samples to customers, which was part of our additional gaining more footprint and more performance in certain segments of the Data Center.
We're shipping an Omni-Path Fabric now. Later this year, we will have Silicon Photonics. We've got 3D XPoint starting to be sampled, and will start to ramp later this year. So we're very confident on our Data Center roadmap and we are still absolutely forecasting double-digit growth in that space.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great, thanks for the insights there. And then in the Memory Solutions Group, I mean that's a business that grew 20% last year. I think it was up year-over-year every single quarter last year, obviously it was down in Q1. You guys mentioned aggressive price declines. Can you just talk about some of the trends that you're seeing there? Are the sharp declines more focused on capacity or performance optimized SSDs? And then you also mentioned your view on a strong growth outlook for the full year. So what drives the acceleration from the Q1 decline?
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. So let me start, and then we can just talk about – remember the majority of our Memory space is built into SSDs that are going into the Data Center. So you call those, really those higher end performance class systems. What we are seeing, if you take a look at the units, units grew quite nicely year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter for the Memory Group. You are right. We are seeing aggressive pricing in this space. The Memory segment, the NAND segment especially tends to go on these cycles where there's overcapacity in the industry and aggressive pricing, and then it shifts back to more normal pricing, and then tight pricing, which is always very positive.
So this is just a normal cycle. We think we've done a very good job of structuring the business that we ride through these with a high degree of confidence. If I look forward, we believe the 3D NAND technology that we're just beginning to ramp in our factories today and we're building out the Dalian factory for later this year startup, gives us a real cost advantage in this space and will allow us to even be more profitable in even these kinds of environments.
So we are still confident that this business will continue to grow. We will ride through this capacity situation within the industry and our 3D NAND technology will position us very nicely as we move out of this and start up our Dalian factory in China.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great, thank you.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
And the operating margin, Harlan, you're looking at that?
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yes.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Part of it is the competitive pricing environment that Brian is talking about, but there's a big piece of that that is associated with the investments that we are making in 3D XPoint and the startup costs associated with the factory in China. And it just points to, yes, it's cyclically a tough time in what we consider a very good business and we're investing in technology that we think give us a very strong position as we go forward.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
I understand. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Bernstein Research
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one on DCG in the quarter, so up 9% year over year, but that was with the extra week. Can you tell us what it might have been year over year without the extra week? And why did pricing fall again this quarter?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yes, so like we said when we started the quarter, that extra week was that week between Christmas and New Year's. When you look at where that 14th week fell, it's a relatively light week. It certainly had some impact, so I don't want to say, none, but it's a little hard to figure it out on any given business. It certainly had some impact on DCG though.
In terms of the pricing, it's pretty simple in that it was the growth rate that we saw in the networking segment. So what you would see if – the constant mix, we would have seen ASP up in the Data Center. But the networking segment grew 60% year on year, which is exactly consistent with our strategy. And so what you see there is strong unit growth offset by a little bit of a mix down.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Bernstein Research
Got it, thank you. For my follow-up, I just wanted to touch on channel inventories. So you had your notebook and desktop volumes I guess down kind of low single digits year over year. I think it's fair to say the PC builds in the industry were down quite a bit more than that. I mean, you suggest that you drained out – I guess that the channel drained on inventory. What happened with your own inventory in the channel? And how do you see that changing for the rest of the year?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
You said own inventory in the channel...
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Bernstein Research
The stuff you're shipping into the channel because it seems like your performance year-over-year was quite a bit better than what the industry was? I mean maybe it's some share gains, maybe it's the extra week. However, you just said the extra week didn't amount for very much. So can you explain the differential between your year-over-year unit shipment performance in PCs and what the market seems to be doing?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
So I would point to two things relative to the overall – like what we saw from our customers. One is, yes, we had a 14th week. That's going to make our compares different from a IDC and a Gartner for sure. But then the second thing is when you look at the results of our customer base, they would see a weaker quarter and I think that's because they were catching up to our view of the market and bringing inventory levels down. So, we were impacted by two things. I'll put it like that. We were impacted by a TAM that wasn't terribly strong and the fact that our customers were bringing their inventory levels down some.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Romit Shah of Nomura. Your line is now open.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
Yes. Thanks very much. Stacy, you're below your run rate on CapEx in Q1, and I know you reiterated for the year, but curious if you're giving yourself flexibility in case the second half doesn't prove out to be as strong as you guys are anticipating?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
No. What's going on there is that when you look at the two items that really dominated our CapEx this year, it's 10 nm capacity, so it's getting that first production capability in place. And it's the ramp of the Memory factory in China, and those are both backend loaded, so that causes the linearity to be off a little bit.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
Okay, thanks. And then just staying on the theme of CapEx with the restructuring you guys are talking about, site consolidation, and I'm wondering if longer-term, there will be an impact to the capital expenditures required to support the business and, by extension, free cash flow.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
I'd say the same answer. When you look at those two items that are the majority of what we're spending the CapEx on, 10nm and Memory, neither one of those is impacted by the restructuring, and so we haven't let our foot off the gas one bit on those two things.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI
Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess I had a follow-up on DCG. Thank you for the commentary around the pricing around network. I'm curious how we should think about the mix shift through as we go through 2016, and here curious in terms of presumably slowing enterprise and an uptick in hyperscale and what that means to ASPs. And then as you layer in ongoing growth in networking, how we should think about platform versus ASPs moving through the year?
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure, a bit of a complex question, so let me try and give you a lot of data that I hope will answer various parts of that question. So first, the simple answer. If you take a look at our forecast, we continue to forecast ASPs increasing through this year, so that's absolutely built into our forecast. And we've modeled in things like you described, the weaker enterprise computing and the difference between the pricing segments. And I always remind people that – let's just start at the very top. When you take a look at the Data Center, it's not one product. It's a family of products that really span from Xeon Phis that sell for several thousand dollars to networking processors that are a few hundred dollars at times.
But within each one of those families, so whether you have networking or cloud or hyperscale or enterprise computing, our ASPs are increasing. And that's mostly due to bringing in better products, people buying up the ladder in product and resulting in a higher ASP on average for any one of those segments. So you will see slight shifts in the overall Data Center ASP. We have a boomer quarter like this, like Stacy talked about. Networking is a little bit higher or something like that, but if you take a look inside any one of those segments, ASPs are increasing and our forecast for the overall segment for the year is an increasing ASP. It's driven by people buying up the stock, and that's because we're bringing more performance for a better price to those customers.
C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI
That's very helpful. And I guess as a quick follow-up, you outlined the cost savings, but it doesn't appear as though there's really anything on the COGS side, so curious if you see cost savings on that front as well.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Certainly. We are equally focused on efficiencies in the factory space. There's a little bit baked into the 2016 gross margin. I think you'll see a bit more of it kick in, in 2017. And just realize the labor cost in the factories is a relatively small component. The real opportunity for us is some of the other things around capital efficiency and how fast we convert over processes and things like that, and that takes a little while to play through.
C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI
That's very helpful. Thank you.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. I guess my first one, I wanted to get a little bit more into profitability within the Data Center Group. Revenue was down about $309 million sequentially. Operating profit was down $411 million sequentially. I know there are lots of moving parts. You had the extra week of OpEx that might not have been fully covered by revenue. And, Stacy, you talked about in your opening comments the 14nm ramp starting to hit there.
But with this new narrative of declining ASPs because of mix, I'm wondering if you could tell me how we should be thinking about operating profits in the business going forward. I think it was about 44% in the March quarter, down pretty significantly in the December quarter. Is this change in mix also having an impact on operating profits?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
So, John, you nailed it in terms of what's going on with operating profit in Q1. It's just the early cost of the ramp of the 14nm server product. That's what's causing that to behave a little differently from revenue. And back to Brian's point, I would say no. There's nothing in the mix that per se would cause me to have a different view of the overall profit potential of this business. So taking networking as the example, it does have a lower ASP than the Xeon product line does. It also has a very different cost structure than the Xeon product line does. So it doesn't cause us to be in a different space from an overall operating profit percent.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
That's helpful. And then maybe for my follow-up to Brian, you guys gave us your view for the PC market this year. I'm just curious, in lieu of the restructuring, how you're thinking about the PC market longer term. And specifically, there's lots going on in the market that you probably can't control, but there's always been this view at Intel that the best use of cash is to invest in the business and to innovate, and innovation drives growth. How do you balance that innovation desire with the realities of PC market? And how do you think about the structural unit growth of PCs going forward? And do we want to risk at some point that PCs just don't provide the scale that you've talked about in the past to invest in other businesses like DCG and IoT?
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. So again, John, that's a bit of a two-sided question. So let me start with the back half and then we'll move into the first half. So first is no, I'm not worried that PC will shrink to a point where the scale will get large enough to fund either the factories or the other innovations. The fact that we talked about the restructuring actually makes us more profitable in the PC. That's allowing us to invest even more in those growth areas. Remember also, those growth areas are growing, and so they are replacing some of the volume in the factories as they grow.
Now, let's talk about the PC. You asked, how do we take a look at the PC long term and how do we make sure we're making the right investments, which to me that's the key. That's what we really tried to do with this restructuring, is take a look at the areas that are growing, that we believe we can bring innovation to, that will make a difference to the end user. You're going to see more investments in 2-in-1s. You're going to see more investments in thin-and-light devices. You're going to see us push even harder on high-end gaming systems, which are growing at a very fast rate, and they tend to buy up the stack to the very, very top. And then we're continuing to gain share in segments like set-top boxes, which are becoming more and more PC-like in their capabilities, if you think about it from a hardware standpoint.
So there are absolutely segments we'll continue to invest and continue to innovate in. There are some very innovative systems in design right now that bring new functionality and new thinness and lightness to the market for the second half of this year. And we'll do that. What we're going to do is make sure we're not doing – that we're doing this as most efficiently, and not doing it spread out across all PCs and all form factors. And that's what we've really tried to do with this effort right now.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks a lot. I think just to start, could you just talk about from a restructuring cost perspective, how much of that is going to be cash versus non-cash? And would all the cash outlays happen in the back half of this year?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
You were a bit faint. I think you asked on the restructuring, how much of that is cash versus non-cash, and how does that play out over the year?
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yes.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yes, now you're loud and clear. Thanks. So I would say the restructuring charge is a mix of cash and non-cash, but it's probably – it's more heavily weighted towards cash costs. And it will be relatively frontend loaded on the year, but some of it will extend over the course of the year, and some of it frankly will extend into the first half of next year.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Perfect. And I guess if I could just follow up, ASPs in the clients were up 19%. Just talk about how much of that was potentially CPE improvements on notebook and desktop pricing versus the lower mobility that may have had a better part to play there?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
And if you look at the CFO commentary, we actually gave you desktop and notebook. What you'll see is that notebook was pretty flat from an ASP standpoint year on year. Desktop was up 6%. So that is one of the adders to profitability.
And then the big difference is what happened in phones and tablets. On a year-on-year basis I think I termed it in the CFO commentary, up significantly as we weaned ourselves out of some of those contra revenue programs that we talked to you about. So that actually had a fairly significant impact on the overall ASP for CCG.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Perfect, thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you for taking my question. Brian, on the Data Center Group, there are a lot of headlines from IBM, from the different ARM server vendors, and even from some of your cloud customers, like Google, who want to try new architectures. And I understand there is no near-term impact, but longer-term, how do you assess the competitive landscape? And especially how do you think it plays out in the compute market, where you are a very large incumbent versus the comms market where you're not the incumbent?
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure, good question, Vivek. First, I'll just tell you that having been raised by Andy Grove, always paranoid about the competition, always driving. And we know that we live or die by the performance of our products. We believe if you take a look at our roadmaps, we have a strong competitive leadership that should allow us to continue to have the position in the market that we currently have.
I think also you have to take a look at some of our strategy that is becoming much, much broader than just the CPU. What we are trying to do is really provide top-of-rack to bottom-of-rack solutions that bring, that work together and bring performance across the whole rack. And that starts with Rack Scale Architecture itself, which is a very unique architecture that will allow people to build racks in a much denser and lower cost way to Silicon Photonics for within rack communication. Then we've got a 3D XPoint, and then you have our whole CPU architecture from networking, storage, up through server.
So we believe we are uniquely positioned to provide that whole rack viewpoint and have everything work together, and come together to bring really performance that is just unbelievable. And that's what's key to really keeping our position is to own that, is to understand that whole rack from top to bottom. And that really is our strategy when you take a look at it.
In the other areas, like you said, networking and storage and the telco area, those are areas that we're gaining share. And we are, as they move to software-defined infrastructure, and basically virtualized infrastructure, it plays right into the Intel architecture and really what we do best, which is general purpose computing. And that same architecture from top of rack to bottom of rack plays out in those areas as well like in the telco area. So we believe our strategy absolutely will maintain our position in that. But we're always paranoid and we're always realizing we get there by performance of those products.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it, thanks for those details. As a follow-up, I know you probably have answered different pieces of this question. But perhaps if, Stacy, you could, help us quantify what Intel's target operating margins are this year or maybe even longer term. Because when I look at a lot of fabless semiconductor companies, they can get towards 20% – 25% operating margins. And when I look at a foundry like TSMC, it's able to get close to 40% operating margin. So given those bookends, where should Intel be after all these restructuring actions are taken?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Let me give you some elements of it. And then I would expect we'll have a much more in-depth conversation on that at the next investor meeting. But I will give you some insight into how Brian and I are thinking of this. First and foremost, we believe there is growth potential here. So just from a top line overall company standpoint, we think that there's significant opportunity to grow. And I think we've executed well in terms of growing over the last couple few years, even as the PC TAM declined, and that's very consistent with our strategy, is invest in the Data Center and Memory and IoT and things like 5G, where we think there's opportunity and focus our investments on the Client that we talked about.
In terms of the overall model and the financial model for the company, I've given you this range of 55% to 65% gross margin as being most of the data points landing between those goalposts. If you look at it over the last five years, we've very consistently been in the very high end of that gross margin range, so a bit more like between 60% and 65%. Last year we were at 63%, this year we believe we're at 62%. So that just continues. I don't see anything on the horizon that changes that in the near term.
And then with these actions that we're taking, when we get to full realization, and I want to stress we do believe that this will give us an opportunity to reinvest in the business and actually accelerate growth. But if you just look at the cost side of it, it's two to three points of spending as a percent of revenue. When we get to mid-2017 and full realization, that takes our spending as a percent of revenue, even just based on your estimate of 2016 revenues of two to three points, it takes it back down into the low 30% from a spending as a percent of revenue, and you can do the math from there and see what we think we can achieve next year in terms of overall operating margin.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely of Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Hey. Thanks, guys, just a quick follow-up on the last question on restructuring. So should we assume that total expenses will drop roughly $150 million a quarter from 4Q 2016 to the second quarter of 2017? And then if you guys could, break that out between how much of the savings would be on COGS versus OpEx.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
So no, I'm not going to give that level of granularity of forecasting by quarter in 2017, but I'll say and I want to be clear that the $1.4 billion is all OpEx. So that's an OpEx savings number that we think we get to by mid-2017. And so just to recap some of the financial data that we've provided you, we get to that level by mid-2017. That's $1.4 billion in savings. That is a net number, so that's including some reinvestment that we plan to make. We think that that's 12,000 positions that get eliminated, which is a very difficult thing for us to go through, but that's what's in these numbers. We think we'll achieve half of those employment reductions by the end of this year.
And overall for 2016, we've brought down our OpEx by $700 million. That is again due to this restructuring program. And we've added in a line that you'll see on the GAAP P&L of $1.2 billion in restructuring charges to achieve that. So beyond that, I'm not going to go into any more granular data. I think that should be plenty, and now we want to go have the conversation with the employees and help them understand what this program means.
Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Yes, very fair response. And as for my follow-up, in terms of the growth opportunities that you guys are really pushing for, IoT, DCG, et cetera, I guess if you look at the margin profile of the Memory and basically cell phone processors, it's substantially below your current margins. So I guess my question is why would you want to pursue two markets like that where the margin profile is so much lower than yours?
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure, so let's dissect those. For Memory, one, we believe that if you take a look at our typical margins, they're better than cell phone margins on typical quarters, but also it's integral to the Data Center. So it really actually is this virtual cycle that especially as we move to 3D NAND and then to 3D XPoint, as we've talked about 3D XPoint and how that really re-architects how Memory and storage is played out in the server rack and in the Data Center overall. It's a chance to really very uniquely shift that whole infrastructure. So we believe that's actually critical to our strategy in the Data Center, and we'll bring a product with good margins.
Now let's talk about IoT. If you take a look at it first, it's growing quite well. And if you take a look at the IoT right now, it grew 22% this quarter, and it has PC-like margins. So this is not cell phone chips. They don't tend to be cell phone chips. If you take a look at the segments we're really going after, which are things like automotive, or what I'll call autonomous vehicles, industrial and retail, they tend to be systems that have a fair amount of compute at the edge. They tend to have machine learning capabilities, and they tend to have a high degree of comms, and more and more will move into 5G.
So that link also between those products in IoT and 5G, and the 5G infrastructure, we believe also plays into the Data Center and the whole Data Center strategy, and will be critical that you can provide end-to-end solutions. So if you're somebody out trying to build whatever that autonomous vehicle is, you need to be able to provide the 5G backend, but also the 5G out on the device, whether it's a car, or a drone, or a robot, or whatever it is out there autonomously moving about.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
And, Chris, let me just, on the margin point, I would take you back to points that Brian and I had made at the Investor Meeting and at other places, which is, remember, and IoT is the perfect example of this. Those businesses lever IP that we create broadly for the company. And so our cost of entry in something like IoT actually is relatively low because we have the Atom core. We have the graphics. We're investing in the connectivity. We're investing in the wireless win for other businesses, and that's where we really get leverage in this model. And that's one of the reasons that the IoT profit margins have been as high as they have been.
Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava of BMO. Your line is now open.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Hi. Thank you very much. Actually I wanted to continue on IoT, Brian. A couple of years ago, you had laid out a 20% CAGR target for this. Then I think a year later, you had brought it down to mid-teens. And yes, it grew very strong this quarter, but last full year it was a 7% grower. So the question is, what's the right way to think about the growth profile for this business? And what happened in the past? Was it a one-year off event or kind of just help us understand the drivers? And why it should re-accelerate? And why the first quarter is not an anomaly? And then I had a quick follow-up.
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. I would tell you that I'd reiterate what I said, which is it's a mid-teen type of growth rate. And you got to take a look at this over the long haul. The IoT space is like similar to the embedded space a little to some extent and to the FPGA space where you have, especially where we're trying to go, where you're trying to go into products that require that higher level of compute, the machine learning and those capabilities. You have a design time, a design-in time to win the design, and then you have a ramp for that product, and so those tend to take a little while.
Autonomous driving vehicles are a good example. If you're out winning designs today, you're winning 2018/2019 car designs. Those are what are being won today. So as you bring your products to market, that's what you're winning. So I'm still believing that over the long-term, this will be a mid-teens growth. It'll have for the most part PC-like margins and we've tried to pick the segments that play to our strengths and that also use the connectivity that we believe we're uniquely qualified to bring.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Okay, thank you. And then my quick follow-up, Stacy, what explains such a big swing in the tax rate for the quarter, for the reported quarter, and then for the rest of the year? Thank you.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Sure. For the reported quarter, the big driver of the tax rate was a discrete item associated with one of the divestitures that we drilled out of our Security business. And we got a one-time tax benefit associated with that. And it's just coming back to the strategy, you can see the performance of the Security business both in terms of the revenue growth and their profit growth. I think the team there is doing a really good job of focusing in on a few key areas where we think we have competitive advantage and then driving them hard. And we've divested a few smaller businesses and then we happened to get a tax benefit on one of them. As we look at the year, so part of it is just what happened in Q1, and then the other part is we would expect to have a higher proportion of our profits in lower tax jurisdictions as we work our way through the year. It will bring down the tax rate a little bit.

Yes, I'm sure that as we go through this and we finish the project evaluations, there will be some products that will exit from those as they're defined. Murthy, who we brought into the company is doing a complete review of all of our products, and he's going to report back to me in the near future and give me a proposal for what those look like. So we don't have any that are set out today, but at the end, I'm sure there are going to be a few that are part of that.
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And related to that, does the restructuring affect your longer-term expectations for technology transitions? And in particular, are you still hoping to get back to a two-year tick-tock cadence?
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
So no, it does not have any effect on our technology cadence. It has not touched that at all. And Stacy talked about even our CapEx and how the CapEx that we're spending this year, which has not moved, is mostly for either the 3D NAND ramp or 10 nm. As far as Moore's Law, we are always constantly striving to get back to two years. We're giving you a timing that's for 10 nm that's more like 2.5 years. We haven't talked about 7 nm, partly it's still in definition and alignment, so we're not sure. But I can truly tell you we are constantly working to get back to two years. And they have tried to lay out, all right, if you look at the history of Moore's Law, there have been anywhere from 18 months to three years in the length of cycles over the time. More importantly, what I always remind people, is the leadership you have over the competition, which is always what's important.
All of these are getting harder and they get hard for everybody. And so you want to make sure also that your leadership gap, what you're able to do relative to the competition, remains constant as well. Both of those are as important as the other.
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Intel Corporation Q4 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Mark Henninger. Please go ahead.
Mark Henninger
Thank you, Sabrina. Welcome everyone to Intel's fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call. By now, you should have received the copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with it. If you have not received both documents, they are available on our Investor website, intc.com.
I am joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO, and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we will hear brief remarks from both of them, followed by the Q&A.
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, does include risk and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.
Also during this call, we will be using non-GAAP financial measures and references. GAAP financial reconciliations are available in earnings material, which was posted on our website, intc.com in advance of this call. The forecast Stacy speaks to today will be on a non-GAAP basis.
With that, let me hand it over to Brian.
Brian Krzanich
Thanks Mark. Our results for the fourth quarter were consistent with expectations. We marked a strong finished to the year. Taken as a whole, 2015 demonstrated the benefits of our strategy, which is designed to capitalize on the growing need for the infrastructure powering the smart and connected world. That strategy is also resulting and the evolution of our business model to focus on three keys areas of growth, the Data Center, the Internet of Things and Memory. Our results reflect that evolution.
Revenue for the year was nearly flat, despite a significant decline in PC demand. 2015 was also a year of revenue record and important milestones and I would like to take a minute to review some of them with you.
Even though the Client Computing Group ended the full year down 8%, we were excited to see that we were able to grow sequentially in the second and third and fourth quarters. As of November, 14 nanometer products made up more than 50% of the Client Computing volume. For the year, high-end Core i7 microprocessors and our K SKUs for gaming, both set all-time volume records, leading to our rich product mix.
In our Security business, we have refocused the organization on endpoint technology, where we enjoy a solid leadership position and we have driven material efficiencies as we fully integrated the McAfee organization into Intel. The results of these changes had been dramatic.
On a constant currency basis, Security revenue rose 6% for the year while the organization's tighter focus drove a remarkable 44% improvement in operating income. The IoT Group grew revenues 7% in 2015 to $2.3 billion, an all-time record as the retail transportation and video segments also strong double-digit year-over-year growth.
In our NAND Solutions group, we introduced a revolutionary new class of memory call 3D XPoint, the industry's first new memory technology in more than two decades. 3D XPoint is a great example of our growth strategy at work, using our technology expertise to innovate and expand into profitably adjacent markets. We think it is a game-changing technology moving forward.
Our confidence in the technology led us to announce in the fourth quarter that we were upgrading our Dalian, China fab to manufacture both 3D NAND and 3D XPoint, with production beginning later this year. For the full-year, our memory business grew more than 20% to $2.6 billion, another all-time record.
At the same time, the Data Center Group grew 11% over last year to an all-time record of $16 billion in revenue. Macro weakness weighed on enterprise demand and resulted in slower growth than we expected at the beginning of the year. However DCG's overall performance highlighted the underlying trends driving data center demand as cloud and communication service providers' revenue, both, grew more than 20% for the year.
Within the Cloud segment, 40% of our volume was custom SKUs as we left the year, demonstrating the ongoing value of working directly with the customers to tailor solutions to their needs.
Finally, just after our fiscal year ended, we closed our acquisition of Altera. We are thrilled to welcome the talented Altera team to Intel. Combined, our two companies will deliver powerful synergies based on Intel's process technology leadership and the integration of Altera's FPGAs.
Wrapping up, our results over the last year leave me increasingly confident in our strategy. While our outlook for the first quarter reflects some caution about overall demand, particularly in China, we continue to expect solid growth in the business in 2016.
Because it provides tremendous return to our shareholders, we will continue to drive innovation and differentiation in our core PC business. This business provides a foundation of IP and a source of cash flow, but it is not the sole driver of our growth.
Our future as a company will increasingly be a product of the virtuous cycle of opportunities in the data center, memory and IoT market segments. In fact, you can see the impact of that virtuous cycle in our 2015 results. DCG, IoTG and Memory, delivered nearly 40% of Intel's revenue and more than 60% of Intel's operating margin in 2015. Additionally, these three adjacent markets delivered $2.2 billion in profitable revenue growth in 2015 alone. As we look ahead to 2016, we will continue to build on that strategy.
With that, let me turn it over Stacy.
Stacy Smith
Thanks, Brian. The fourth quarter was a strong finish to the year, with record revenue a $14.9 billion. We had record revenues in the Data Center and Internet of Things businesses. Gross margin of 64% was up two points to outlook. Net income was $3.6 million, down 1% year-over-year and earnings per share was $0.74, flat over the same horizon.
I would like to provide context behind our full year 2015 financials as it provides insight into how we are executing to our strategy. Growth in the Data Center, Memory and Internet of Things businesses, partially offset a weaker than expected macroeconomic environment and weak PC client market.
Overall, revenue for the year was $55.4 billion, which was down 1% from the prior year. The Client Computing Group achieved $32 billion in revenue and was down 8% for the year. Within the Client Computing Group, we achieved almost $1 billion in mobile profitability improvements over the course of the year, exceeding our goal.
The Data Center business at about $16 billion in revenue grew 11%. The Memory business at over $2.5 billion in revenue grew over 20% and the Internet of Things business at about $2.3 billion, grew 7%.
Gross margin for 2015 was approximately 63%, down about a point from 2014. Higher unit costs as we ramp 40-nanometer were offset by an increase in ASPs, driven by strong results in the data center business and a rich mix in the Client Computing business. Operating profit for the year was $14 billion, down 9% year-on-year, earnings per share for the year was $2.33, up 1% from the prior year.
In 2015, the business continued to generate significant cash with $19 billion of cash from operations. We purchased $7.3 billion in capital assets. We paid $4.6 billion in dividends and repurchased about $3 billion of stock.
Total cash balance was $25.3 billion, up over $11 billion year-over-year. Our net cash balance, total cash less debt, and inclusive of our other longer-term investments was approximately $6.6 billion. We issued about $9.5 billion dollars of new long-term debt to finance our acquisition of Altera.
In November, we announced an $0.08 dividend increase to $1.04 per share on an annual basis effective in the first quarter of 2016. The acquisition of Altera was completed in early fiscal 2016, which means that the 2016 guidance includes the expected results for the FPGA business.
As I talked to our guidance for 2016, it is important to note that we have excluded non-cash and one-time acquisition-related charges for Altera. The CFO commentary pre-released before this call and available on intc.com includes the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations.
For the first quarter of 2016, the mid-point of the revenue range is expected to be $14.1 billion. This forecast, which includes an extra work week and the newly acquired FPGA business, is on the low-end of the average seasonal range. This outlook represents a soft start to the year as we remain cautious on the level of economic growth, particularly in China.
We continue to believe the worldwide PC supply chain is healthy with appropriate levels of inventory. Gross margin for the first quarter is expected to be approximately 62% and spending is expected to be $5.5 billion.
Turning to the full year 2016, we are expecting revenue growth in the mid-to-high single digits relative to 2015. This outlook is higher than our previous guidance provided in November investor meeting. This higher range of driven by the addition of the FPGA business, partially offset by some caution as a result of uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment.
Gross margin for the year is expected to be 63% and spending is expected at $21.3 billion. The capital spending forecast for 2016 is $9.5 billion, up from 2015. As the economic useful life of our manufacturing equipment lengthens, we are extending the depreciable life of equipment in our factories from four to five years. This change in depreciable life drives approximately $1.5 billion and lower depreciation expense for the year. Inclusive of this change, we are forecasting depreciation expense to be $6.5 billion this year, down $1.3 billion from 2015.
Our results demonstrate that we are transforming the company. We are pivoting towards the cloud with a diversified portfolio of businesses. Client is still the largest segment, but the other businesses now make up about 40% of our total revenue and 2015 marked the first year where these businesses made up the majority of our operating profit.
The Data Center business is growing fast and is now a $16 billion business. That growth is being driven by growth rates in cloud computing that were over 40% year-on-year.
Our Memory business grew over 20% year-over-year and is as well positioned to disrupt the industry with the launch of 3D XPoint technology.
Internet of Things business grew in 2015, and is expected to contribute more growth this year. With the Altera acquisition, we expect to broaden our product portfolio in the Data Center and Internet of Things businesses and enable even more innovation.
Most importantly, we are pivoting towards the cloud, diversifying our client business and building a strong foundation for long-term growth for the company.
With that, I will turn it back over to Mark.
Mark Henninger
Alright, thank you Brian and Stacy. Moving on now to the Q&A, as is a normal practice, we would ask each participant ask one question and just one follow-up if you have one. Sabrina, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Joe Moore
Great, Thank you so much. The Client average selling prices went up again for the second quarter is that the same trend you saw in Q3 as stronger high end and what is your assumption for the ASP trajectory going forward?
Brian Krzanich
Sure. I will start, Joe. This is Brian. It is same type of trend we saw throughout 2015, with client buy up the stack and you saw that our record revenue in Core i7 and K SKUs, which are really our top-end SKUs. Forecast for '16 has us relatively flat in this space, so we do not know if it will continue, but right now we forecast flat the ASPs for '16.
Stacy Smith
Just to add, Joe, so there was a client coming. In total we see ASPs up a little bit in '16. You can see it in the gross margin reckon. As Brian said, we are maintaining client ASP, but we are expecting that server becomes a larger percentage of the mix, so we get some mix impact based on what is going on in server.
Joe Moore
Okay. That makes sense. Thanks. My follow-up, the depreciation change, was that something you had known about when you had talked about the full-year guidance at the Analyst Day? What was it that prompted you to make that change now?
Brian Krzanich
Yes. The depreciation change was not included in my forecast that I provided back in November. We were in the middle of the analysis. What prompted it was, we did an in-depth analysis based on the cadence of moving from one process technology node to the next. We talked about that at the beginning of 2015, and the third wave of products and we kind of completed our long range planning in the fourth quarter and that has what triggered the change in the depreciation cadence.
I will also say, just to tie this out for you. In November, I was forecasting a 62% gross margin for the year. I am now projecting a 63% gross margin for the year and the difference there is this change in depreciation, so you can kind of see it in our gross margin reckon.
Joe Moore
Great. Thank you very much.
Brian Krzanich
You are welcome.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Vivek Arya
Thanks for taking my question. First, Brian, you mentioned that there is some uncertainty near-term in the broader environment. I was hoping you could provide us some more color around that if possible by your different segments and perhaps by geography.
Brian Krzanich
Sure, Vivek. It is the same type of trend we saw in 2015, emerging markets slower than the mature markets, U.S., Western Europe looking okay. China and the rest of Asia, slow. It was both, consumer and enterprise. I would say it is a little bit heavier on the client-side, so the PC side than the data center side, but we are seeing some of it on the data center side as well and those are the two big drivers and it is all the same geography.
Vivek Arya
I see. My follow-up maybe for Stacy, can you talk about the leverage in the model? Because, if I take your full year sales growth number, OpEx is roughly about 35-ish percent or so of sales, which is in line with what you had given at Analyst Day, but I am wondering what steps can you take to drive more leverage in the model. As an IDM, shouldn't the goal be to get to at least 30%-plus operating margins, so what steps can you take this year to help drive more leverage in the model? Thank you.
Stacy Smith
Sure. First let me just take a second to detangle the 2016 numbers, because with the extra workweek, the Altera acquisition, which includes some one-time costs and the change in depreciation, it becomes a little hard to, I think, get to the bottom of what's actually happening operationally in the business.
If you recall, in the investor meeting in November, Brian and I talked about the fact that we were looking to reduce spending as a percent of revenue by half-a-point. If you just take all of the adjustments out, so you don't adjust for the change in depreciation we do not adjust for Altera anything like that. We are getting that to half-a-point.
When we add all of that in, we are getting a bit more than the half-a-point improvement from 2015 to 2016 in terms of our projections, so we feel we are delivering what we committed to, and when you put some of these adjustments on top of it, we will deliver a little bit more.
In terms of the opportunities there, we articulated and I will let Brian comment over the top, but we articulated in the investor meeting we are still committed to drive spending as a percent of revenue down. We are in the midst of transformation right now, so we are going through a period where we are reading and feeding our portfolio, we are making some disinvestments, but very importantly we are investing in areas that we think are critical for long-term growth and health of the company and where we get lots of return i.e., the Data Center, the Internet of Things or process technology leadership, the Memory business, so we knew going into this year it would be a time of elevated investment, we are delivering what we committed, but there is more to come in future years. Thanks, Vivek.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from line of C.J. Muse of Evercore. Your line is now open.
C.J. Muse
Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess now with the Altera deal closed, I was curious if you could provide an update on your server chip roadmap and strategy as we look into 2016 and beyond.
Brian Krzanich
Sure, C.J. This is Brian. Let me just kind of give you a broad picture of Altera and where we are at. As you said, we just closed. We have just gotten through employee integration, everybody has got a badge, if you just go by the sign is out in front Intel now, we are really excited, we are starting to dig into some of the product roadmaps.
The good news is, we had been working as separate companies on the first of the server chips, which is a multi-chip package, so FPGA and our Xeon in the same package. That will actually start sampling to select customers in the first quarter of this year and it will continue to select - in limited quantities - it will continue to sample throughout this year, with production in '17.
Our roadmap will then - we are still working on our roadmap beyond that of when do we integrate the full IP into our silicon, so basically monolithic die and we are now actually spending an equal amount of time on that same kind of a roadmap in MCP or multi-chip package filed by monolithic die in the IoT space, so we feel pretty good about the progress and we are already in the first quarter going to be set going to the kind of leading edge [ph] if you think about.
C.J. Muse
Very helpful, and I guess as my follow-up, you provided a $10 billion CapEx budget and now it looks like it is about $500 million lower at the mid-point. I was curious what has changed there. Is that principally capacity on the logic side as opposed to memory given what we are seeing in the macro environment? Thank you.
Brian Krzanich
Yes. It is all logic for the most part and it is not as much a macro versus testing capacity or anything. That is just the ins and outs. As we went from the investor meeting into the actual firm forecast for 2016, the team has just sharpened down all the numbers and went through it in more detail.
I do not think there is anything more to it. I will let Stacy comment if he wants to give you any other light on this one.
Stacy Smith
No.
C.J. Muse
Great. Thanks so much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Harlan Sur
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On the Data Center business, it decelerated as the team has expected, but 5% year-over-year growth in Q4 was a bit more deceleration than what we were anticipating, so I guess two questions. Was it all enterprise that drove the weakness and do you expect to get back to a double-digits growth trajectory in the March quarter and is the team still confident about driving mid-teens growth for DCG in 2016?
Brian Krzanich
Yes. There are a couple of things I want to talk about on the Data Center. First, when you compare Q4 to Q4, we you are looking at comparative where Q4 '14 was one of our strongest quarters, you know, as long as I can remember very strong - greater than 20% growth for the quarter, so that quarter was a little bit of unique so the quarter-to-quarter comparative is a bit tough.
If you take a look at how the second half it is really Q3 and Q4 kind of looked similar. Enterprise actually stabilized from the first half, so enterprise was weak in the first half and it has got a little bit more stable in the second half. What we saw was the normal, the cloud guys turned the slowdown in the fourth quarter, because that is when a lot of that cloud, you know, they do not want to be upsetting the cloud infrastructure while the holiday seasons are on people are buying things then we continued to see strong growth and strong share gain in the networking in Telco side.
Absolutely, we continue to look out. Again, we are very careful to not look at is this on a quarter-by-quarter basis. We are looking at the long view and we are very confident that yes we will continue into this double-digit growth in the Data Center. It will continue to be fueled by the cloud in the first side and then secondly by our growth in Telco and networking as our share grows there. Remember, we entered the year less than 10% share of that space and there is a lot of space there for us to grow in the networking and Telco space.
Stacy Smith
Let me just add one thing to the premise of your question. I think we were not surprised by where we ended up in the Data Center. If you recall back in November, we talked about Data Center growth rate for the year being in the low double digits. That is exactly where we came in.
Based on what Brian was just talking about in terms of the strength of Q4 '14, we were expecting this to be a tough compare that we would have growth rates in the single digits.
Harlan Sur
Great. Thanks for the insights there. Then for my follow-up, you know, the team is going to be launching its 6th generation V Core product line for enterprise desktop PCs, I think, next week. There also has not been a refresh of desktop for two years, so I guess the question is what are you hearing from your corporate and enterprise customers as to the potential uptake of these new platforms relative to the very muted enterprise demand profile that we had last year?
Brian Krzanich
As you said, we kind of went roughly a year or so without a desktop enterprise upgrade, and especially when you combine coming back now with the refresh, that refresh being Skylake, the combination of Skylake's great performance and great graphics. We are past the Windows 10 launch, which is another positive in this space.
We are hearing very good response as far as people's interest, the form factors you are seeing, right? You are seeing All-in-Ones, you are seeing classic desktop platforms, you are seeing great graphics, you are seeing OLED displays. Overall, it is just another segment, where we think the best computing device really is the computing industry has every built are going to be showcased.
The excitement there and we just got to get past the macroeconomics of enterprises saying we are going to go do the upgrade.
Harlan Sur
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.
Stacy Rasgon
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I wanted to go to the equipment life extension. I know you were hopeful that eventually you would be able to get your node migration trajectory back from three years to two, so this sounds like a fairly permanent change in terms of extending your equipment life time, so what should we take from this action in terms of how you view the potential improvement ability of your node migration trajectory going forward?
Brian Krzanich
It is not an impact at all, Stacy. This is whether we are at two years or two-and-a-half or three, it was not going to dramatically shift that life expectancy like this. This is more about the amount of reuse and the efficiency and speed at which we can do the conversion, so both of those numbers have improved.
Now the cycle, clearly it does not hurt to have from this perspective, the longer node cycle, but independent of that, this is a change that was fundamental to the shift and reuse and rate at which we are able to move tool from being able to run, say, 14 nanometers to 10 nanometers.
Stacy Smith
I would also just add. That is exactly right. The reuse is something that has been shifting over time and it gives us a lot of economic benefit. I will give you the accounting answer here too, which is if we got to 7 nanometer or 5 nanometer and there was something that caused us to look at the depreciable life, the economic usefulness of the equipment, we would change it, but we are certainly not expecting anything like that, but as we go through this analysis every year.
Brian Krzanich
Only thing I would add to finish is, within the manufacturing side, one of our objectives is to continue to improve on those vectors that I talked about, reuse and speed at which we are able to do these transitions, so we will be constantly trying to get this to be a longer and longer number if possible, independent of the nodes, because it just shows we are becoming more efficient.
Stacy Smith
Right.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. Thank you, guys. For my follow-up, I just wanted to take a look at the extra week that is in Q4. How much of your guidance is actually coming from that extra week. Is it sort of the full, I guess the 7.5% of whatever it is or is less, because that week is happening at the end of '15 and beginning of '16? How should we think about how that may influence normal seasonality into Q2?
Brian Krzanich
Yes. Sorry. Maybe I did not hear you, and just I want to clarify that the extra work week is in Q1 of 2016, not Q4 2015.
Stacy Rasgon
Yes, but I think it is like December 28th through January 4th or something, so how did that.
Brian Krzanich
…earlier than that. The background on this is, we go through this every five years to seven years, because we are on a work week calendar over five-year to seven-year period. We get out of sync with the actual calendar and then we add in a workweek in order to get back on sync.
It is easy actually to quantify the spending associated with that extra workweek, because, you know, we have got lights on and factories running and we are paying people, so revenue associated with it is a little harder to calculate.
When you look at where the week actually falls, it is that week between Christmas and New Year's. Our fiscal year ended, I think, the day after Christmas, so it is that week between Christmas and New Year's that tends to be a billings week that is dramatically lower than any other week we see during the year, so some revenue impact kind of hard to quantify it.
The way I would look at it though, you know, when you look at our guide and you take out Altera and you take into account any impact for the extra workweek, what you would see is that the guide for the first quarter is, you know, kind of at the low-end of what we normally see from a Q4 to Q1, is how I think of it and then you add Altera back on top of that and you get to the revenue number that we provided.
Just to be totally transparent, the revenue number for Altera in Q1 is on the order of $400 million, so you can kind of do the math from there. Thanks Stacy.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. Thank you, guys.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
John Pitzer
Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Brian, the first question I have is on the DCG business. This quarter, the December quarter, you saw a modest drop in ASPs both, sequentially and year-over-year, which is somewhat of anomaly for that business. I guess I understand the mix shift as cloud grows faster than enterprise. I am kind of curious; do you think this was a one-quarter anomaly? Is this something we should expect more of as networking grows faster in '16? Within the individual segments, are you still seeing customers buy up the stack?
Brian Krzanich
Okay. That is actually a great question, John. For Q4, the decline or the decrease in ASP was mostly driven by the much higher growth rate in the networking as you mentioned and the fact that the percentage of out add-on [ph] in networking tends to be a bit higher, so if you look at networking as a whole, the ASPs in networking tend to be lower than, say, cloud or enterprise.
However, if you look at Q4's networking ASP, so if you took out just that ASP and you compared that ASP relative to prior quarters, it was actually up as an average, selling at a lower average selling price, but that average selling price is increasing as more people buy - and as NFV and SDNs takeoff, more people tend to buy up to core, because they are really searching for that performance.
We do hope and expect this trend to continue into '16 as we gain share in networking, the relative strength. Then if you take a look at the cloud space and the enterprise space, we expect those to continue on the trends you have seen over the last few years. We do not expect any major shift there, but we have very strategic plans to continue to grow in the networking, storage and especially around the Telco and networking space as SDN and NFV really take hold.
You will see a slightly lower ASP from there, but we expect the ASP to continue to increase in that space as we bring more functionality. Does that answer your question?
John Pitzer
Yes. It does. Very helpful, then Stacy, as my follow-on, you raised sort of the full-year gross margin by about 100 basis points, but if I kind of do the math $1.5 billion decrease in depreciation on a $60 billion revenue stream is more than 100 basis points. In addition, the Altera gross margin was higher than your core, so I guess I am trying to understand what are the offsets? Is 10 nanometer cost kind of coming in higher than expected and if you could help us understand sort of the progression of 10 nanometer cost throughout the year? That would be helpful.
Stacy Smith
Sure, and a great question. I know there is a lot of moving parts here. Let me just focus in on the depreciation change for second. I actually try to be very transparent. In the CFO commentary that was released, you will see some of this written out, so you can always refer back to it.
The change in depreciation, you are right. In total, it was about $1.5 billion, but only about half of that is flowing through COGs impacting gross margins in 2016 and that is why you get to the kind of one-point shift, and that really is the primary difference, so there is a few other moving parts, but nothing that is material. That is the thing that changed from 62% gross margin forecast that we had in November to 63% gross margin forecast that we have today.
The rest of the change in depreciation, about a quarter that will flow through OpEx, because remember all of the spending we do for research and development facilities actually flows through our research and development lines, so you see a little bit of a benefit there. Then you have some of it that goes into inventory and then ships out over time.
John Pitzer
Thank you.
Brian Krzanich
You are welcome.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely of Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Chris Danely
Thanks, guys. Just another question on the weakness you are seeing. Can you just maybe going into some detail on, when it started, have you seen any stability? Is this just CPUs in your full-year forecast you are implying that we get back to normal seasonality in Q2 through Q4?
Stacy Smith
Yes. I would articulate, we have a cautious stance as we start the year. There were a couple of things that feed into that. Units were a little weaker for us in the Client segment and Q4. As we worked our way through the Christmas selling season, what we saw was the sell-through all the way to the end customer was a less than we thought. We made up for that with a rich mix, so that is why we ended up with a pretty good result, but a little - we are watching that carefully.
Then our team on the ground in China has gotten fairly cautious about what is going on in China right now. As you know, that is the largest PC market, so we are just little cautious on the growth rates there.
In terms of from here, I think Brian said it well, we are expecting this is the environment as we work our way through 2016, against the a backdrop of somewhat weak macroeconomic environment we kind of expect the year to play out kind of normally from here.
Chris Danely
Okay. Thanks. Then as far as the Altera revenue, I think you said $400 million. I think that is down like somewhere in the mid-teens or something like that, sequentially. Why the conservative forecast. Then do you have any forecast for the year for Altera business?
Brian Krzanich
Yes. I am not going to speak. They did not release results for 2015, so I am really not able to talk about their results for 2015. I can tell you from our perspective, we did not see anything that was surprising in terms of what we have seen about their business levels. We actually expect some revenue growth as we go from '15 to '16.
I will give you kind of in total what we expect for Altera. It is a little north of $1.6 billion in terms of revenue. Gross margin that as John was saying is a little higher than the corporate average, so it gives us a slight mix, but because it is a relatively small business against the backdrop of Intel, it is not a big shift in our gross margin and then we were expecting spending that is at run rate of a of $200 million a quarter.
In addition to all of that, there will be a bunch of kind of one-time acquisition deal related, there is amortization acquisition related intangibles, we see all those in the GAAP number. I have excluded them from the non-GAAP numbers I just gave you.
Chris Danely
Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Ross Seymore
Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask you questions. Stacy, one question on the OpEx side, back to that leverage question, you had a very useful slide at the Analyst Meeting about how you disinvest in some areas and increase investments in another.
I guess my next question is, given that ability to do a substitution in the past, is there any limitation on that going forward or if you going to keep spending more on some of the growth initiatives. Is that actually going to be all incremental to the level we have now?
Stacy Smith
No. I think that is actually part of our DNA. As we are pretty rigorous about trying to weed and feed where we invest and where we disinvest. As you referred to in the Investor Meeting, I showed up and down arrow chart and the magnitude of those shifts was on the order of a $1 billion for some of the big movers as we added investments in some areas and subtracted investments in others and I will also say there is a point at which we expect that we get more and more leverage in businesses like the Data Centers as well, so I think there is a lot of opportunities for us to bring down spending as a percent of revenues as we go forward.
Ross Seymore
I guess my final…
Stacy Smith
Add anything to that.
Brian Krzanich
No. Go ahead.
Ross Seymore
I guess as my follow-up question is, just any more color you can provide on the channel inventory? You mentioned that the unit demand was a little weaker than you had expected. How is the channel looking right now and what sort of expectation should we have for your internal inventory looking into this year? Thanks.
Brian Krzanich
Sure. We believe that 2015 ended with I would just call it very healthy inventories. In fact, one of the things we saw was a slight decrease in the inventory levels as we exited the fourth quarter. If you take a look at what we had originally projected and what would have been more an industry norm would have been a slight increase in inventory. We expect those kind of healthy inventory levels to extend through '16. There is no sign that anybody is adding inventory or not moving of a cautious position on inventory and that is what has been built into our forecast as well.
Stacy Smith
Yes. To the question on internal inventory levels, I would just say, we ended Q4 with a little more inventory than I was expecting and a little higher than I would like. Two drivers there, we saw as I said a little bit weaker units, so we made up for us in rich mix, a little bit weaker unit and we saw yields get better on 14 nanometer and the combination of that - little more inventory leaving Q4 than I would like.
You will see it, on a dollar basis, will go up in Q1 as a result of Altera, so Altera will cause the inventory levels to go up some, but when you look at it from a business standpoint, I think we will work through the inventory we have, and when we get into the back half of the year, we will bring inventory levels down.
Ross Seymore
Great. Thank you.
Stacy Smith
Welcome.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis of Barclays. Your line is now open.
Blayne Curtis
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Stacy, the roughly $400 million of Altera, I do not expect you to report it going forward. Just curious how does that fit into reportable buckets just kind of levels that if the first quarter out.
Then secondly, could you just talk about how you are integrating or not integrating Altera. I think I have kind of heard both. It sounds like you wanted to keep the sales force separate, but just curious, kind of, where does that report under and how much integration are you going to do?
Stacy Smith
Sure. I will take the accounting question. Then I will ask Brian to give his insight and philosophy on the whole integration.
On the reportable segment, so actually I do plan to give you full visibility into Altera. It is a relatively small business for us. It does not hit the SEC reporting requirement, so it does not come across that threshold, but we just feel strongly that based on transparency and the size of the acquisition, we want to give you transparency, so you will see that in our financials going forward.
I will let Brian answer the integration question.
Brian Krzanich
Yes. From an integration standpoint, I think what you have seen we have done with McAfee as we have integrated it into Intel Security and you saw the great results that we have shown in the fourth quarter, those are somewhat an example of what happens as you integrate and you really get to focus on the business at a much higher level.
Same thing for Altera, we plan to fully integrate it. It is going to look like a business group, no different than say CCG that has PCs and modems, phones or DCG that has Data Center. It is called PSG, Programmable Solutions Group. It reports directly to me and it will be fully integrated.
The sales force at the beginning, because the sales tend to be a bit more technical and a bit more a field sales engineering-type role, we are keeping it separate, but that is something we are going to continue to evaluate, but the organization, the engineering, already were in the first two weeks. We had - really for me, I am really pleased with the level of integration and help that we have done to get products and the roadmaps focused and integrated into our internal systems, so you should expect it to be fully integrated.
Stacy Smith
Thanks, Blayne. Operator, I think we have time for two more questions.
Operator
Perfect. Our next question comes from the line of David Wong of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
David Wong
Thanks very much. What might we expect in the way or new 14 nanometer Data Center processors family in 2016?
Brian Krzanich
Let see. I think, we have got Broadwells, Xeon. It is going to launch in the first half here of '16, so that will be the first of the 14 nanometer or the next 14 nanometer into 2016, is that E5 on Broadwell. The rest of them, we have not put any other dates out there yet, so Skylake SKUs and so forth.
David Wong
Okay. Great. My follow-up, with startup and other charges, do you expect memory output in China in 2016 will be a positive or negative contribution to EPS and should we expect a positive contribution in 2017 from the China fab?
Stacy Smith
Let me think. There will be some pretty significant costs and that is in the gross margin reckon associated with the startup of the factory in China. We will be in production in the back half of the year, but we are just ramping production. I think if you were just looking at the six-month time period, you would say it is kind of negative and you can see it in the gross margin it is a slight negative on the gross margin.
It does not change the fact that we make these investments and then we get this, what I would say tremendous long-term benefit out of making that investments, so that does not - I do not want you to take from that that we are somehow less bullish on the transformational capabilities of what the team has managed to pull off for 3D XPoint, because we are actually quite bullish on that.
David Wong
Great. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.
Timothy Arcuri
Thanks a lot. I just had a question again on the depreciation change. I know, Stacy, you talked about it being due to reuse, but I guess relative to just the fundamental cadence of the migrations, your intent has been to get sort of back on a normal Morris low cadence. I just want to make sure that is still the case?
Brian Krzanich
Yes. We have said that - This is Brian, by the way, not Stacy. 10 nanometers would be closer to that two-and-a-half years than two years that we would continue to strive to get back on two years. Some of that was as we go to the fine 7 nanometers, what the complexity technology looks like, whether UV is ready or not, but absolutely we are pushing to get back on that two-year cadence.
Stacy Smith
Yes. I would just add, please do not take the accounting of the depreciable life to be somehow signal that we are letting our foot off the gas on process technology cadence and process technology leadership. That is the heartbeat of the company and we are driving it hard. The accounting just as looking at how long that equipment is economically viable in our factories and it is pretty clearly five years as we go forward.
Timothy Arcuri
Right. Okay. Got it. Then just last question, so on the mobile group, at the Investor Day you talked about another $800 million improvement this year in the losses. Is this still the target and maybe talk about the progress there and whether we could see any momentum for smartphone this year with 7360? Thanks a lot.
Brian Krzanich
It is absolutely still the target. That has not changed one bit. It is a little early in the year to talk about progress. I would tell you that we have a large percentage of $800 million, already I will call it planned out.
In other words, we have projects. We know what we need to do, introduce products, align which SKUs are coming and move products on to that, so I would say a large percentage of that is well-planned through the year, but it is throughout the year, so I cannot tell I have already get $200 million of it or something like that, not here in the second, third week of the year.
7360, it is out. It is sampling, the customers are going through their validations now at the systems, where they are building up systems and out testing them on networks and so forth. As far as the launches of those systems and the announcements, those are always up to our customers and we do not make sure that we are the ones announcing that.
Then what we have told you is that, what is even as important is that we are on a yearly cadence now of our modem technology and we are very confident on that as well for the next set of modems that comes out after the 7360.
Stacy Smith
Thanks, Tim. All right, thank you all for joining us today. Sabrina, you can please go ahead and wrap up the call.

Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Intel Corporation Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Mark Henninger, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Mark Henninger
Thank you, Amanda, and welcome everyone to Intel's third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. By now you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with it. If you've not received both documents, they're available on our Investor website, intc.com.
I'm joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO; and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them, followed by Q&A.
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, does include risk and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.
Also, if during this call we use any non-GAAP financial measures or references, we'll post the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliation to our web site, intc.com.
And finally, I'd like to remind everyone that we will be hosting our annual investor meeting here at our Santa Clara headquarters on Thursday, November 19. If you have questions about the event or logistics, please contact investor relations.
With that, let me hand it over to Brian.
Brian Krzanich
Thanks Mark. We executed well against our strategy in the third quarter, and delivered revenue just above the midpoint of our expectations; as a result of a richer client mix, driven largely by our new 6th Gen core products.
Despite ongoing macroeconomic headwinds, there are signs that the PC market is beginning to stabilize and we continue to benefit from a strategy designed to capitalize on the growing need for the infrastructure that powers the smart and connected world.
I'd like to take a moment to touch on a few highlights; the client confidence [ph] on these products and good, better, best segmentation strategy to record core mix. The third quarter saw the release of both Windows 10 and our 6th Generation core microprocessors, formerly known as Skylake. Our partners in the industry are using this combination to drive an unprecedented innovation, creating new generation of high performance enthusiast desktops and thinner, lighter and more versatile two-in-ones. There are more than 50 sixth generation core systems in the market, available and shipping now, and we expect to more than triple that number by the end of 2015.
We remain solidly on track to our previously committed goal to improve mobile profitability by $800 million. Over 75% of that goal has already been realized to-date. At the same time, our strategy to be a foundational supplier of internet infrastructure is delivering growth. Our Data Center, non-volatile memory and IOT groups all posted double digit growth year-over-year.
BCG grew 12% on strong cloud and networking volume. At the same time, the Internet of Things grew 10% year-over-year, driven by the video, manufacturing and retail segments.
The Altera transaction remains on-track to our original six to nine month closing schedule. During the quarter, both U.S. regulators and Altera stockholders approved the transaction. We are excited about the new opportunities and innovations that integrated FPGAs will make possible, in both the Data Center and the Internet of Things.
In the third quarter, the strength in our memory business continued, growing 20% year-over-year. We are excited about our 3D XPoint technology, the industry's first new memory category in more than two decades. This breakthrough technology is up to 1,000 times faster than NAND and up to 10 times denser than conventional memories, like DRAMs. This enables memory intensive applications to be performed at much faster rates and much lower costs, opening up entirely new opportunities.
3D XPoint is evidence of our commitment to innovation, and it’s a direct result of our 10 plus year research and development pipeline. While we have more work to do, together, these results reinforce my confidence in our strategy, to create shareholder value. I look forward to talking with you more about our opportunities and our plans during our November investor meeting.
And with that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.
Stacy Smith
Thanks Brian. Revenue for the third quarter was $14.5 billion, 10% growth quarter-on-quarter and above the midpoint of our outlook. The higher than expected revenue, was driven by higher notebook and desktop platform average selling prices, as we shipped a record core mix. Year-on-year revenue was flat.
Third quarter gross margin of 63% was in line with the outlook. Operating income of $4.2 billion was down 8% year-over-year and up 45% quarter-over-quarter. Net income was $3.1 billion, down 6% year-over-year and up 15% quarter-over-quarter, and earnings per share of $0.64 was down 3% year-over-year and up 16% quarter-over-quarter.
The Client Computing Group had revenue of $8.5 billion, a 7% decrease year-over-year. From a PC market perspective, we continue to see weakness in nine consumer segments in emerging markets.
The worldwide PC supply chain is healthy, as we ramp our sixth generation core microprocessors, formerly known as Skylake. Operating profit for the overall Client Computing Group was $2.4 billion, down 20% year-over-year. The Data Center, Internet of Things and Memory businesses continue to account for almost 40% of our revenue in the third quarter. The Data Center Group had record revenue of $4.1 billion. The 12% growth year-over-year is driven by strength in the cloud and improvement in our enterprise business. The Data Center Group had operating profit of $2.1 billion, up 9% year-over-year. The Internet of Things segment also achieved 10% year-over-year revenue growth of $581 million.
Additionally, the memory business grew at 20%. The business continued to generate significant cash, with $5.7 billion of cash from operations in the third quarter. We purchased $1.2 billion in capital assets, paid $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchased $1 billion of stock in the third quarter. Total cash balance at the end of the quarter was $20.8 billion, up $7 billion quarter-over-quarter. Our net cash balance, total cash less debt, and inclusive of our other longer term investments, is approximately $5.1 billion. Over the next two quarters, we expect to complete the acquisition of Altera. During the third quarter, we issued $8 billion of new long term debt, consistent with financing plan I outlined on the last earnings call.
As we look forward to the fourth quarter of 2015, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $14.8 billion, up 2% from the third quarter, and we are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range to be 62%, a one point decrease from the third quarter. This revenue forecast, aligns with our prior full year 2015 revenue guidance of down approximately 1% when compared to 2014.
Overall, we are seeing a weak PC client business being offset by strong growth in the Data Center, memory and Internet of Things businesses. For the full year 2015, we expect the memory business to grow at a fast pace. Both the Data Center and Internet of Things businesses will also exhibit strong growth. But the annual growth rate for these businesses will be lower than expectations at the beginning of the year, as a result of weaker than expected macroeconomic growth.
We now expect the Data Center business to grow in the low double digits versus the prior forecast of approximately 15%. Relative to our forecast at the beginning of the year, we are seeing a weaker enterprise segment being partially offset by a stronger than expected cloud segment.
The third quarter results and the fourth quarter forecast reinforce our strategy. Despite weakness in the macroeconomic environment and the overall PC market, we are achieving solid financial results as we benefit from the growth in Data Center, memory, and Internet of Things businesses. More importantly, we are building the foundation for future growth. The combination of the 6th Generation core microprocessor and Windows 10 creates exciting devices for the PC segment. Our investments and leadership in the Data Center are resulting in strong growth. We have a strong and growing memory business, which is well positioned to disrupt the industry with a launch of 3D XPoint technology, and lastly, we are well positioned to benefit in the Internet of Things market.
Our process technology leadership and a broad range of leadership IP creates a competitive advantage that we believe will result in increased shareholder value, and as we complete the Altera acquisition, we expect to broaden our product portfolio and enable even more innovation.
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.
Mark Henninger
Okay. Thank you Brian and Stacy. Moving on now to the Q&A; as is our normal practice, we would ask each participant to ask one question and just one follow-up, if you have one. Amanda, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Chris Danely of Citigroup. Your line is open.
Chris Danely
Hey, thanks guys. I guess just to kind of go over the revenue beat; so it sounds like, to paraphrase, it was mostly driven by -- or all driven by CCG and that it was mostly driven by pricing, is that true? And then why wouldn't -- gross margins haven't been a little better than expected, if pricing was so strong, or if you could just illustrate [ph]on that?
Stacy Smith
Yes. The first approximation, the revenue higher than expectations was a result of a richer mix inside of the client group. You can see that the unit and ASP trends in the supplemental materials that I put out. But pretty much to our expectations, it was all due to just a richer mix. We saw strength at the core i7 level literally across the core product line, as we launched Skylake.
The gross margin question, if you look at the margin recon, what we saw is we saw some good news associated with the richer mix. It was offset by higher 14-nanometer costs than we were anticipating. We are expecting some bad news. We had a little bit more bad news than we anticipated, and that comes down till we actually ramped the Ireland factory a little bit earlier and the first wafers out of that factory were pretty expensive, and so we saw a mixing up of costs in Q3 a little bit more than we thought.
Chris Danely
Okay, thanks. And for my follow-up, you mentioned some demand going on out there, some demand changes in the geos and everybody is concerned about China. Can you just comment on your business in China, and maybe just talk about how your geos did in general versus expectations?
Brian Krzanich
Sure. This is Brian. I think if you take a look at -- there has been a trend this entire year, where the mature markets have tended to do -- be the strongest for us, so U.S., western Europe. And Asia, PRC, parts of Eastern Europe, developing countries not being as strong, they are having some softness that carried into the third quarter as well. And so, if you just take a look at China in general, it kind of mimics that and -- if you look at it, sales are down slightly, they are softer, and its more of the consumer than the enterprise in that space, and across all the different segments. We saw it across the board.
Chris Danely
Okay. Thanks guys.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Ross Seymore
Hi guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. I got a follow-up on the ASP side of things. Stacy, could you give us a little color underneath the covers on how the CCG ASPs can be up 15% year-over-year when the desktop and notebook breakdowns are up at most like half or a third of that? And then, how sustainable is that ASP increase going forward, as I notice you did not put it into your gross margin benefit in the fourth quarter?
Stacy Smith
Yeah. So on to your first question, the piece of the math you're missing is, what's going on tablets. And while it’s a relatively small portion of the business, if you remember, a year ago, we were seeing very significant counter revenue dollars which was coming out of ASP, and those for the large part, have abated. And so a change in the tablets is giving you that average that's higher than both desktop and notebook.
We provided the data. If you just look at desktop, the ASP is up about 8% year-on-year and notebook ASP is up about 4% year-on-year, and that's really just mix. I am not sure if it’s the second part of your question?
Ross Seymore
Just that the sustainability and what it would do to gross margin? You didn't mention it in the fourth quarter, as far as being an ASP benefit?
Stacy Smith
Yeah. We are shipping a rich mix, that has been true across 2015, if you just see -- against the backdrop of a relatively weak PC market. We have seen pockets of strength and a lot of that has been at the high end. And I think its coming down -- we have got some great technology there, we are doing a reasonably good job of segmenting the product lines, so its not one size fits all anymore, you have all in ones and gaming PCs. We have launched a specific line now for gamers, those kinds of things. I think its likely to stay a fairly rich mix. So that's not -- gross margin, we kind of -- this means we are expecting it to maintain, not necessarily grow from here, but also, not necessarily come down.
Ross Seymore
Great. And I guess, as my follow-up, looking at your MCG, which you used to call the MCG side, and more specifically, the cellular side, you have had another reasonably large player exit that market during this last quarter in Marvell. Can you just give us an update on where you are with your LTE and maybe SoFIA product lines, and strategically, have you noticed any change in that business, now that the number of suppliers at the high end seems to be down to two?
Brian Krzanich
Yeah. So I think, let me start with the first part of your question, which is how is the progress going inside. So we have our 7260 modem that's been shipping throughout this year. There are products throughout the world that are using that modem, including in the U.S. The 7360, which is our next generation modem, is -- we will be shipping by the end of this year, with products to be announced by our customers, next year. So the LTE modem ramp, basically you need to be on a -- yearly cadence with these modems is going well. SoFIA 3G and the 3G-R, which is the Rockchip version of the SoFIA is in market today, that you can see tablets and phones with those today. You will see the first of the SoFIA LTEs next year, first half of next year, and SoFIA with Intel 14-nanometer in the back half of next year, and so those continue on schedule as well.
And market dynamics, I guess the way I look at the modem business is, its not really dependent -- it’s a competitive market, and its not as much about how many players are in it. There is actually I think more than two. But its really about keeping that yearly cadence and having the right technologies in place and being competitive, and it doesn't really matter almost how many there are, there will be somebody there trying to compete with you at that leading edge. That's where the modem is really driven at that leading edge.
Ross Seymore
Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein. Your line is open.
Stacy Rasgon
Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, can you tell us what drove the CapEx this quarter and what that implies for how you're viewing sort of forward unit trajectory, as we exit the year?
Stacy Smith
Sure. Actually, it’s a pretty specific issue this quarter. We upgraded the configuration of a specific piece of equipment that we were going to buy [indiscernible] some delivery slots that were towards the end of this year. As we upgraded to a richer configuration, it swapped out to delivery slots from the end of this year, to Q1 of next year. So just shifted a few hundred million dollars worth of CapEx from 2015 to 2016.
In terms of outlook for next year, we are not providing that forecast now. We will talk obviously a lot more about that in November. You do have to keep in mind, this was an unusually low year, so I'd expect directionally, CapEx will be up some next year, but we will talk much more about that in November.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. Thank you. So my follow-up, I just want to clarify, so you're essentially holding your Q4 revenue guidance, effectively unchanged versus what was implied before? We have got Data Center, which is basically lower. PC outlook is still weak, and it seems like the unit outlook there, maybe lower than it was. Your cap is cut again, suggest you don't see the unit trend improving. Is it fair to say then that really the pricing outlook is really all that's kind of helping you support the outlook into Q4? And I guess you sort of talked about a little bit on sustainability of that, as you see it. But I guess, would you to find sort of I guess the outlook on pricing now to be the biggest near term risk on beyond just -- with the channel doing great? I guess, was pricing the biggest near term risk, in terms of what's driving the business, if we are looking over the next couple of quarters, as we exit the year?
Brian Krzanich
So let me start with this, and then I am sure, Stacy is going to have something to add. I think first, in our comment that we are not -- given the CapEx shift, we are not thinking about units growing. Anything we spend in CapEx today is really about capacity, probably more towards the end of next year, maybe even into 2017. So you have to remember, there is this lag, and that's why, as we looked at the tool, actually, we are making an adjustment on the efficiency of that tool, basically the number of units per tool out. In order to get more capacity, when that tool is really required. So I want to just separate that, so people don't get the wrong message about the CapEx and what we will do in the future.
If you take a look at Q4, we said whilst it's absolutely relatively a seasonal, when you just take a look at the unit level standpoint. So there is a natural decline in the total number of units, as you go from Q3 into Q4, based on just holiday shift.
Now we are going to move -- if you take a look at Q4 versus Q3, there is a higher percentage of Skylake, which is our 6th Generation core as we talked about, and we think there will be a richer mix, as you move into there. So that's kind of how Q4 was laid out, and then as we said, we are not really talking about 2016 yet until the investor meeting. But I think we should separate out the CapEx, we have predicted -- the key -- seasonal Q4, but with a mix that is remaining rich, but that richness is based on both the great products that we have been producing, but also a richer percentage of Skylake/Intel 6th Gen Core.
Stacy Smith
I guess, I'd just add. I would just zoom out a little bit on the math. We exited Q3 with healthy worldwide supply chain inventories. We actually think we probably undershipped the market a little bit in Q3, and we are forecasting seasonal Q4, and there was a little bit of movement into the businesses, but nothing that really moves the numbers. So to us, it feels like a pretty natural forecast in support of all the data we have seen.
Brian Krzanich
Thanks Stacy.
Stacy Rasgon
Thank you guys.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
John Pitzer
Yeah. Good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Stacy, maybe just a follow-up on the September quarter; you said in your prepared comments that platform for client was up about 3% on a volume basis. Can you help me better understand what desktops and notebooks did sequentially, because if I kind of rack the year-over-years, I am getting up high single digit to low double digit sequentially; is that right? And then just relative to your comment about -- earlier about inventory, how does that [indiscernible] sort of a lean inventory, or do you actually feel like Skylake is producing a build or will continue to produce a build into the calendar fourth quarter?
Stacy Smith
Yeah I think -- we saw units up some in Q3. But I think the year-over-year compare probably tells the tale a little bit better. We were down 14%-15% between notebooks and desktops when you compare that against what the third parties would say happen with the TAM, they are kind of down in the more high single digits. So I think we undershipped a bit, relative to the overall TAM. And when we go do our test of inventory, we come back with healthy inventory levels, if that's what you're getting at.
John Pitzer
Well, I guess what I am getting at is, just a seasonal Q4, with a new product launch and undershipping in Q3. I would assume that Q4 could actually be better. I don't know what I am missing relative to that math.
Brian Krzanich
Maybe you and Stacy should go arm wrestle, and between the two of you, you can figure out whether you are too high or too low. So yeah, I mean, there could be headwinds and tailwinds, as we go into the quarter as always. But we are kind of looking at it, saying, we have got healthy inventory levels and we are going into the seasonally stronger selling season. It feels like we are kind of balanced in terms of the risks and opportunities.
John Pitzer
That's helpful. And guys, my follow-up, Brian, just on the Data Center Group, we are going to be a little bit shy of the long term target this year, because of macro. Do you have to rethink what that long term growth rate target should be? And I guess more importantly, at what point is the enterprise part of the business small enough, because that's actually the most macro sensitive, where these macro issues won't kind of be this significant?
Stacy Smith
Sure. So I don't want to -- I am not going to go rethink the long term growth. We are still very confident that we can keep this over the long term, growing at mid-teens level. You really have to take a look at this John, over a longer period of time. you can't live in this industry by a quarter. For example, we have talked about -- enterprise is a bit weak right now and the cloud has been basically helping us in growing at a rate faster than we'd even projected as we entered this year. But what typically happens in the fourth quarter, the cloud enterprises, and not to do large purchases in the fourth quarter. Well they have in the past at times, but in general, don't, because really fourth quarter is their selling season, and so they don't want to disrupt their systems during that quarter, and then it comes back in the first half of the follow-on year.
So there is always this lumpiness to this quarter-by-quarter and you have to look over a much longer period of time.
Your second kind of question built into that, when does cloud and networking and the rest of the infrastructure work. I really want to remind people that, what we are doing in the Data Center is not only just growing cloud versus enterprise, but we are driving hard into networking, we are driving -- next year you will see our Silicon Photonics, you will see FPGAs with Altera, so it’s a broad spectrum of products that should increase our footprint in the Data Center. We haven't set a date for when those are big enough, that they offset enterprise. But its not long, its in the near future that we can offset enterprise weakness.
John Pitzer
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Covello of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jim Covello
Great guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. I will let Stacy and John arm wrestle over the near term stop. I will ask a couple longer term things. First I guess Brian, on the NAND market; obviously this has been a terrific market for you guys. There is a lot going on there, there is a lot of growth opportunities commensurate with what's going on in the Data Center. There seems to be a lot of consternation next year about which of the various players are going to do what, and potential consolidation on the industry. Maybe you could just give us an update on how the NAND market looks to you, as you go out to 2016, and where you see the opportunities, and you know, what kind of investments you think you will need to make there?
Brian Krzanich
Sure Jim. So let's start at kind of the macro level and then work our way down. As you said, the non-volatile business has been very good to us, and it has grown at a better rate than we even anticipate, as we entered the year. We need to remember that, more than 80% of what we sell are enterprise SSDs that are going into those Data Centers. So we made a very tight connection. When we think of our NAND business, we think of it tied very closely to our Data Center business, and in fact, we trend a lot of synergy on the products, the efficiencies, the performance of these products, as we go to market and then, how we go talk to our customers.
If we take a look at next year, its really the ramp of our 3D NAND process, and that we believe gives us a performance and cost advantage over the competition. We are very comfortable with where we are positioned for next year, from that perspective.
In addition, we talked about our 3D XPoint, which is really a transformational product for the memory market. What we said was, we start shipping limited engineering samples end of this year. You have seen on-stage, we showed at IDF and a couple of other places now, working products with benchmarks, we will continue to show more and more of those as we go through this year, and we will start shipping product for that next year.
As I look out in next year and beyond, it really becomes the 3D NAND driving the real high volume, better cost and performance enterprise SSDs and in 3D XPoint, really transforming how memory and storage work together and again, we will target the Data Center and have that very close crosslink between these. But I think 3D XPoint, you will actually see in many-many other products, as the value of both memory, storage, and performance start to play out in a variety of applications, IOT, mobile, all over the place.
Jim Covello
That's very helpful. Thank you. Maybe for a follow-up, I will kind of ask about one of the other longer term drivers that you have talked about, the foundry business to kind of offset what you expect to be continued declines in the PC unit business over time, or continued slow growth in that business over time. So you have talked about NAND, you have also talked about foundry. Could you give us a little bit of an update on the thoughts around foundry, bringing Altera and how its notwithstanding, you still see incremental growth opportunities in that space, even though a lot of them, you can't really talk about too much publicly.
Brian Krzanich
Yeah. We do see incremental growth and as you said, there are deals and have [ph] that we cannot talk about publicly. But I do see it still as a growth business. Its not going to be one of those ones that's going to largely move the needle in the next couple of years, but we do see continued growth and continued acquisition of customers in that space.
Jim Covello
Very helpful. Thanks so much. Good luck.
Brian Krzanich
Thanks Jim.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivek Arya of Bank of America. Your line is open.
Vivek Arya
Thanks. So let me ask a question; for my first question, I am wondering what the current run rate of losses is tied to your division, which I guess formerly was called Mobile Communications Group. So I know last year, on a quarterly basis, you were losing about $1 billion a quarter in MCG, and this year you have made improvement, to $800 million for the year. So on a quarterly basis, Stacy, is it [indiscernible] to assume that the loss there is less than $900 million, so as you make improvements, it continues to be a source of accretion to your EPS?
Stacy Smith
I just want to be clear, we have completely reorganized. We no longer have the MCG segment. So when we talk about this, we are not talking about it in the context of the commitments we have made to improve the overall profitability of our mobile business broadly.
We are well on track to the commitment that we made at the beginning of the year. As Brian said, we have kind of loomed up to having achieved 75% of the overall target. I did say it was a little bit back end loaded, so if you are doing your quarterly math, you'd probably get to a little bit -- you wouldn't be linear, you get to a little bit of a bigger reduction as we move into the back half relative to the first half, because the counter revenue dollars really ramped up for us, as we bought SoFIA into the marketplace and that was more of a back half phenomenon for us.
Vivek Arya
Got it. And then for my follow-up, could you remind us, what is the core mix right now, and as a percentage of your PC clients, and where can it get to, and is that how we should think about, what determines the upper limit on when client ASPs start to saturate, because pricing has been an important part of stability in your PC division?
Stacy Smith
So we will go through some of the mix stuff in the investor meeting in November. The heart of your question, what's driving the upside; I really a lot of it is segmentation. And its interesting, if you use our desktop business as a proxy, we have been in a low unit growth environment for a while, that's kind of slightly down, slightly up kind of thing. This year down a bit more. But we have managed to maintain the profitability of that business, because we are seeing a lot more segmentation of the business. You still have the first time buyer PCs that happen in emerging markets, but increasingly, there is relatively expensive PCs that provide a lot of value to the consumer, in all-in-ones, and we now see dedicated gaming PCs that are doing quite well, and those kinds of things.
I think the future for us is, more segmentation of our product line. I think that helps us both from a standpoint of volume mix and should give us some opportunities in terms of price.
Vivek Arya
All right. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Freedman of Sterne Agee. Your line is open.
Doug Freedman
Hi guys. Thanks very much for taking my question. I am going to really follow-up on one that has already been asked, let's see if I can get a little bit more clarity. First off, congrats on getting the 75% target of the $800 million of savings. Do you want to introduce a new target, given that you are so far along in this, and just to try to get a handle on how much more cost reduction, or what your strategy is really going forward with the mobility side of the business. The tablet units look like they did soften here. So my question really is, what's your target for your mobility IP?
Brian Krzanich
So let me start a bit about the strategy, and we can then lay out. I think Stacy gave you some indication that we are well on our way, and in fact, if you take a look at it, its non-linear. So we should be handling $800 million and probably slightly above that number. How much, we are not going to forecast that right now. Our strategy really when you -- and as we get into the investor meeting, we will talk about it next year. But you can assume, we will have another goal next year, where we do another reduction and improve the P&L. That's fundamental, as we said, we are going to go into this business to make money and we have to get there.
That is absolutely the fundamental strategy. That said, what we said around mobility is that, on tablets, we pretty much keep our share and our position in the market relatively equal to where it was, and everybody sees tablets have shrunk this year as a category. And so we have been careful about not chasing the bottom as prices drop, figuring out where the value is, where we can go in and make a little bit of money, and actually add some innovation. So you're going to see some tablets as we go towards the holidays, with things like RealSense and that allow people new usages and new applications. And as we go into 2016, you will see more of that.
On phones, it’s the same thing. We will be even more careful there, doing partnerships with people, where we can go in, we can provide innovation and the right cost model, make some money for both us and our partners, and we have been very-very careful. And that's why, we have actually said our bigger, longer term strategy there is modems, to the general phone market, and then partnerships for specific products; and that's the Spectrum and Rockchip partnerships that we have right now.
Doug Freedman
Great. Terrific. Thanks for all that color. If I could, similarly, looking over at the Data Center business, clearly cloud has been quite an area of strength. I think investors continue to be concerned about your new competitors entering that market, some people talking about the progress ARM has made. Can you maybe talk about how you are feeling about your competitive positioning against that threat? Thank you.
Brian Krzanich
Absolutely. All these markets, there has always been a competitor. Whether you look in the PC market, or whether you look the Data Center market, or any of these, there has been competitors. We have worked our way up in this position. And our goal is always, to continuously push the product performance and the way we think about it is, is really, what does it take to replace ourselves even, in this market, especially the Data Center. How do we do a total cost of ownership, such that, it pays to go to our next generation, in both footprint, cost of operation and performance. All of those things are what we drive; that and system integration right, the whole [indiscernible] scale architecture and doing system integration, such that it's simpler, quicker and cheaper for people to install a cloud based system. We really focused on those and just really trying to have the best performance we can in that space.
And there will always be competitors and our goal is to just consistently outperform, and there will be new entrants and old entrants all along, trying to win share away from us. That's going to be a norm.
Doug Freedman
Great. And congratulations on the strong results.
Brian Krzanich
Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from David Wong of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
David Wong
Thanks very much. Your Client Computing Group, the operating margins you reported, jumped several percentage points in the September quarter. Can you give us some idea as to what you expect going forward in the near term, and also, do you have a long term goal for operating margin for this Group?
Stacy Smith
So we don't forecast at that level, David. On a long term view, we will -- as we always do, we will give you some thoughts in terms of what the long term growth potential and overall profitability goals are, when we get to November.
In general, what you are seeing there when you look at it sequentially is, you're seeing a quarter where volume was up some, and we had a nice rich mix as we launched Skylake. So that helped a lot from the same point of profitability, quarter-on-quarter. 
David Wong
Okay, great. And are there any new major product launches for Data Center we might expect this year, in the remaining months?
Brian Krzanich
Nothing that we haven't already made public. No.
David Wong
Okay, great. Thanks very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Romit Shah of Nomura. Your line is open.
Romit Shah
Yes, thank you. Had a question on the PC market. Brian, every year, we are looking for -- calling for a bottom in PCs. And last year, the units were better than expected, they were still down. This year has obviously been weaker. But now we are at the point, where you look at the supply chain as you guys characterize, it’s fairly lean. You have got the new operating system from Windows plus Skylake. So it just seems like all the pieces are there for PCs to finally bottom, but I wanted to gauge your confidence?
Brian Krzanich
I guess my answer to that would be, I do believe that we are in a unique situation, where we have, as you said, new operating system with Windows 10. We have our sixth generation core Skylake in place. We have a lot of innovation from OEMs. We have some additional product like -- our innovation like RealSense. You will see some unique memory architectures next year, even 3D XPoint gets into this space. I do think that, there is a good point for optimism. That said, some of these transitions are going to take some time, and so I am very cautious of people to say how fast and when.
So if you take a look at it, there is the ability to do Windows 10 upgrades today, but actually on-shelf, new systems is until later this month. So it’s not until later this month, that actually -- you can walk into the store and get an on-shelf system with Win 10.
Enterprises will go, I think quicker than Win 10 than some of the prior generations of Windows. But still enterprise takes a while to do these kinds of conversions, so it will be into next year, those conversions.
So I do see that this is a great opportunity, and that we should see some tailwinds pushing us into the PC market. But it’s going to be over time. It’s not going to be, boy next quarter it jumps. So I kind of want to lay out that its going to be over next year or so that it takes to get this transition through.
Stacy Smith
If I can just add, as Brian and I talk about the business and think about it. I think this quarter is a great illustration point of how we view it. In a time period, where PC units are down in high single digits at the TAM level. We still get enough growth from the Data Center and the Memory business and the Internet of Things to pretty much tread water in terms of revenue growth, right? And you can see it in our results in Q3, in fact you can see it in our results for the year.
If PC units are down in the mid-single digits, we actually grow at a pretty fast pace, and if we get to where the PC units are flat, we are growing at a very fast pace. That's kind of fixing the growth rate for everything else, but it’s a good way to think about what our strategy is and how we are driving the business. So we don't really need unit growth to grow the company at a fast pace, because we are much less dependent on the PC segment than we have historically been and our growth really comes from -- the Data Center is a very large business and then we are investing in things like Memory and the Internet of Things business that will add some growth to that.
Romit Shah
Helpful. Thank you.
Mark Henninger
Operator, I think we have time for two more questions.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Ambrish Srivastava
Hi. Thank you, Mark. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just had a question on the gross margin Stacy. Looking at the year-over-year comparisons for similar revenue run rate on gross margin is going to be down about 300 bips, is the biggest offsetting factor, on a year-over-year basis, is the startup costs; because unit costs should be getting lower, or am I not right?
Stacy Smith
No. The biggest difference compared to -- if you looked back to Q3 of 2014, if memory serves, I think we were at 65%, we were 63% in Q3 of this year. And units were down some from last year, we talked about this as a weaker TAM. So that's one piece. But the bigger piece is, 14-nanometer costs. And you're right, we are coming down the costs pretty rapidly on 14-nanometer, but its becoming a richer and richer percentage of the overall shipment mix and 14-nanometer still is more than 22-nanometer. And so we have seen a little bit of a mix-up in terms of costs, as we have worked our way through 2015.
Ambrish Srivastava
Got it. So the cadence of the usual tick-tock; the cadence of the startup costs shouldn’t change as much. So in Q1, we should be seeing an increase in startup costs for TAM, correct?
Stacy Smith
We are actually seeing a bit of an increase in startup costs starting in Q4. If you look at the Q4 margin reconciliation, you start to see that increasing startup costs.
Ambrish Srivastava
So it shifted more to Q4, and there won't be as much in Q1, is that the right takeaway there?
Stacy Smith
Well, keep in mind, the elevation started since the last, way more than one quarter. I am just saying, you are seeing the front edge of the elevated 10-nanometer startup costs as kind of starting as we speak.
Ambrish Srivastava
Got it. Okay. Thanks for the clarification. Thank you.
Stacy Smith
Thanks Ambrish.
Operator
Thank you. Our final question comes from Michael McConnell of Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open.
Michael McConnell
Thank you. Just regarding DCG again. I think I recall in Q2, the weakness in enterprise was largely in China. Just in that bucket, are you starting to see the weakness spread out into different geographic regions, or is this still mostly isolated in China, relative to your original expectations?
Brian Krzanich
Yes. I think we said in Q2 that it was more pronounced in China, but it was general across the enterprise, and that is consistent with what we see now. I just want to come back to what Brian said earlier, the overall enterprise segment is weak, and when you look at it, that correlates very closely for us over time with GDP growth rates, and the GDP growth rates are quite a bit less than we thought, when we started the year.
We are offsetting much of that -- in fact, we are offsetting most of that, by a cloud growth rate that's significantly more than we thought when we started the year. So general macroeconomic weakness, it’s pronounced in China, but we see it elsewhere in the enterprise segment, being offset by, I'd say torrid growth rates and cloud computing, and we will share more of that when we get to November.
Michael McConnell
Okay, great. And then just my final follow-up would be, just relative to PC end demand, as far as you can tell the early part of this quarter, obviously we will get more signals here over the next month or so. What are you seeing right now with the end demand side, not necessarily the channel inventory ups and downs?
Brian Krzanich
We can't give you – we aren’t going to talk about the current quarter in this call.
Stacy Smith
I would just say, everything that we knew as of one o'clock this afternoon is reflected in our forecast.
Michael McConnell
Great. Thank you.
Stacy Smith
Thank you.
Mark Henninger
All right. Thank you all for joining us today. Amanda, please go ahead and wrap up the call.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Intel Corporation second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Mark Henninger, head of Investor Relations. You may begin.
Mark H. Henninger - Vice President-Finance & Director-IR
Thank you, Nicole, and welcome, everyone, to Intel's second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. By now you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with it. If you've not received both documents, they're available on our Investor website, intc.com.
I'm joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO; and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them, followed by Q&A.
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, does include risk and uncertainty. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.
Also, if during this call we use any non-GAAP financial measures or references, we'll post the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliation to our website, intc.com.
With that, let me turn it over to Brian.
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Mark.
Our second quarter results were consistent with our outlook as a year-over-year decline in the PC business was partially offset by 10% growth in our Data Center business, more than 40% growth in NAND revenue, and 4% growth in our IoT segment. I'll take just a moment to review our results before discussing the rest of the year, the Altera acquisition, and a process and product technology update too.
During this quarter, we qualified our sixth generation Core products, previously code named Skylake for production, and we continue to see excitement in the industry for the launch of these products and Windows 10. And while there were year-over-year declines in desktop and notebook volume, we saw record Core desktop mix due to growth in the high-end segment and record Core i7 mix overall for the PC business.
We're excited about the opportunities created by new products from our OEM partners and the upcoming launch of Windows 10. We worked closely with Microsoft to make sure the best Windows 10 PC and tablet experience run on Intel.
We have also updated our mobile roadmap. Our OEMs' first Atom x3, x5, and x7 products were announced and are ramping using our previously code named Cherry Trail SoFIA 3G and SoFIA 3G-R products. The 4G version of our Atom x3 platform, SoFIA LTE, is sampling now for network certification, and is expected to ship in volume in the first half of next year. Our latest LTE modem, the CAT-10 7360, is on track for shipments to customers this year.
The Data Center business continued to perform, growing 10% over Q2 last year, and we remain on track to grow this business by more than 15% year over year. Again, this quarter we saw the growth of consumer services fueling the build-out of the cloud. We also saw very strong growth in network infrastructure with the continuing migration of workloads onto Intel architecture and the rise of network function virtualization. These areas of strength were partially offset by weakness in the Enterprise segment.
While our overall billings roughly matched our forecast, PC supply chain inventories declined at a slower rate than we expected, as PC demand weakened further. While we are expecting a seasonal second half, we're now forecasting total revenue to decline by about 1% for the full year, down from our prior expectation of approximately flat.
I'd like to shift gears now and talk about a couple of important strategic updates. Last month, we announced our plan to acquire Altera, a leading FPGA vendor. We see four key strategic drivers behind this acquisition. First, we believe we can enhance Altera's base FPGA ARM-based business substantially. We plan to do this through our leadership in Moore's Law and our ability to execute designs using our tools and silicon more quickly, allowing us to continue to support and develop their ARM-based products. Second, history tells us that the FPGA vendor who is first to a manufacturing process node enjoys a market segment share advantage over the life of that node.
Finally, integrating Altera's world-class technology with Intel architecture in the high-growth data center and Internet of Things market segments will create new product categories and capabilities. We expect this strategy to produce significant shareholder value, and we're looking forward to implementing our plans. We plan to have a deeper discussion on the value drivers underlying this strategy at our investor meeting this fall.
The last thing I'd like to share with you is an update related to our 10-nanometer technology transition. Just last quarter we celebrated the 50th anniversary of Moore's Law. In 1965, when Gordon's paper was first published, he predicted a doubling of transistor density every year for at least the next 10 years. His prediction proved to be right. And in fact, in 1975, looking ahead to the next 10 years, he updated his estimate to a doubling every 24 months. These transitions are a natural part of the history of Moore's Law and are a by-product of the technical challenges of shrinking transistors while ensuring they can be manufactured in high volume.
As node transitions lengthened, we adapted our approach to the Tick-Tock method, which gave us a second product on each node. This strategy created better products for our customers and a competitive advantage for Intel. It also disproved the death of Moore's Law predictions many times over. The last two technology transitions have signaled that our cadence today is closer to 2.5 years than two.
To address this cadence, in the second half of 2016 we plan to introduce a third 14-nanometer product, code named Kaby Lake, built on the foundations of the Skylake micro-architecture but with key performance enhancements. Then in the second half of 2017, we expect to launch our first 10-nanometer product, code named Cannonlake. We expect that this addition to the roadmap will deliver new features and improved performance and pave the way for a smooth transition to 10-nanometers.
As we move forward, we are focused on innovation and execution. We continue to be confident in our strategy to drive growth.
And with that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Thanks, Brian.
Revenue for the second quarter was $13.2 billion, in line with our outlook and down 5% year on year, as a result of lower desktop and notebook platform volume. This was partially offset by increases in the Data Center Group and NAND. Quarter on quarter, revenue was up 3%. Second quarter gross margin of 62.5% was 0.5 point above our outlook. Operating income of $2.9 billion was down 25% year over year and up 11% quarter over quarter. Net income was $2.7 billion, down 3% year over year. Earnings per share of $0.55 was flat year over year.
The Client Computing group had revenue of $7.5 billion, a 14% decrease year over year. Both desktop and notebook unit volumes were down as a result of lower demand in the business segment and in emerging markets.
In terms of the worldwide PC supply chain, we saw a slight decline of inventory levels quarter over quarter and believe that overall inventory levels are normal. Our own inventory declined in units but grew in dollars, as we refreshed inventory levels with 14-nanometer products.
Tablet unit volumes were 9.9 million units, up 11% year over year. We are on track to our annual goal of improving mobile profitability by $800 million, with about a third of the improvement realized to date. Operating profit for the overall Client Computing group was $1.6 billion, down 38% year over year.
Our business portfolio continues to transform. We're growing the Data Center, Internet of Things, and NAND business, which accounted for almost 40% of our revenue and more than 70% of the company's overall operating profit in the second quarter. The Data Center Group had revenue of $3.9 billion, 10% growth year over year, driven by very strong results in cloud and networking infrastructure. The Data Center Group had operating profit of $1.8 billion, flat year over year. Additionally, year over year, the Internet of Things segment achieved revenue growth of 4%, and the NAND business achieved record revenue and grew at over 40%.
The business continued to generate significant cash, with $3.4 billion of cash from operations in the second quarter. We purchased $1.8 billion in capital assets, paid $1.1 billion in dividends, and repurchased about $700 million of stock in the second quarter. Total cash balance at the end of the quarter was $13.9 billion, flat to the first quarter. Our net cash balance, total cash less debt and inclusive of our other longer-term investments, is approximately $4 billion.
Over the next two to three quarters, we expect to complete the acquisition of Altera for $16.7 billion. The financing plan for this acquisition is to issue $7 billion to $9 billion in new long-term debt and finance the remaining balance with our cash and short-term commercial paper. As we generate free cash flow, we expect to get back to approximately zero net cash in the second half of 2016.
As we look forward to the third quarter of 2015, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $14.3 billion, up 8% from the second quarter. This forecast is at the higher-end range of the average seasonal increase for the third quarter. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range to be 63%, a 0.5 point increase from the second quarter.
Turning to the full year 2015, we expect revenue to be down approximately 1% from 2014, lower than our prior guidance of approximately flat. Our expectations are that the PC market is going be weaker than previously expected. We continue to forecast robust growth rates in the Data Center Group, Internet of Things Group, and NAND businesses, which we expect to mostly offset the PC decline.
We are forecasting the midpoint of capital spending at $7.7 billion, down $1 billion from the prior outlook. This is driven primarily by manufacturing efficiencies and changes in timing for purchases. We are forecasting the midpoint of our gross margin range at 61.5%, up 0.5 point from our prior guidance. And we are forecasting the midpoint of R&D and MG&A spending for the year at $19.8 billion, up $100 million from the prior outlook.
The second quarter financials came in a little better than our expectations. As we look at the second half, we expect seasonal market growth from here, and we are very excited about the devices based on Skylake, our sixth-generation Core processor, that are coming to market. Additionally, we expect continued robust growth in the Data Center, Internet of Things, and NAND business. And lastly, we are working to complete the acquisition of Altera. This acquisition will broaden our product portfolio, enable innovation in our current product line, and deliver value for our shareholders.
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.
Mark H. Henninger - Vice President-Finance & Director-IR
Okay, thank you, Brian and Stacy. Moving on to the Q&A, as is our normal practice, we would ask each participant to ask one question and a follow-up if you have one. Nicole, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you for taking my question. Brian, I'm trying to reconcile your concern about the PC market with the seasonal guidance that you're giving for the back half. So for instance, you're guiding up 8% for Q3 and implied it's up 5% for Q4. How much benefit are you expecting from Windows 10, because I think there is very limited conviction whether that would indeed be a growth driver for PC? So I'm just trying to reconcile your caution with just seasonal guidance. Are you being adequately conservative with your second half guidance?
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure, Vivek. We think we – remember, this is seasonal off Q2, which was down. So this is off a forecasted and actual Q2 that was down from our original assumptions for this year. And so we believe that yes, a seasonal forecast off that, roughly seasonal, is a reasonable forecast for the remainder of this year. You also saw in the announcement that Stacy and I took down our overall revenue guidance a bit as well to be in line with all of that, the seasonal guidance off a lowered Q2. I don't know, Stacy, if you have something else you want to add.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
I'll just piggyback, Vivek, to the commentary on the last call. If you remember, our prediction for Q2 was that inventory levels would be taken down fairly significantly, which is unusual in a Q2. What we actually saw in the second quarter is inventory levels did come down but they're kind of at normal. And so what you're seeing now in Q3 is a little bit of a pipeline fill based on inventory levels that came down in Q2 against the backdrop of Q2s that normally would have inventory levels going up. So it's the same phenomenon of some shift of billings from Q2 to Q3. It's just much more muted than what we thought a quarter ago.
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
But we didn't base that or we didn't base any of the forecast in the second half off an upside from Win 10 launch. We're excited about Win 10 launch and Skylake. We believe great products are coming to market, but we didn't build in a large increase. That's why we stuck with the seasonal off the lowered Q2.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
We're getting a lot out on your one question. I'd also say if you zoom out, our view of the PC market now is down in the high single digits. And our view a quarter ago was a PC market that was down in the more mid-single digits. So we've definitely brought down our expectations of the PC market overall for the year, but you're still seeing a little bit of that inventory lumpiness.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it, very helpful. And then as my follow-up on the Data Center business, I understand it's lumpy and there are many moving pieces. But you're still expecting mid-teens growth for the year but in Q2 it slowed down to 10%. And I think you mentioned enterprise as one area of weakness. So are you anticipating a recovery there in the back half, and are you seeing any impact with all the macro headwinds in Europe and China for instance?
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
So if you take a look at the Data Center and you take a look at the first half, remember, we exited Q1 at about 19% growth. And we said hey, that's pretty robust. Don't expect that for the whole year. You take that 19% and combine it with this 10%, the first half actually played out right close to between 14% and 15%, which was what we've said would be roughly our growth rate in this business. We did say that enterprise was weaker than we had forecasted, but the cloud has been stronger. We've taken that cloud – actually cloud, networking, and some storage as well, all three of those have been stronger and enterprise weaker. We took that same model and carried that through the rest of the year. So we do not expect a large recovery of the enterprise as we go through the remainder of this year.
You said it. The headwinds are the macroeconomic, companies looking at how do they spend their capital and when do they deploy their capital, being careful about that. All those things are causing enterprise to be a bit weaker, and we didn't say there would be a big recovery of that. We do think the other trends, the cloud continuing to grow, networking continuing to grow, especially with the conversion, software-defined infrastructure, and storage continuing to grow. We do believe those will continue, and that's what drives the second half as well.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Great, thank you.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.
Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC
Thank you so much. First question, Stacy, for the first time now you're moving to a Tick-Tock-Tock model. So I'm wondering if you can talk about what the CapEx implications are for that, and maybe also what the gross margin implications are for maybe the back half of this year and into next year. Thanks.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Sure, a lot in that question, so let me take a shot and you can come back if I don't appropriately or adequately answer all of it. The CapEx implications, so we've taking down our CapEx forecast again this cycle relatively significantly from where we were at the beginning of the year. If you go back to the beginning of the year, what you see in terms of the reduction in CapEx, it's been – I'll call it four buckets. There's a big piece that's just factory efficiency. We talked about this last quarter. The 14-nanometer factories are becoming more efficient. Our confidence in that ramp has gone up, so that was a chunk of it.
We talked last quarter about taking advantage of some of the unit weakness that we saw to bring down the capacity in our 22-nanometer factories. And we successfully executed on that in the second quarter. We took the utilization down. We took a bunch of capacity offline. We rolled it forward to 14-nanometers, so that was a chunk of what we're seeing. We talked a bit about desktop units being lower as a result of the XP refresh last year. That's a piece.
And then there's a big chunk associated with this third wave of products that Brian talked about. And so just isolating then on that, the implications in this generation are that we'll be at the 14-nanometer peak for longer, and we'll delay a little bit some of the purchases on 10-nanometer from when we were on a two-year cadence. And so that is definitely a piece of the lower CapEx this year.
In terms of the gross margin implications, minor; for us the key is to have great products, and that's why we're adding in this third wave of products. At the first approximation, that's the best correlation of gross margin is when you've got leadership products, you tend to have a healthy gross margin. It does change the shape of startup costs a little bit, and you can see the 10-nanometer costs are a bit later than normal. But we'll talk more about that at the investor meeting in Q4.
Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC
Thanks a lot. And then I guess just as a follow-up, is the push-out on 10-nanometer, can you give us just a little color in terms of what should be happening there? Is that simply the result of Broadwell having pushed out, or is there something specific to 10-nanometer that is causing it to push? Thanks.
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
No, I'd call it similar to what happened on 14-nanometer. Remember, on all of these technologies, each one has its own recipe of complexity and difficulty, 14-nanometer to 10-nanometer same thing that happened from 22-nanometer to 14-nanometer. The lithography is continuing to get more difficult as you try and scale and the number of multi-pattern steps you have to do is increasing. This is the longest period of time without a lithography node change. So we're assuming 10-nanometers does not have EUV [Extreme Ultra-Violet] for our technology; that combined with just the other material science changes you do with the new technology.
And then you look at the pattern we've been having with the same kind of sets of conditions, which was the 22-nanometer technology and the 14-nanometer technology. And we said those took about 2.5 years. And the feedback from our customers that said, look, we really want you to be predictable. That's as important as getting to that leading edge. We chose to actually just go ahead and insert; since nothing else had changed, insert this third wave.
When we go from 10-nanometer to 7-nanometer, it will be another set of parameters that we'll reevaluate this. We'll always strive to get back to two years. And we'll take a look at what's the maturity of EUV, what's the maturity of the material science changes that are occurring, what's the complexity of the product roadmap that we're adding, and make that adjustment out in the future here. So, we took a snapshot of the 14-nanometer to 10-nanometer transition. We looked at the history, and we said let's be very predictable and do the best thing for shareholders and for our partners and customers.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Good afternoon, guys. Brian, maybe just to follow up on Tim's question around the Moore's Law cadence, one of the things that Intel has always done better than most is get down Moore's Law more quickly. And I understand there are definitional differences of line nodes and not everyone's 10-nanometers is the same. But relative to the targets you've put out this afternoon for second half of 2017, if you look at some of the publicly available data from some of your manufacturing competitors, it appears like everyone's going to get to 10-nanometers at the same time. So how do you guys think about that historic relative manufacturing lead relative to those peers, and how should we think about it?
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
I think first, John, I'll just say, we believe, even with this 2017, our lead in Moore's Law will not change dramatically. We believe we'll continue to lead with roughly the same leadership position that we have today. We base that on, one, what really counts when I talk about 2017, that's not samples, that's not small volume. That's converting over to Cannonlake and producing a large percentage of our CPUs in volume in the second half of 2017. So there's a bit of definition. When we say second half of 2017 we're talking about millions of units and large volumes.
And then as you said, there's this definitional difference, right. This will be now our third generation of FinFETs by then. It will have several other transistor enhancements. And we believe if you take a look at the scaling, it will be quite strong relative to the normal scaling parameters that occur with the Moore's Law transition. I'm not going give you the exact numbers right now. But we think if you combine all those together, our leadership position doesn't change, even with this date.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
That's helpful. And then, guys, going back to DCG, relative to the full-year guidance of growing at least 15% year over year, it does assume a reacceleration of year-over-year growth. I know it's a business where seasonality is less relevant than PCs, but it would suggest a second half that's growing half on half much more significantly than it historically has. And so I'm curious. Is the expectation enterprise comes back to bolster what's been strong, cloud, or how do you think about the growth profile of DCG in the back half of the year, if it needs to reaccelerate year over year?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Hey, John. This is Stacy. So I think if you look at DCG, we've said for years it's lumpy. We've deconstructed what happened in Q1 and Q2. When you look across the quarters, we're growing 14% to 15%. That's pretty consistent with what we expect for the year. So I think you'll come up with a number that's pretty consistent with that in the back half of the year.
As we zoom out a bit on the market, from what we thought when we started the year, as Brian said, we'd say that we're seeing an enterprise market that's weaker than expected. We're not expecting a lot of incremental strength there. It's more macroeconomic driven than anything else, and we're not predicting a big macroeconomic boom in the back half. But that's being offset by a cloud market primarily, but also networking and storage that is stronger than what we expected. And we saw some spectacular growth rates in networking – in the cloud segment of the business this quarter.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
That's helpful. Thanks, guys.
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
The only thing I would add to that, John, is the same dynamic that causes the enterprise to be a little bit weaker, those macroeconomics, drives businesses and organizations to move their workloads to the cloud. What I'm seeing is there's a little bit of a counteract between those two, which is why we've said no, we believe that overall the year will be – on balance, still grow at that 15%. But again, we are looking over the long haul. Don't get caught by a quarter in this kind of a growth rate.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely of Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Thanks, guys. So you said that your PC forecast has gone down from I guess 5% to down high single digits. One question on that is, on your inventory, have you adjusted your inventory to I guess increase the server products and decrease some of the PC processors? And can you give us a sense of where you expect inventory to trend in the second half of the year?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Sure. It's less driven by server and more driven by the mix of Skylake on 14-nanometer. And so what happened in Q2 is that, as you can see, dollars went up but units were down, and actually down a bit more than we had expected when we started the quarter. But the mix of the units that are in inventory have shifted from 22-nanometer products to 14-nanometer. And within 14-nanometer, we're starting to see the shift from Broadwell to Skylake. And so it's a more expensive product because it's brand new. It's also the newest product, which gives me a lot of comfort about what's sitting in inventory.
As we play out through the rest of the year, what we expect to happen is that units will continue to come down from here. 14-nanometer comes down the cost curve, but the inventory shifts even more dramatically from Broadwell to Skylake. And so when I take those three trends into account, I'm predicting that we'll end the year with inventory levels roughly flat to where we are today, not dramatically different. But again, units will be down, dollars will be flat.
Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Great, and for my follow-up, just I guess a longer-term question on the PC market. You guys are closer to it than anybody. Why do you think it's so weak this year? Do you think that – should we be expecting down 5% to 10% every year? Is there something going on? Has your long-term outlook on the PC market changed? Any color you could provide as to why this is happening would be very helpful.
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. If I had a perfect mirror into this, this wouldn't be a forecast. It would be a guaranteed schedule of earnings for the next couple of quarters. In general, I think if you look at it, the PC has always had a fairly decent tie to GDP, both for the countries that we sell in. but then I think if you just look at the worldwide GDP, so worldwide GDP growth has slowed, especially in areas like China, where a lot of growth in PCs was occurring. But even in the mature areas like the U.S. and Western Europe, that has caused it to slow down a bit more.
I think there has been a little bit of a stall. There's always a little bit of a stall right before a new product like Skylake. But when you have a new product like Skylake combined with a new OS like Win 10, which the majority of these devices will run on, that tends to have people waiting to see what those products are going to be. What's going be offered, the new form factors? How is Windows 10 accepted? So I think you put all these together, it's made a bit – 2015 be weaker on the PC than we had anticipated.
Long term, I still think it's a great form factors we have coming, we're going to be talking about all-day battery lives, no wires. We've got some great thin form factors. The fact that there's very little difference between a two-in-one device and a tablet and the ability to take back that volume onto the PC, all those things put together, I still stick with the forecast that we can keep this stable, that it will be over the long haul relatively flat. There will be years like last year that it's up. There will be years like this year that will be down, depending on all of those factors, but over the long haul, relatively flat forecast.
Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Okay.
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Remember, that's how we built our growth strategy. Our growth strategy was hold the PC as close to flat as we can and growing the Data Center, growing IoT, growing NAND and memory. And you heard from Stacy's report, the amount of earnings and income that's coming now from those segments is quite significant and growing faster and faster as they get bigger.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis of Barclays. Your line is now open.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow up on the outlook into the second half. Windows 10, they're talking about giving it away to the consumer. Obviously, enterprises always adopt new platforms later. So just curious of your thoughts this time where you have the software given away for free. What are your thoughts in terms of that impacting the consumer demand?
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
When you talk about that, first let's just talk about our forecast, our basic forecast. Remember, we said it's basically seasonal off the lowered Q2. We didn't build in a big boom from the Windows 10 transition. That said, we are excited about it. You're right. It has a free upgrade. But a lot of the really good features of Windows 10, things like Windows 10 Hello, where you have facial log-in and you don't have to use all your passwords, the start screen and your ability to go through that, the touch usages of gaming as they move games more and more onto this product, those are going to come with PCs that have the latest features.
And so that combined with products like Skylake, over the long haul, I think Windows 10 will be a boost for the PC market. It will take some of the negativity about Windows 8 out of that marketplace, and I think it will be a real positive for us. As you said, some people will have to go through a free upgrade and then see what they really wanted and see the new form factors and go okay, I'm going to upgrade. Some of the enterprise guys will take a little bit longer because enterprises always have to check everything they've got on the new OS. And that's why we didn't really build it into the forecast as a big plus for the second half of this year. I think if you look long term, it's going be a positive.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Thanks, and then just, Stacy, a follow-up on a prior gross margin question. You typically get a benefit in the second year of a process node. You said the third year you don't get much benefit. Is that because you've gotten the yields pretty maxed out in the second year, or are you adding more content? What are your thoughts on why you don't get another little bit of a boost on a third year?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
I didn't mean to say that I don't get a benefit on the third year of a process technology. I haven't provided a forecast yet for next year, but I would expect that a third-wave product coming out on 14-nanometers will have a good cost structure. You have a very healthy process running at high utilization. That tends to be the sweet spot. If you look at 22-nanometer, you've seen that phenomenon, not because we had a third wave, but just because the process was running full relatively – on a relatively mature process. And in fact, we got great costs out of it. So my comment was about startup costs. It does change the trend of startup costs, and I'll provide more insight into that at the investor meeting in the fourth quarter.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hi, guys, a quick question on the formerly-called PCG side of things. It sounds like the inventory in the channel didn't burn as much as you thought. Are you building in that it bounces back just to normal levels? I would think that your sequentials would be impacted off of a relatively higher base, given that that didn't burn down in the second quarter. So put that all together, how does the lack of that burn in the second quarter fall into your guidance for the third?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Remember last quarter what we were expecting was a substantial burn of inventory. And the way we articulated that, our belief was that customers would burn off inventory levels in advance of Windows 10 and then replenish inventory levels in the third quarter. What we actually saw was much more normal than that. We saw customers maintain inventory levels. I think their confidence in the overall PC market grew some as they worked through the quarter and got towards the end of the quarter. So I had articulated we have relatively normal inventory levels now. We expect relatively normal inventory levels in the third quarter. Historically, you see inventory build some in the third quarter in anticipation of the Q4 selling season.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And I guess as my follow-on, a bit of a longer-term question. It's on the OpEx side of things. Clearly, OpEx to revenue will come down closer to your target in the back half of this year if you guys hit the forecast that you laid out. But you're still well above the 30% OpEx to revenue targets you have. What's the plan to get there? Last year was better than expected on revenues and you didn't really get much leverage on that metric. This year has obviously been a little bit worse, so it's a bit more challenging. Is there ever the need to do something more structural, or is it only going to be grow to get to the target?
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
I think it has to be growth. Structural would mean starting to lower our investments in things like the Data Center or IoT, and I really think that would be the wrong thing to do to keep this company growing. I think we have to get this by the growth metric. And our models say if we can stabilize the PC and continue to grow at our forecasted numbers for the Data Center and IoT and NAND, we get there. And we have a plan to not grow our spending while that growth occurs, or grow the revenue faster. And we just need to get that and execute to that.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso of Susquehanna Financial. Your line is now open.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Thank you. Just first question to clarify going back to something you said with regard to the revenue expectations for the year, the change in your expectations from last quarter, the 1% change, was that entirely due to your comments on the PC channel, the PC segment, and the DCG expectations are essentially unchanged? Is that the right way to think about that?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yes, entirely is a word that makes me nervous, but it's the vast majority of the change. I guess I'd also say it's a much smaller business, but I'd also say our expectations on the year have come down for the IoTG business, but that's not adding up to a big number at the corporate level. Some of the issues that Brian talked about, macroeconomics and the sectors in which we play, I think we're unlikely to be at the growth rate that we were at last year. We'll be a little bit less than the prior year (38:38).
But again, the big dollars are the PC TAM. Our expectations last quarter were down mid-single digits. We're now down high single digits. That puts us in the low end of what we see from third parties, although in fairness they're revising their forecasts over the next quarter.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Okay, great. As a follow-up, with regards to mobile, you had a goal to reduce your mobile operating losses this year. Your comments on SoFIA LTE, I think that's a little later than what you had indicated earlier. Does that have any effect on your ability to reduce the mobile operating losses? And maybe just give us a general indication of where you stand against those goals.
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Not at all. So SoFIA, as you said, it's a little bit later than what we wanted. The good news is it's out. It's yielding well. It's, as we said, in carrier validation. And it will ship in volume in the first half of next year.
As far as the spending reduction targets we had for mobile, we've said we'd get $800 million out. I think Stacy in his part of the presentation stated we're right on target actually to do that. We're very happy with our results there and have already done about a third of it out of the system. It was back-end loaded as the SoFIA 3G, not LTE, products ramped. So we feel like we have a very good detailed plan to go and continue. And we'll at the investor meeting update you on how we'll continue that program to reduce the costs and the losses again next year as well.
And really that's part of – the SoFIA LTE is a good example. We weren't going to go spend the money to necessarily try and pull that product back in versus say, you know what, it's fine in the first half of the year and the product is healthy. It's more important that we get an LTE product for 2016. And getting it in early in 2016 is going to be just fine.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ian Ing of MKM Partners. Your line is now open.
Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC
Yes, thanks. I'm looking for some color on this strength in memory. It looks like NAND is up 40% year over year. Working with Micron, it seems the offerings are actually relatively stale. So I was just wondering if migration to TLC and 3D NAND is going benefit you or if that doesn't really affect enterprise.
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
No. Maybe I'm not quite understanding your question, but our conversion to 3D NAND we believe is a major boost to our product roadmap, both in a performance standpoint and a cost. And remember, we believe we have an architectural advantage to how we've built with Micron our 3D NAND over the competition. And we believe that as those products ramp into the second half and into next year, the performance and cost advantage of 3D NAND will be quite visible. So we're full go on that.
Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC
Yeah, so...
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
In terms of the Q2 results, Ian, I think what you're seeing is the positioning of our products in enterprise and compute, those markets were relatively strong. In particular, we saw strength in cloud-based NAND, and we saw some strength in China based on some specific design wins that we had there.
Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC
Great. And then for a follow-up, your full-year gross margin guidance does imply a falloff in Q4. You're attributing it to a 14-nanometer ramp. Should we see that as a transient issue, or does that get more normalized in the future after that?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
No, in Q4, what I would attribute it to is 10-nanometer startup costs, not 14-nanometer. The costs on 14-nanometer are coming down nicely over the course of the year. What happened specifically in Q4 is we started to see the steep part of the curve on 10-nanometer startup costs.
Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC
Okay, so that's very transient or that's more prolonged into next year? I know you can't guide that far, but...
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
I'd say it's cyclical. You've seen these cycles from us every two years. As we start up a new process technology, you get a couple of quarters where the gross margin has a significant portion of startup costs in it, and then it starts getting better from there.
Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC
Okay. Thank you, Stacy.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great, thank you. I wanted to understand; you've described Q3 and Q4 as roughly seasonal. But if I look at it, your average Q3 the last two years has been up 5% and you're guiding up 8%. The average Q4 has been up a little less than 1%, and the implied is up 5%. So what is the delta there that fits the overall number? That looks like a little bit better than at least your last few years' seasonality.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
So versus – let's just talk about Q3. Q3 acknowledged that the revenue's at the higher end of the seasonal range. The point we were making earlier is we think the market is pretty seasonal, but we saw an unusual inventory depletion in Q2. We think some of that inventory fill has just shifted into Q3. So there's a little bit of a billing shift. It's not a lot. It's maybe a couple of points at the top line.
Q4, I think you have to be a little careful with the math about implied. I think if you just assume – we've said on the call we're expecting Q4 to be roughly seasonal. And I think if you plug that in, you're still rounding to the number that I gave you for the year.
Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it, okay. Great, thank you for that. And then with regards to the savings on the wireless side, with SoFIA late, it seems like you would have less of the subsidies rolling off. So can you talk about what are the sources of the $800 million savings, how much of that is lower subsidies versus other potential cost savings in that segment?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Remember that the SoFIA that has been shipping since the first half of the year is the SoFIA 3G. That was the vast majority of the improvement in margin dollars and contra-revenue dollars. That product was right on time. In fact, I think we said it was even a little bit early in high volume as we go into the back half. The shift that Brian was talking about is the SoFIA LTE version. There was almost no volume this year, and it will be in the market first half next year.
Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great, thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy at Stifel. Your line is now open.
Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Thank you for taking my question. Just to be clear, when will SoFIA come in house for manufacturing?
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
That's different than the LTE version that we're talking about. So the LTE version that we've been talking about in this call is one that's still manufactured outside. And we said that will be the first half. The target for the LTE on the inside or Intel 14-nanometer is the back half of the year.
Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay, great. And can you say how some of your relationships with the Chinese manufacturers have worked out? Are there significant design wins? Are you getting good traction?
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
One of the products that we listed that's ramping this year and has been going quite well is the SoFIA 3G-R. R stands for Rockchip. So that's a part that was co-designed between Intel and Rockchip. So that part is in market selling today, and so I'd say that that portion of the Chinese relationships has gone quite well and is quite far along now.
The other relationship that we have in this space is with Spreadtrum. That deal is still going through closure. It had to go through a variety of regulatory approvals in China. It's looking to close fairly soon now. But the engineering teams have already started to engage and look at product roadmaps and start to build product roadmaps together. So that relationship is going quite well. It's just not nearly as far along.
Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay, great. Thank you.
Mark H. Henninger - Vice President-Finance & Director-IR
Thanks, Kevin. And, operator, we'll go ahead and take two more questions.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI
Good afternoon, thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, in the move to Tick-Tock-Tock, I'm curious what the implications are for your long-term CapEx run rate, and then how we should think about the implications to free cash flow.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
I'm going to punt on that one, C.J., until the investor meeting and we'll talk a bit more. And one of the reasons that's hard is, as Brian talked about, each one of these process technology transitions has its own personality. At 7-nanometer, we're trying to bring in EUV. Depending on the health of that, we could be at two years, we could be at 2.5 years, and that will change this answer. So we'll give more insight into this in the Q4 investor meeting.
C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI
So are we...
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
The CapEx and free cash flow are directly linked.
C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI
So is this a temporary phenomenon, or is this – you're just not sure?
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
I think it's we're not sure. It's a good forecast for this year. We've told you what's going to happen at 10-nanometers with 2017. So you can now model out – that's part of why we wanted to get this out to everybody today. You can now model out what the typical CapEx would be given that schedule, based on previous node transitions. But what we're saying is don't necessarily count on that for 10-nanometers to 7-nanometers. We'll again take a look at the tool set that's available, the maturity of those tools, the maturity of the material science additions that we'll be doing, what's the next around FinFET transistors and other kinds of materials that we'll put into the transistor or the die itself. And when you take a look at all those, we'll be trying to pull it into two years, but we really won't know. And we won't be able to give a signal to that until, my guess, late next year at the earliest.
C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI
Sure.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
And just as I think about this and simplify it in my head, the way I think about it is if a process node were on a two-year cadence, two waves of products is the thing that delivers the best value to the customers and then we quickly get to the next node. When the process node transition shifts out to be longer than that, then that third wave of products gives us another opportunity to deliver features to the customer. And so the uncertainty you're hearing isn't whether this is a good model or not. The uncertainty is 7-nanometer, there's still enough open questions that we don't know exactly the cadence.
Mark H. Henninger - Vice President-Finance & Director-IR
Thanks, C.J.
C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. The first half was marked by weakness in desktop, primarily lackluster demand pull from the SMB market. Is some of the strength in the second half predicated on some of this SMB desktop demand coming back, or is it going be mostly consumer driven?
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
We don't usually forecast to that level forward looking. But I would tell you in general we don't see the market shifting dramatically from the first half to the second half. So I don't think there's going be a huge resurgence of SMB in the desktop. There are some good products coming out on Skylake in the desktop space, but that's not necessarily something we forecasted as a big return for right now. So the majority of this seasonality that we've projected is based on just standard consumer, which as you said, has got a higher percentage of laptop, two-in-one, thin and light devices.
Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay, thanks for that insight. And then back to the flash business, obviously another solid quarter of growth. I think you guys are number one in enterprise SSD with about 25% market share. I just wanted to confirm that the team is still on track to roll out 3D NAND-based platforms in the second half of the year. And then secondarily, how do the cost per bit yield and reliability metrics look relative to your planar-based 2D NAND products?
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
So absolutely I can tell you that we're on schedule to ramp the products in the second half. 3D NAND is looking quite good. From a cost, yield, and performance, I don't think we've gone public with much of those numbers right now. But what we have said is that 3D NAND, especially with the architectural choices that Micron and Intel chose, we believe gives a significant cost and performance advantage over their competitors, and those specifics are holding as we go through the ramp process. So we haven't broken down it's X% or anything like that yet.
Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
I appreciate it. Okay, thank you.
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
We'll be doing NAND updates as we go through the back half of this year and give you guys more color in that space. Clearly, at the investor meeting that Stacy talked about, we'll spend some time on NAND because, as you said, it's a good growth area for the company right now.
Mark H. Henninger - Vice President-Finance & Director-IR

Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the First Quarter 2015 Intel Corporation Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today’s conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the call over to Mark Henninger, Head of Intel Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Mark Henninger
Thank you, Jenny and welcome everyone, to Intel’s first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. By now, you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with it. If you’ve not received both documents, they are available on our Investor Web site, intc.com. I am joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO; and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we’ll hear brief remarks from both of them, followed by the Q&A.
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today’s discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Also if during this call, we use any non-GAAP financial measures or references, we will post the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliation to our Web site, intc.com.
With that, let me hand it over to Brian.
Brian Krzanich
Thanks Mark. Following a reset to our outlook in March, the first quarter finished roughly as expected. Our PC business was impacted by slowing desktop sales, particularly in small and medium business. At the same time, challenging macroeconomic conditions and an appreciating U.S. dollar weighed on our business in important geographic markets. Despite this, revenue was flat year-over-year as our Data Center, Internet of Things, and NAND business all delivered double-digit growth.
The diversity and scale of Intel products today puts us in a position to compete across the breadth of devices that compute and connect.
I’ll take just a moment to review each of these businesses before sharing my expectations for the rest of the year. Our newly formed Client Computing Group results reflected weakness in desktop demand and the depletion of PC supply-chain inventories. And while desktop volume declined, notebook volume grew year-over-year for the fifth consecutive quarter. Our silicon technology leadership remains a valuable competitive advantage, and the percentage mix of our latest 14 nanometer processors, the 5th Gen Core and Core M processor, is just ahead of our expectations.
In addition to launching the high volume, 5th Gen Core products at CES, the CCG Group also reached some important product milestones. We launched our newest Broadwell based vPro notebook SKUs that feature aspects of the Company’s No Wires vision to help us all work better. We also expanded our mobile product portfolio to adjust a range of price points and form factors. This includes the Intel Atom X5 and X7 for mainstream and premium tablet, formerly called, Cherry Trail, which is powering the new Microsoft Surface 3. We also started shipping the Atom X3, formerly SoFIA 3G, the Company’s first single-chip integrated baseband and apps processor, designed for entry in value-smartphones and tablets. This product was not even on our roadmap a year and a half ago, but is now launched in the market. This is a great example of the velocity of the new Intel.
In the Data Center, our manufacturing and architectural leadership combined with opportunities driven by the values of cloud-computing in each PC usages, continue to yield impressive results. DCG revenue grew 19% year-over-year and our Xeon E5 Version 3 product line, formerly known as Grantley platform, now represents more than 50% of our two-socket volume. New products like Grantley and our increased support of custom versions of the product helped us achieve record cloud revenue. And in the Telco segment, we continue to significantly outpace the market with the adoption of Intel architecture.
We also introduced our first Xeon based SoC processor, optimized for micro servers, storage, network and IoT devices. This product is an example of our strategy to reuse IT from our core business in complementary and profitable segments. Many of the secular turns underpinning our growth in the Data Center also benefited our NAND business, which grew 14% year-over-year.
Just three weeks ago, Intel and Micron, formally announced our jointly developed 3D NAND technology. Intel 3D NAND will be available in the second-half of this year, and offers roughly three-times the stated capacity of computing technologies, which aren’t expected until 2016. 3D NAND, for example, can provide greater than 10 terabytes of storage in a 2.5-inch solid state drive and is the first 3D NAND solution to be architected to be lower cost than 2D NAND. And finally, the Internet of Things Group grew 11% over the first quarter of last year, based on strength in the retail and digital security market segments.
Our first quarter results, combined with a variety of third-party insights from across the industry, and form our thinking for the balance of 2015. We expect the PC market to remain challenging, leading to a mid single-digit decline in the overall full year PC TAM. That said, we are excited about the launch of our 14-nanometer Skylake microprocessor and the capability that this product family will enable on a variety of operating systems. In particular, we are enthusiastic about the release of Windows 10 this summer, especially when combined with Skylake.
We continue to be confident in our strategy to drive growth. We're focused on innovating in our client business, improving mobile profitability and investing in and growing profitable adjacent markets. We are applying our process technology leadership, silicon integration expertise and the efficient use of shared intellectual property. This strategy is delivering results as evidenced by the growth we saw this quarter in the Data Center, IoT and NAND segments.
The performance of those businesses remains strong, and is expected to roughly offset weakness in [PC] [ph]. As we move forward, we will continue to work to ensure that it is smart and connected its best with Intel.
And with that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.
Stacy Smith
Thanks Brian. Revenue for the first quarter was $12.8 billion, flat year-over-year and in line with the downward revision to outlook provided on March 12. As a reminder, the change in revenue outlook was a result of weaker than expected demand from business desktop PCs and lower than expected inventory levels across the PC supply-chain. While the PC market was challenging in the first quarter, we continue to see strength in the Data Center, Internet of things, and NAND business.
First quarter gross margin of 60.5% was slightly above the original outlook provided on the January earnings call. Spending on R&D and MG&A was $4.9 billion, down $100 million from the fourth quarter and in-line with our guidance. Operating income of $2.6 billion was up 4% from a year ago. Earnings per share of $0.41 was up over 8% from a year ago.
The newly created Client Computing Group had revenue of $7.4 billion an 8% decline year-over-year, driven by a 16% decline in desktop unit volumes, partially offset by a 3% increase in notebook volumes. Tablet unit volumes were over 7 million units, up 45% year-over-year. We are on track to our annual goal of improving mobile profitability by $800 million with the majority of improvements to be realized in the back half of the year.
Operating profit for the overall Client Computing Group was $1.4 billion, down 24% from a year-ago. The decrease was driven primarily by lower desktop revenue and higher unit costs. The Data Center Group had revenue of approximately $3.7 billion, 19% growth on a year-over-year basis, driven by 15% unit growth. The Data Center Group had operating profit of $1.7 billion. This was up 27% year-over-year driven by unit growth, a richer mix and lower unit costs.
Additionally, year-over-year, Internet of Things segment achieved revenue growth of 11%, and the NAND business grew at a fast pace. The business continues to generate significant cash with $4.4 billion of cash from operations in the first quarter. We purchased $2 billion in capital assets, paid $1.1 billion in dividend and repurchased $750 million of stock in the first quarter.
Total cash balances, at the end of the quarter, is roughly $14 billion down approximately $5 billion from a year ago. Our net cash balances, total cash less debt is below $1 billion, and inclusive of our other longer-term investments, is more than $4 billion.
As we look forward to the second quarter of 2015, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $13.2 billion, up 3% from the first quarter. This forecast is in line with the average seasonal increase for the second quarter. We believe there was an inventory burn across the worldwide PC supply-chain in the first quarter and we expect a further reduction in inventory supply-chain levels in the second quarter in anticipation of Windows 10 launch in summer. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range to be 62%, plus or minus a couple of points, 1.5 point increase from the first quarter.
Turning to the full year 2015. We expect revenue to be approximately flat to 2014, down from the prior guidance mid-single-digit percentage growth. We’re now projecting a mid-single-digit decline in the overall PC market. We continue to forecast robust growth rates in the Data Center Group, Internet of Things Group and NAND businesses which we expect to offset the decline in the Client Computing Group. As a result of lower than expected demand and reduced growth rates this year, we are lowering capital spending, spending on R&D and MG&A. We are moving to reuse capital by rolling a forward to 14-nanometer and to align overall capacity with demand. We are now forecasting the midpoint of capital spending at $8.7 billion, down $1.3 billion from the prior outlook.
We are also forecasting the midpoint of our gross margin range of 61%, down 1 point from our prior guidance as a result of temporarily lower utilization rates and lower platform volumes. And we are forecasting the midpoint of R&D and MG&A spending for the year at $19.7 billion, down $300 million from the prior outlook.
We are prudently managing our cost capacity in inventory to address the changes in expected PC demand. We’re using our manufacturing leadership to transform the Company by developing leadership products across a broad range of end-markets. That product leadership is driving growth in revenue, profits, Data Center, Internet of Things and NAND businesses. We’ve illustrated this transformation. In the first quarter, almost 40% of our revenue came from the combination of these businesses and these businesses accounted for more than two-thirds of the Company’s overall operating profit in the first quarter. Our work is far from done, but the transformation of the Company is well underway.
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.
Mark Henninger
Thank you, Brian and Stacy. Moving on now to the Q&A as is our normal practice. We would ask each participant to ask one question and if you have it, just one follow-up. Jenny, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer
Stacy, my first question is, relative to your full year gross margin guidance of 61%, it sort of assumes that the back-half of the year is coming in around 61%. I am kind of curious given the revenue guidance implies a pretty steep ramp in back half of the year, i.e. utilization going up. Can you just help me understand why you wouldn’t get better leveraging gross margins in the second half?
Stacy Smith
You are doing the algebra correctly there. We’re averaging about 61% in the first-half, we’ve guided 61% for the year. And my expectation is the average over the back-half is in that range of about [inaudible]. You see some offsetting trends going on. So first, we do expect we’ll see some benefit associated with just seasonally stronger volume in the back-half of the year. Offsetting that is two things; one is, we’ll start to see -- we’re seeing 10-nanometer start-up cost today but they’ll ramp pretty significantly when we get into Q3 and Q4. So, that’s one element.
And then the other is, we’re bringing down the utilization rates on our 22-nanometer factory network and have now and through the Q2, maybe a little bit into Q3 those products will go into inventory and they will ship in the back-half of the year. And so we’ll see a little bit of elevated cost relative to what we thought in the back-half, associated with bringing down the utilization rates in the factory. You’ve watched us for a while, we do that so that we can free-up some capacity and roll it forward to 14-nanometer and offset some of the capital investment there. So, that’s why we’re doing it. But the impact of that is higher costs.
John Pitzer
And then just my follow-up Brian, there’s been sort of a lot of speculation in the press about potential M&A activity. And I doubt you can address specific speculation. But I am kind of curious, can you just step back and give us a sense of broadly what your acquisition strategy will look like, what areas do you feel like you need to augment? And importantly, as you think about use of cash, does any potential acquisition have to be more accretive than actually buying back your own stock?
Brian Krzanich
You're right, John, I am not going to comment on any of the rumors and all in the press. Our strategy on investing in this business or what we do with our cash hasn’t changed. And it’s really the same strategy that’s been before me and that is always first investment of business, firmly believe in that, and that investment, Moore’s Law, new architectures, technology, things like that and M&A at times and then share buybacks and dividends.
So those are always our priorities. We’re stewards of our shareholders’ cash and we always feel like that’s always the first thing we do. And if we can invest in the business and get a better return in that, then we do that, no matter how we can invest in that. But yes, I am not going to speculate on any of the rumors.
Stacy Smith
And just coming on the last part of your question, John, we -- as Brian said, our priority is to invest in the business first, dividend second, and then we use the buyback to modulate cash balances. We really don’t try to time the buyback to specific stock prices. We use it as the second mechanism to return cash to shareholders, that’s how we view.
Operator
The next question comes from Romit Shah from Nomura.
Romit Shah
Stacy, the revenue outlook for 2015, now it sort of assumes a similar recovery as your original guidance just off a lower base and back in early March, you talked about things like weaker business PC demand, the macro-environment and currency impact in the quarter. So, is it implicit in the new outlook that you think these issues will go away?
Stacy Smith
No, and maybe I am not completely grokking your question. We were projecting mid-single digit revenue growth for the Company on the back of a relatively flat PC unit demand. Now we’re projecting mid-single digit PC decline and that’s leading to relatively flat revenue growth year-on-year. But it has changed my view of your -- so maybe you can define your question a little better and I’ll try to answer little bit.
Romit Shah
Just to get to flat for 2015 it assumes pretty healthy sequential growth for the next couple of quarters. And I was wondering if the issues that hurt you in the first quarter do you see those issues becoming less of a headwind as we move through the year?
Stacy Smith
I understand your question, it’s about linearity. So yes, let me put the PC market in the context and we can go from there. Again, we’re expecting mid single digit decline overall in the PC market. We’re seeing a little bit of shift in linearity over the course of the -- we saw a fairly significant inventory burn in Q1. Normally in Q2, we would expect to see customer strive to put inventory in place for the back-half.
Our guide for Q2 is assuming that we’ll see a continued inventory burn in the quarter and that’s because of the timing of Windows 10, it’s sitting in the summer. And so what we think is going to happen is that our customers will lean-out inventory levels in the second quarter and then they’ll rebuild inventory levels in the third quarter. And if you do the math, it’s just a point or two of growth from the first half to the second half as a result to that in the quarter.
Romit Shah
As my follow-up, Brian, I was hoping you could elaborate on the $8.7 billion in CapEx and this idea of increased reuse of equipment. Is that just a repurposing of 22-nanometer? Does it at all impact the timing of 10-nanometer? Thank you.
Brian Krzanich
Sure, I think you’ve got it mostly right, each one of these product ramps or these technology ramps have a personality and a image on their own. And what you’re seeing, as we move through 2015, is just that. You did see that we shifted our overall view of the market from single digit growth to single digit decline, so that has one impact. You are seeing us be able to move more capital now as a result of that, plus I’ll give you some other things. Move more capital from 22-nanometers to 14-nanometers.
We also said that 14-nanometer, the ramps of our Broadwell products, are slightly ahead of our forecast. So we’re seeing a very nice migration of our product demand over to the 14-nanoemters. And we’re seeing some things like better yields, better utilization out of our 14-nanometer as it continues to get healthier. And so all of those combined have led us adjust our capital. So you’re seeing better utilization, better efficiency, but also the ability to move more 22-nanoemter capacity over the 14-nanometer.
Operator
The next question comes from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.
Joe Moore
Just wondering if you could talk about your inventory level kind of barely went up I guess $140 million sequentially despite being $900 million below where you thought you’d be on revenue. Can you just talk about how that transpired and how you thought maybe you’d have to work that inventory down in second quarter? Why isn’t there a little bit of an inventory overhang after the magnitude of the shortfall in Q1?
Stacy Smith
We were expecting inventory levels actually to come down in Q2, Joe, as Broadwell came down, so it wasn’t so much a unit comment as much as the dollar comment, but we expect the dollar values to come down because 14-nanometer costs are coming down the costs curve pretty steeply and we ended up top, so there is a -- from our perspective, a pretty significant shift. And then as we think about the rest of the year, we will -- as we said, we’ll bring utilization rates down on 22-nanometer, we’ll roll forward some of that capacity to 14-nanometer and we should bring inventory rates -- levels down by the time we get to the end of fall.
Joe Moore
Okay, great. And then my follow up, with regards to the buyback, how do you think about what the net cash level should be? Is there still a target of sort of I think you said historically you could feel comfortable at around zero net cash. And then how do you factor in any potential M&A into that equation? Does that mean that M&A would require to slow the buyback or just how should we think about those trade-offs, again not asking but any specific stories. But just how should we think about the balance sheet in that context?
Brian Krzanich
Its Brian, we're not going to answer any questions on M&A and those -- one of the speculations out there. In terms of net cash balances just we have said that we're targeting approximately zero net cash I also said it's impossible for me to manage it so tightly that we mathematically ever get to exactly zero. You can see we brought down cash balances a lot over the year and in Q1 we will serve $1 billion in net cash and when you include in some of the longer term portion of the portfolio we were pretty flat with $4 billion so it’s -- we're kind of comfortably where we want to be and comfortably where we communicated.

The next question comes from David Wong from Wells Fargo.
David Wong
Stacy given your comment about start-up charges for 10-nanometers towards the end of this year are you facing ahead of your original plan on 10-nanometers or are things tracking roughly according to what you expected?
Brian Krzanich
I can answer that one just form a technology standpoint. First we’ve said nothing about our timing of 10-nanometers. And we’ll give all of our timing for 10-nanometers at a later date. And the adjustments that talked about, does not have anything to be really with the 10-nanometer capital or spending or timing. So, they are completely disconnected.
David Wong
And given what -- you were saying on SoFIA. Do you expect to be incurring any contra revenues on tablet processor sales by the fourth quarter of this year? And can you give us some of idea as to how contra revenue payments might trend through this year?
Stacy Smith
Sure. And let me if I may, and let me just take it all the way up to the commitment Brian and I made around moving -- making $800 million improvement to the mobility portion. We are on track to that. There is two big buckets, if you will, one is the improvements in product margin and it's a combination of the cost structure we get with SoFIA and having a great product that’s targeted at the interim value segments of the phone and tablet market. And a chunk of it is the reduction in contra revenue dollars again the build materials around SoFIA we make it a competitive build materials cost. And so we are planning to pay contra revenue dollars associated with the SoFIA shipment.
SoFIA is not shipping in the market so on track from a timing standpoint Brian highlighted how fast we’re able to execute to this product line. And again it really is an example of the changes going on inside the Company. As I think about those playing out over the course of the year. Then the other big bucket is just reductions in investment level that we talked about at the Investor Meeting. That second bucket plays out kind of linearly across the air. It will grow but it’s giving us a benefit in each quarter. The product mix, SoFIA reduction in contra revenue dollars, really kicks-in in the back half of the year. So, it's more a back-end loaded of course based on the SoFIA ramp.

The next question comes from Harlan Sur from JP Morgan.
Harlan Sur
DCG was up 18% in 2014, it grew 19% here in Q1. I assume much of this growth was you cloud and Web 2.0 customers. As you think about the pipeline of cloud in HPC programs, are you anticipating continued strong spend here in Q2, or should we expect some lumpiness? How confident is the team about driving double-digits growth in DCG this year?
Brian Krzanich
Harlan, I’ll start the answer and then Stacy can jump in. So, we've always said in times when the growth is high or I’d assume the growth is a little bit less. But this tends to be lumpy. There are large cloud providers. They tend to come in with big bps and they’re purchasing. So don’t be surprised if there is a very high quarter and not as high. What we said though is that, overtime, we believe we can continue to grow this business at a mid double-digit -- mid-teens kind of growth rate, so 14%, 15%, 16%, somewhere in there, growth rate, over the rest -- several year of period moving forward.
We continue to have that view. We look at the products we’re bringing, the growth that we're seeing in cloud, cloud 2.0, as you say. Big Data is driving some of this growth as the cloud generates this data and the cloud providers realize it. They can utilize it to improve their cloud performance and their cloud offering. So, all of these things are working together and then that gives us confidence things that we can continue to grow this business segment.
Harlan Sur
And then the team started ramping its Core M product, just before the holiday season in discussions with your customers and partners. What's been the sell-through trend and uptake of 2-in-1 platforms to the holiday season and into the first half of the year? Just wondering what's the view on adoption and adoption rates with this form factor on a go forward basis? Thank you.
Brian Krzanich
As you said, Core M was introduced right before the holidays. I’d say that we had a limited number of SKUs available at holiday. And the amount of time we could get in front of it with marketing and all was limited as well. That said, we were very happy with the sales we saw in the holidays. Core M is really designed to provide the first truly fanless core product capability very soon and light form factors. As we’ve moved through the first quarter you’re starting to see a lot more. There are several designs that have come out during this quarter. The uptake has been good and we're continuing to market and make the product awareness.
As we move through this first half, you’re going to see a remainder of products come out on Core M that continue this thin light fanless device 2-in-1s. And so far the uptake has been very good. We think those, combined with our tablet offerings, provide a very -- lot of choices for the consumer in this mobile space. And then as we move through into the second half for the year, as we introduce Skylake, Skylake will have an additional Core M version which drives even the performance the battery life to the second generation for Core M. And again, we expect to see form factors, thin light, long better life fanless designs that are quite compelling.

The next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein.
Stacy Rasgon
I wanted to try to verify something, just so I understand it. So, is that gross margin is down in the second half were your 14-nanometer start ups are coming down, your revenues up a bunch, your tablet profit-loss is again lot worse, obviously you’ve 10-nanometer ramping. And you talked about reducing your 22-nanometer utilization in building inventory. So, that suggests that utilization has to be coming down a lot in the second half. You got to be building inventory a lot in Q2, but it's mostly 22-nanometers that you’ll then be selling in the second half when Windows 10 and Skylake are launching. Do I have those dynamics correct? And then what is the risk that you’re going to be building inventory I guess in the first half for Q2 that will be tougher to sale in the second-half given the new products that ought to be launching at that that point?
Stacy Smith
I think that the thing in that isn't accurate and is confusing…
Stacy Rasgon
Okay.
Stacy Smith
It is the inventory piece. So, what we're doing is in Q2, we're cutting the utilization rates of the 22-nanometer factories to avoid putting the product in it -- always bring it down, we’ve seen this -- some of this in the past, when we have downturn or an opportunity to roll forward capacity we want to do it, we certainly don’t want to put all the generation inventory into inventory if we can help it. But we're going to be cutting utilizations we're actually cutting them at the peak. The impact of that is we'll have some higher costs that are sitting in it because those products that we're producing in Q2 will sell through in Q3 and Q4, a little bit about cost headwind in the back half of the year. The utilization rates will bottom in Q2 and then we think to start to build backup because we'll take capacity offline on 22-nanometer. So build back in the back half.
Stacy Rasgon
So then why are you not calling out utilization as a negative margin driver for Q2 versus Q1, and gross margins are going up in Q2?
Stacy Smith
Because we're not cutting to the point that we have excess capacity charges, so what's happening is you will see production cost going up but that sits in inventory and it fills out in the back half. So that's why the way you will see it is a cost increase in the back half as opposed to a period charge in Q.
Stacy Rasgon
If you’re basically reducing it early and you’re taking the cost, it’s actually hitting your P&L and the back half. So you’re almost like smoothing your loadings in your margin outlook for the year. You’re taking Q2 up and taking the back half down versus prior guidance?
Stacy Smith
I would say, what we're doing is we're trying to react fast on bringing -- taking capacity offline and then rolling that forward and that was the same playbook we've had whenever we have a demand.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. Thanks. Can I ask my follow up?
Mark Henninger
I think we just covered it, Stacy, we’d like to….
Stacy Rasgon
Okay. Thank you.

The next question comes from Chris Danely from Citigroup.
Chris Danely
So, I guess just a hypothetical question on M&A then. Can you think of any scenario? I guess your previous biggest acquisition was McAfee, which was like 8 billion or something. Can you think of any scenario that would make you feel like you need it or want it or desired to do a $10 billion, $15 billion acquisition insurance like taking the company or a big product line or something like that? Will that ever come into play?
Brian Krzanich
Chris, I’ll give you that question back so let me give you the same answer which is we're not going to speculate on actual M&A questions, we’re not going to speculate on hypothetical questions.
Chris Danely
Okay, that's fine.
Brian Krzanich
But you can try a different one, if you want.
Chris Danely
That's okay. I'll stop for the line somewhat behind.
Brian Krzanich
You are not behind.
Chris Danely
Next one will be more mainstream, so if we kind of do the math on your revenue guidance, we get like, I guess, basically high single digit revenue growth for Q3 and Q4. You’ve talked about taking the PC gross rate down, so if we just look at straight desktop notebook that’s 58% of the business or something like that. So I guess, how can we get to high single-digit sequential revenue growth for Q3 and Q4 with the PC business a little slow, when I look at the last 10 quarters, Q3, Q4 in high single-digit revenue growth has only happened once, so just wondering how we can get to the math?
Brian Krzanich
I guess I’d say like, you’re seeing -- I would say not seeing anything unusual in the growth rates of DCG, IOTG, the memory business, they’re growing at a robust rate, we’re not expecting that to accelerate or decelerate in the back half. So just with the exception of DCG we had a higher than what our average is in Q1, so maybe that comes down a little bit. The little issue here is on the PC segment, we think we grew, we reduced inventories in Q1, what’s unusual is we’re predicting that we’re going to reduce the worldwide PC supply chain, we'll reduce inventories more in Q2. But think of that as you shift a few million units from Q2 and they get replenished in Q3 and that shifts when the billings happen, it’s not so much to comment on the end market. It’s just a comment on when inventories get built up for the backend foundry.
We think the driver there is Windows 10, it’s sitting in the summer and given that plus economic volatility and currency volatility we think customers will reduce inventory levels into the summer and then replenish back to kind of more normal rates after Windows 10 is available.
Operator
The next question comes from Christopher Rolland from FBR Capital Markets.
Christopher Rolland
So I’m thinking, my question is a little bit more big picture here. So PC industry volumes are now going to fall, probably mid single-digits along with you guys and some including myself believe that tablet volumes might also fall this year. So overall total compute units might in fact be flatter or perhaps falling this year. So I guess I’m trying to figure out what the missing piece here is. Are they really going to fall, is this a timing issue or is there something else here, is it PC lifespan for example that might be expanding, I know you guys track that. How do you look at it in terms of total computing and what’s going on here?
Brian Krzanich
I’ll start and Stacy can jump in as well. I think interestingly you're probably not too far, you said that the PC will be down mid single-digits, I would agree most people are thinking that tablets will likely be down, we’ve all heard a variety of forecasts, a little more difficult to forecast the tablet space. Just as a reference point, our tablet number for Q1 came in right online with what we had projected. So, and it’s up from our Q1 of 2014 significantly.
When we look at this for the full year and we look at compute there’s a variety of things that we look out, when we look out at this, there is share growth, there is -- what’s happening in compute and there’s also sell up as we continue to have newer and better performance as our products get better and better at the higher end especially and then look like the introduction of Core M and the number of people coming with entry level systems with Core M. You put all those together and that’s how we formed our view of this year. But as you said it is formed around a view that when you probably look at the total computes from those products it declined. We still think phones and tablets continue to grow and then there’s a growth in the data center, the growth in the Internet of Things and our memory business which will all grow in that teens kind of range and they’ll vary quarter-to-quarter.
Christopher Rolland
Also if you could address PC lifespan for example, if you do have specifics there? And then the other question I had was, a major bear thesis looking at least cash flow for Intel was around increasing cap intensity as we move down Moore’s law, but your CapEx guidance implies the lowest spend that we’ve had since 2010 and we’re pretty much on record revenue here. So in your opinion does this speak against that capital intensity argument or is this really just sort of a timing issue?
Brian Krzanich
Those are kind of two questions. Let me answer the first and I’ll let Stacy answer the capital intensity one. The first one was around what is happening to system longevity or system lifespan. Data is continuing to grow, our estimates are that there's something approximating 600 million PCs out there and that’s growing somewhat by the day that are greater than four years old. You could look at that as this is continuing to grow and push, you can also look at this as this is a great opportunity. And we still believe that at some point those systems will flip over. Windows 10, Skylake, all of those things are opportunities that we think we can start to move some of those units. But the approximation is 600 million of unit is greater than four years. So I'll let Stacy handle the capital intensity.
Stacy Smith
On the capital intensity I will give you the long-term answer and then come back to what we're seeing in 2015. The longer term answer and I'll refer you to some of the stuff we showed at the investor meeting. We do agree capital intensity is going to go up as measured by capital cost per square inch of silicon. We believe that through 14, 10 and with some insight all the way down the 7 nanometer we can offset that increase in capital cost per square inch of silicon by improving our density. And so we can keep the cost per transistor coming down at the historical close.
So for us we don’t think that we're going to be impacted by at least over the next two to three generations by the increase in capital intensity. And that’s what I showed at the investor meeting there is kind of this $7 billion to $8 billion normalized run rate where we can respond to some unit growth with manufacturing CapEx and on top of that we put some other capital things across this building, fabs and specific then to what's happening this year is we were planning for -- if you all look back to the investor meeting last year we've seen two big buckets of improvement, one is as Brian said our confidence around 14 nanometer has improved and second our desktop units have come down and so versus flat, I think we're down in the mid single-digits. And the combination of those two things has allowed us to have more reuse for 22 nanometer or 40 nanometer. And we've driven some efficiency in the factory network. And so I'd characterize this as being an unusually low level of CapEx relative to the size of the business because we're driving efficiency at a faster rate and we are getting more reuse than we expect.
Operator
The next question comes from Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs.
Jim Covello
Guys you've talked about how the mobile losses declined in the back half of the year that was very helpful color. Could you talk a little bit about the strategy or the thought process behind combining the categorization of the groups and the reporting structure? What was the thought there?
Brian Krzanich
Sure I'll start Jim and Stacy can voice in some of this as well because there is financial side to this. But in general we first made this move based on our customers and how we look at the architecture in the business. So our customers you walk into whoever that customer is Lenovo, Acer or some of the ODMs, they look at the platform from the phablet especially up through at least the tablet and instead of low end entry level PC whether it be a window based system or Chromebook or Android. They look at all of those platforms as the same type of hardware. And they want to have a single group that they interface with and so our customers wanted this.
Secondly from an engineering perspective from our side, the silicon, the cost improvement, the software work, the drivers all of those things again a lot of overlaps. So by driving these two organizations together we are getting efficiencies, that are helping contribute to that $800 million cost reduction that Stacy and I've committed to. So it was first and foremost our customers and our efficiency were driven by this. This is not anything else. At that point then Stacy, what he does is that the financials need to represent how you're running the business and making decisions by it. So we also made the reporting structure that same way, but I'll let Stacy jump on that.
Stacy Smith
I think Brian said the only two pieces of commentary I would add to that I'll take you back to Chris's question earlier. We're seeing this blurring of lines between different devices and we were doing some unnatural things to try to categorize them. I think the Microsoft Surface is a perfect example of that. When you look at partners in IDCs, where they characterize the market, they count that as a tablet. We were including that in the PC revenue line and we've realized that the customer is reviewing this as one category of devices, we wished manages as one category devices and we would be more efficient and more accurate I think of client broadly.
The other comment I make is, as we showed in the investor meeting and Brian had some specific materials on this. We're also finding that the IP that we were developing was shared across these different groups. So again we were having to categorize things that ultimately came down to judgments and we realized it was one set of customers one set of products and one set of IP that we're playing across the different products.
Jim Covello
Follow up would be on the NAND market. I know what you said, NAND is going to fall on same secular trends as DCG. Is there ever going to be a time period where it makes sense to expand that opportunity for you? It's a good growth market, you're making good margins on it those up to factories. What would be the pros and cons of expanding your business in that segment?
Brian Krzanich
First you're right Jim. As we said at our colors Jim especially for us because the majority of the NAND that we sell goes into enterprise level products mainly the data centre greater than 50% of what we sell in the net half the NAND is in enterprise class device. We also announced our 3D NAND, which we think really is a game changer. We talked about the density, the cost, putting 10 terabytes or more into an SSD, we think is pretty compelling. And we’re constantly looking at these businesses, the NAND especially and asking ourselves what are the level of investments.
Right now we have a great partnerships with Micron where we jointly developed these, the majority of the manufacturing is done, all the manufacturing on these technologies is done by them, and that relationship works very well. We’re able to invest and invest through them and there you have the efficiency of having factories that they can offset loadings with other products that they have and it's a very efficient model in the memory market to have basically two companies with two very different business models to be officially using the same factories network.
What would drive us outside that? Would be if we start some unique growth or some unique situation to where it make sense for us to manufacture. But right now this model works very well and efficiency that we get out of working together with them, I think is really what has been a game changer in the market for us.
Operator
The next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava from Bank of Montreal.
Ambrish Srivastava
I just had two questions one on the DCG, you’ve referenced a 50% for Xeon E5 if I remember correctly on Grantley. Just help us understand, what has that done in terms of driving growth so far for the business? And my second question, my follow-up is on the PC side Brian. You have mentioned Windows 10 a couple of times, are you expecting a big bump up in demand from that? And if so why?
Brian Krzanich
So, we’ll into these one at a time and let me start with the Grantley one, as Stacy can voice in for the Window 10. In all of these cases, our new products as you said the Grantley platform which is our E5 series of products provides a new level of performance and when you look at this business there are some segments of this business that’s replacement with each one of these new generation we look at the fact that the total cost of ownership for a cloud provider, an enterprise provider to come in and do a replacement from an older generation Intel product to a new generation Intel product tends to have a positive total cost of ownership return.
It has a replacement function not each one of these new generations have a lot of which the increased density in performance that a cloud provider can get with a new product like the Grantley allows them to grow their business without having to grow their footprint as much. And so that allows cloud growth at a much more efficient and effective capacity. So if we look at new platforms like Grantley, the fast we do get a very fast transition as we said greater than 50% now is on Grantley. It's just an example of how fast people see the economics that these products deliver. So that would be my answer to this, it's really performance which then drive economics, which then drive both replacement and overall data center growth. Stacy had a comment on that.
Stacy Smith
Just -- activity in the place you see it is in our mix and this is a place where if we can drive technology faster than everybody else we get paid for it because as we bring more powerful products then people buy higher in the stack because they get an increasing return on that. And when you look at the DCG results year-on-year you see that units were up 15%, ASP was up 5%. So you see it in both of those that drives this replacement cycle and it drives in increasing mix.
Ambrish Srivastava 
I guess what I was trying to get to, sorry Stacy, what I wanted to get to is how much of the growth is -- are you able to handicap on the number, how much is that growth came from the Grantley?
Stacy Smith
So how much of the 19% growth was due to Grantley? We don’t go through and put those things on separations. Primarily as we said, the growth in Grantley in general, tends to be lumpy and it's based on orders by some of the big cloud providers. And as we said, more than 50% of the volume is now on Grantley. So just by the math you’d say sure, so there is more than 50% of the 19% growth was probably on Grantley, but I am not sure as necessarily that factor driving this, it's one of the factors.
Brian Krzanich
Keep in mind, we bring out a new product in the data center every 12 months and then that product rolls out over the course of a year, right. So, Grantley has been shifting for since -- been shipping since Q3 of last year and it started in the cloud. So it's not like an event, it's you bring out a product and starting a segment and we bring out products that are appropriate to different segments and we bring out a new micro architecture, and then we bring out the second generation of micro architecture. So it's always a product evolution happening in this.
Stacy Smith
With regards same question as we said in the script and in some of these questions, we're not really, currently forecasting a big recovery or boom in second half. What we said is there is some push out of the inventory that would normally be present in second quarter. As people mean that so that they're in preparation for Windows 10, so Windows 10 Launch is in the summer as it's been announced. As that occurs and we move into Q3, we anticipate that inventories will simply recover back to a normal level and that leaned out, and so we’ll see growth in that inventory recovery at that point. But if you took a look at the sell through and our overall year we’re actually projecting as we said relatively seasonal mid single-digit decline in the PC business and we’ve just got this inventory shifts on a moving in the center of the near allowance that.
Operator
The final question comes from C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI.
C.J. Muse
I guess first question on the PC side in terms of the single-digit decline. Curious if you could walk through what assumptions you’re marking around mixed shift from enterprise to consumer ASPs as well as the impact of U.S. dollar strength?
Brian Krzanich
It’s a tough one, so I’ll start with the second part, it’s really impossible to detangle what we’re seeing in the PC market and separate out what’s happening from a macroeconomic standpoint, a currency volatility kind of XP hangover and then Window 10 shift is just kind of all wrapped up together. So I don’t think I can give you a lot of color on that. Our view of the year when we started the year is that we would see particularly a little less strength in the enterprise segment of the market and the little less weakness in the consumer segment of the market. I think we revised that statement now to say we’re going from strengthen in the enterprise segment to probably little bit of weakness in the enterprise segment and consumer was weak last year as prior little less weak this year, but expected to be down and you take the combination of two things and I’ll tell you that’s a minus 5% kind of mid single-digit decline.
C.J. Muse
And again as a follow-up, in terms of the cut for CapEx curious if this is a new steady state for you guys. And then I guess as the question that follows that, how do we think about impact to construction in progress if it all? And then as well wouldn’t we go down to 10 nanometer the rising cap intensity there do we see a stair-step higher in terms of that number and depreciation or how should we think about those moving parts?
Brian Krzanich
So let me start and then I’ll let Stacy jump in. What we said was that this year’s capital is a little bit less than what we would have normally projected for the year. We were able to get as we said better yields better utilization and we’re able to -- and this happens from time-to-time. You can look back at our past it happened in the '08, '09 and from there we get that there is a slight increase in our projections for total volume at the same time we're going to a transition we’re able to move capital very-very quickly.
One other things we’ve made as an improvement within cloud, our ability to shift capital from 1 million to another very quickly and that has all to do with the copy exactly and how we design our architectures and technologies to be able to reduce. That said again separate out capital intensity of a technology with the absolute unit cost of a technology. And the real fundamental of Moore's Law is one is economic and on the 58th Anniversary of Moore's Law which this year is we should remember that Moore's Law is an economic law and that we’re going to reduce the cost as well as we’re improving the performance of these parts.
So we believe the 10 nanometer, yes that capital per wafer start does go up but it goes up less than the density does and so we believe our unit costs and when we measure that in transistor costs which is probably the best way to measure one-to-one or our overall product cost on a same day equivalent is what skylight part on one technology of the other. We get an improvement in that cost greater than the capital intensity.
So the bottom line is I don’t expect this always to have this lower level CapEx. That said we’re continuously trying to reduce and be as efficient in CapEx as we can just the capital intensity will go up in some nanometers where we’ve got them, we feel like it goes up less but as we say it goes up less than density and cost improvements of the product.
All right thank you all for joining us for today. Jamie please go ahead and wrap up the call.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Intel Corporation Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your patience. We do apologize for the delay as we were experiencing a technical issue. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]
As a reminder, today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mark Henninger.
Mark Henninger
Thank you, Jamie. And welcome everyone to Intel’s fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call. By now you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with it. If you have not received both documents, they are available on our Investor website, intc.com.
I am joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO; and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we will hear brief remarks from both of them, followed by the Q&A.
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today’s discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.
Also during this call, we use any non-GAAP financial measures or references, we will post the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliation to our website, intc.com.
So, with that, let me hand it over to Brian.
Brian Krzanich
Thanks, Mark. The fourth quarter marked a strong finish to a great year. We began 2014 expecting roughly flat year-over-year revenue and operating income. Instead, the company’s full year revenue grew 6% setting an all-time record of $55.9 billion. At the same time, operating income rose 25%.
When I became CEO, I set two imperatives for the company. First, develop a more outside-in view markets to ensure we go to where the markets are heading. And second, increase our velocity or piece of innovation in a purposeful direction. Over the last year, we made meaningful progress against these imperatives, which helped us meet and exceed many of our top goals. I’d like to take a moment to review the year.
In the PC Client Group, our goal was to stabilize the PC business. We expected revenue to be down by a low single-digit percentage and for operating profit to be roughly flat year-over-year.
Instead, the year closed with a 4% increase in revenue and a 25% increase in operating profit. Our focus on reinventing the computing experience and leaving no segment unserved from a low-end to the high-end contributed to these results.
We launched Broadwell on the world’s first 14-nanometer manufacturing processor. While we did have some start-up challenges that contributed to roughly six-month delay, yields have steadily improved.
The end result is a family of Core M and fifth-generation core processor that are the foundation for the industries most compelling new designs. These designs include the thinnest, lightest and most energy efficient notebooks, 2-in-1s, Ultrabooks, Chromebooks and mini PCs.
We began the year with high expectations for the Data Center Group. We said we would capitalize on the growth of the cloud and big data by diversifying customer segments and product leadership.
We initially forecasted revenue growth in the low to mid teens, with operating profit growing faster than revenue. We exceeded those high expectations and grew revenue 18%, while operating profit expanded by a remarkable 31%.
In the Mobile and Communications Group, we set a goal to ship into 40 million tablets in 2014. This goal is intended to establish Intel architecture in the marketplace and scale the supply chain and attract developers.
I’m pleased to report that we shipped into 46 million tablets, becoming one of the industries largest merchant silicon providers in tablets. We also began shipping our second-generation LTE baseband known as 7260.
We are proud that the company reached these milestones. We have more work ahead of us. Our key goal for mobility is to improve profitability. To that end, we just qualified the first SoC in our SoFIA lineup. SoFIA is a low-cost integrated application processor and baseband chip.
As it ramps, it will progressively reduce the bill of material costs that have adversely affected our gross margins in the mobile business. We also struck landmark agreements with Rockchip and Spreadtrum to expand the development and distributions of IA products performing in hardware.
Similarly, we grew other adjacent businesses by using IP from our core products. For example, our Internet of Things Group grew 19% through 2014, passing the $2 billion mark for the first time. The recently launched RealSense 3D camera technology is another example of extending our IP.
RealSense is redefining imagining in a variety of computing devices. It’s also making its way into all sorts of new and unanticipated applications, highlighting the value of taking outside-in view, investing ahead of churn and shaping nascent technology.
Finally, you see us moving quickly to wearables through our growing portfolio of collaborations with world-class fashion and fitness brands, like Fossil, Oakley, Opening Ceremony and SMS Audio, along with our own products like the Basis Peak and the Curie Module, a computer the size of a button.
Intel is in a very different place today than we were just 12 months ago. We are participating in a broader range of devices, but we are innovating in emerging segments. These are the trend we’ll build on in 2015, bringing us closer to our vision that if it’s smart and connected, it is best with Intel. Our work isn’t done, but our progress against our imperatives leads us increasingly confident in our strategy.
With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.
Stacy Smith
Thanks Brian. To reiterate what Brian said, the fourth quarter was a strong finish to a great year. Revenue of $14.7 billion was a record for the company and was up 6% from a prior year. The strength of our product portfolio can be seen in our gross margin of over 65% and in our profitability.
Operating income grew 25% and earnings per share, which also benefited from the passage of the R&D tax credit grew 45% from a year ago. From a market perspective, we saw nice unit and revenue growth in the PC Client Group segment, with revenue up 3% and operating profit up 18% on a year-over-year basis.
The Data Center Group benefited from the build out of the cloud, data analytics and our strong product portfolio. This business achieved 25% revenue growth and 39% profit growth year-over-year.
The company saw modest increase in net inventory levels quarter-over-quarter as we are efficiently managing capacity, while ramping Broadwell on 14-nanometer. And the worldwide PC supply chain appears to be healthy, with inventory levels appropriate as we enter the first quarter.
These results for the fourth quarter completed a strong year for Intel. Recapping the 2014 financials, for full year 2014, revenue of $55.9 billion was up 6%, operating income of $15.3 billion was up 25% and earnings per share of $2.31 was up 22% from 2013.
Gross margin of approximately 64% in 2014 is up about 4 points from 2013. Spending on R&D and MG&A was $19.7 billion in 2014, up $1 billion from 2013, driven primarily by increased R&D spending and higher profit dependent spending. In 2014, both our PC business and our Data Center business outperformed our expectations at the start of the year.
PC Client Group revenue grew by 4%. We saw PC Client Group platform volumes grow 8% from a year ago and inclusive of tablets, we saw 18% unit growth. Operating profit for the PC Client Group segment was up 25% over the same horizon.
We saw robust growth in our Data Center business with 8% unit growth leading to 18% revenue growth from 2013 and operating profit growth of 31%. Additionally, in comparison to 2013, the Internet of Things segment achieved revenue growth of 19% and Software and Services Operating segment was up slightly, our NAND business grew at vast pace and although revenue was down for the Mobile and Communications Group, we grew share in tablets.
The business continued to generate significant cash with $20.4 billion of cash from operations in 2014. Total cash balance at the end of the year was roughly $14.1 billion, down approximately $6 billion from a year ago.
We purchased $10.1 billion in capital assets, down from our prior outlook of $11 billion, as we found efficiencies, optimize the manufacturing network and increased our factory utilization.
In addition, we paid $4.4 billion in dividends. In November, we announced dividend increase to $0.96 per share on an annual basis effective for the first quarter of 2015. We repurchased about $10.8 billion of stock in 2014, up from $2.1 billion in 2013.
Our net cash balance total cash less debt is approximately $340 million and inclusive of our other longer term investment is more than $4 billion. This is down by over $5.5 billion from the start of the year.
As we looked forward to the first quarter of 2015, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range to $13.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million, down about 7% from the fourth quarter. This forecast is in line with the average seasonal decline for the first quarter. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range for the first quarter to be 60%, plus or minus a couple of points.
Consistent with the business drivers discussed in the November Investor Meeting, the 5 point decline from the fourth quarter is primarily driven by higher platform unit costs on 14-nanometer products, higher factory start-up costs and lower platform volumes.
Turning to full year 2015, we are planning for revenues to grow in the mid-single digits. We are forecasting the midpoint of our gross margin range at 62%, plus or minus a couple of points. We are forecasting R&D and MG&A spending for the year at $20 billion, plus or minus $400 million and we are forecasting capital spending of $10 billion, plus or minus $500 million.
2014 was a great year and the financials demonstrate our strategy and action as we enter 2015. First, we are growing again across a broad range of products and markets.
Second, we continue to invest in our core competitive advantages of leadership IP and leadership manufacturing. These competitive advantages are becoming increasingly valuable and increasingly rare.
Third, we are in a great position to benefit from the build out of the cloud and data analytics as we enter 2015. We expect these trends to drive growth again this year.
And last, we continue to execute our strategy of both investing in our business and also generating return for our shareholders via the dividend and the buyback.
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.
Mark Henninger
Okay. Thank you, Brian and Stacy. Moving on to the Q&A, as is our normal practice, we would ask each participant to ask one question and just one follow-up if you have one. Jamie, please introduce our first questioner.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Danely from Citigroup.
Chris Danely
Thanks guys. And Brian, in all sincerity, congratulations on a great year for yourself and the company. I guess the first question is on gross margins. Can you just talk about, I guess for Stacy, the trend in gross margins after Q1 and embedded in that, do you think that the second half’15 gross margins can be equal to the second half of ‘14 gross margins and for this year assuming something close to normal? Can we assume gross margins would be up in 2016 on an apples-to-apples basis?
Stacy Smith
Hi, Chris. This is Stacy. Yeah. I am -- I will just start this way. See I’m not going to forecast 2016 gross margins in January of ‘15. We will probably talk about those in November. So you are getting a little ahead of me.
In terms of the -- what’s happening in the gross margin, it’s very consistent with what we talked about in the November Investor Meeting. And to be -- to specifically answer your question, yes, I expect that the second half gross margins will be back above the midpoint, we forecasted 62% for the year, we are at 60% in Q1, I think the second half will be above that midpoint, the first half will be below. This is all I told you in November.
The big drivers for us here are 14-nanometer. As 14-nanometer becomes a larger mix of our products, we are mixing up in terms of our costs. That is higher than normal and beginning of the year and then it will come down and catch-up to prior technologies by the time we get into the back half.
We have some increase in start-up costs and then we will get some good news associated with getting back some of the impact associated with tablets. So we get back about half of the impact from 2014 and into 2015.
In terms of whether that will match the back half of 2014, I’d say, the only thing that I’d point to you is 2015 is the year where we have startup costs. So, that’s going to be an overhang through the year and our cadence is kind of every other year. So, probably adjusted for that, we are going to be in the same kind of range.
Chris Danely
Great. And then for my follow-up, question for Brian, just on the MCG business, so Brian, I guess, we’re still losing a little more than a $1 billion a quarter, but you said that those losses will go down. Any color you can provide on that, anything you can give us in terms of your overall goals or goals for the mobile business this year, either in units or profitability or anything else there?
Brian Krzanich
Sure. Sure, Chris. So what we said for 2015, so if you remember, step back in 2014, we said, look, we have to go out and establish our footprints here. We have to get ourselves known in this market, be considered a serious player and get the developers attracted, both the hardware and software developers interested in IA and so that’s we said.
We now set a goal, a unit level goal. So we knew we were serious and we brought parts that were not necessarily design for this segment and plus with the BAM costs deltas came from.
For 2015, we feel like we’ve done a very nice job now of establishing ourselves, we are one of the top producers of silicon in this segment. And our goal right now is from a unit perspective is, we think we can just grow roughly at what the market will grow for tablets. So we don’t need to go out and necessarily outpace the market or anything like that for this year from a growth perspective.
Instead, we are going to focus on two segments and that is, one, as you just said, getting our cost profiles down, making it, so that we are much more cost effective and then as a result getting a loss out. And Stacy and I committed to drive $800 million out of this business for ‘15. We believe we have a solid plan to go do that. That’s based on a couple of things. One, part of this reorganization was to drive efficiency, to get to consistency across the platform, to be utilized and to get the efficiency of people, of hardware, of software from all of that.
The other one is as we move into the second half of this year, especially SoFIA, which we said was designed for this segment and has no BAM out there or difference, nearly starts to ramp and you saw we’ve already internally qualified our first SoFIA, the 3G version. We said that, the next version, the LTE version would be in the first half of next year and they will ramp through the year. So as those come in, they take a lot of that cost delta out and that’s we are fairly -- feeling fairly good about the $800 million.
The other place, you saw the Dell Venue 87000 is a great example, was one best of innovation at CES and best of show at CES and it’s showing a thinnest tablet with real innovation at a $399 price, where people can start to make money in the tablet space a little bit now again. And so we think the combination of right products plus real innovation like that will allow us to make real progress.
Chris Danely
Thank you.

The next question comes from Mike McConnell with Pacific Crest Securities.
Mike McConnell
Thank you. Looking at the balance sheet, Stacy, there was a pretty significant spike in receivables in Q4 and DSOs look like they are pretty elevated relative to levels we’ve seen in the last couple of years? Could you kind of explain what was going on there with the receivables?
Stacy Smith
Sure. And actually, I think DSOs still are in a healthy range, but the timing -- the quarter was a little bit more backend loaded than Q3 was and so we ended the quarter with more receivables. It was as simple as that. We started with -- we didn’t have a terribly strong October and the quarter strengthened as we went through.
Mike McConnell
Okay. Great. And then just looking at linearity for DCG, given you’ve got a new product family, we’ve got operating system from Microsoft, that’s going to be expiring this year? Could you give us any color on how we should expect linearity on a quarterly basis for DCG this year, if it will be any different than what we see in the past?
Stacy Smith
So, yeah, I think, we always caution you that the PC market, I think, we have data that says, it behaves roughly seasonal. With DCG, you have to be careful, because you have five to 10 very large cloud customers that based on their buying patterns can really change the quarter-to-quarter trend. So I tend to hesitate to tie to much to seasonal in DCG.
When you look at the results over the course of 2014, it was robust unit growth. It was great revenue growth, 18% revenue growth. As we said in the Investor Meeting, we think that the underlying trends that are driving that continue into ‘15 and we put a forecast out there that said in excess of 15% growth, that’s what we still think.
Mike McConnell
Thank you.
Operator
The next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital Markets.
Ambrish Srivastava
Hi. Thank you. Brian, I just wanted to continue with the question on the mobility side. Based on the drivers that you laid out, should we than expect that the recovery in the operating losses should be more backend loaded? And then, you mentioned that tablets you expect to grow with the end market and most, at least, I’ll speak for myself, we expect almost no growth? So is that how you guys are thinking about the tablet market? And then I had a quick follow-up for you, Stacy?
Brian Krzanich
Sure. So let me give you how we view the market and then I’ll ask Stacy talk about how the $800 million is laid out through the year and then you can talk about the margins too. I’ve seen forecast that are at or near zero as you say. I’ve seen forecast that are a slight decline. I’ve seen forecast that have, I’ll say tend a low teen growth in tablets and it’s kind of varied as the fourth quarter went through even. So that’s why we’ve kind of said, we’ll grow at the rate that the market does.
I don’t think I want to necessarily shrink. So unless the market shrink significantly I think we would then probably try and target more of a flattish. But in general, I think, saying that we’re going to grow, our market tells you, I’m going to try and outgrow the market, is the message I’m trying to send. And whether its minus 5, zero or plus 5 to 10, I call that -- all of that kind of flattish to grow with the market.
Stacy Smith
Yeah. And on the linearity of the $800 million improvement, there is really at the highest level three things that are improving our profitability this year. So first is bringing SoFIA into the product mix, that helps us both from the standpoint of the SoC cost that SoFIA has and the contra revenue dollars associated with the bill of material offset that we’ve been providing, which we don’t plan to provide with SoFIA. That is backend loaded. We’re bringing SoFIA into the product family kind of as we speak, but it becomes really significant volume for us when we get into the back half.
The second one is the LTE -- the ramp of LTE to offset some of the investments we’ve been making there. That ramp is underway now, but I would expect the back half volume to be higher than the first half. So that also is a little bit more backend loaded.
And then the third is, as we’ve said, we’re shifting the investment profile and that’s more linear across the year. So those are the three items and two of those three does put more of the improvement in the back half.
Ambrish Srivastava
Okay. Thank you. And my quick follow-up for you, Stacy, is on the capital allocation side, last couple of quarters, you did a great job, brought back a lot of stock, but now if I look at the onshore versus offshore on the balance sheet, there is just a $2 billion delta? Could you remind us in the -- in terms of the cash flow generated, how much is onshore versus offshore and then the ramifications for stock buyback? Thank you.
Stacy Smith
Sure. It varies year-by-year depending on where we’re -- remember we actually invest in factories around the world. So a lot of the onshore versus offshore will vary based on where we’re starting up factories. But the majority of our cash generation is in the U.S. We do generate a lot of cash and we certainly have the ability to use that for any corporate purposes including a buyback.
Ambrish Srivastava
Thank you.
Brian Krzanich
Thanks, Ambrish.
Operator
The next question comes from Jim Cabello with Goldman Sachs.
Jim Cabello
Great and thanks so much for taking the question. First question, Stacy, I see the CapEx is shifting around a little bit, anything significant there or are you just able to find a little bit of the ability to save some money?
Stacy Smith
Yeah. I would term it as a fairly significant reduction in CapEx for ‘14 and we brought down till we brought the CapEx for ‘15 down to the bottom of the range. And it’s a variety of things when I look at the savings we had in ‘14. About half of it was due to, I call basic blocking and tackling. We’re able to negotiate some overpricing. We had some non-capacity related projects that we’re able to push out of the year and we’re always looking for those opportunities. And I think the manufacturing organization did a great job of finding them.
And then about half of it is, as we progressed over the course of 2014, we learnt a couple of things. One is our confidence in yields and our yield forecast went up, that’s what we showed you in the November investor meeting.
Secondly, the manufacturing organization demonstrated the ability to startup factories more quickly than we had assumed at the beginning of the year. And the combination pf that allowed us to shift out the third HVM 14-nanometer factory that starts up now kind of mid-15, out by two to three months and that doesn’t sound like a lot but given how capital intensive those factories are that actually gives us a much more capital efficient ramp and we’re able to generate some savings as a result of it.
Jim Cabello
That’s helpful. Thank you. And as a follow-up, Brian, I mean, could you just on the highest level maybe give us a sense of how you think the PC market stands today entering 2015 compared to how it was entering 2014? Some of the ODM data would suggest we exited 2014 a little weaker but that may just be a function of that weak October that Stacy had mentioned in terms of linearity and things. Maybe it really is more similar than we thought, even though the quarterly data isn’t quite as good in ‘14 as it was in ‘13 but maybe if you could offer your perspective there? Thank you.
Brian Krzanich
Yeah. So I’m not sure of all of your statistic is throughout there, Jim, but let me just give you a kind of our view of the PC market. I think, when we look at Q4 and then again, as you look at ‘14 overall, it was a various target played out exactly as we forecasted and predicted. And Q4 ended up being very much a seasonal quarter. We saw demand in the more mature markets, stronger especially on the consumer side than in the emerging markets.
And as Stacy mentioned, our inventories as we exit Q4, we’re very comfortable with where the inventories are. So remember, as we entered -- exited Q3 and kind of entered Q4, there might have been -- there are some concern there might have been a little inventory, we feel like we’ve burnt that off to the system, especially a lot of that was down at the low end. And as we exit Q4, we’re very comfortable with the inventory.
From me as I look out into now ‘15, I look at it and say, okay, we’ve got Core M, which has just really hit the market as we entered into the holiday season. It’s our great thin fanless 2 in 1 devices at all price points that I believe will stimulate usage there. We’ve got the Broadwell-U, which is a first as a really the high volume Broadwell. Just hitting the market, we’ve got something dozen systems in Q1 that will be coming out on Broadwell. You saw us introduce RealSense at CES.
We have, I think seven or eight systems in the first quarter coming out with RealSense and that combination. So I look at the amount of innovatio,n all of the OS’ were on and availability and really optionality that consumer has for OS or an enterprise. And the price point, you’ve got PCs from Chromebook starting at $199, Windows Systems $249 all the way up from there to the real innovative systems like Sprout. I look at it and say that the innovation and the options of the PC market have never been better.
So I am feeling pretty good about where we are in the PC market. If you remember our forecast is based even still on flat units and a slight decrease in ASP. So we are still, even though I’ve told you all of this innovation and there is that. We’ve still been relatively conservative and said, it’s a flat unit year and a slight decline even in ASPs given that.
Stacy Smith
And if I could just emphasize one point on Q4. I think we’ve characterized it as pretty normal from an in-demand standpoint. We under shipped demand some in Q4, so there was inventory burn. But we now think it happened as we look back, as there was a bit of inventory, particularly Bay Trail lower end systems. When we started the quarter that led to some weakness in the first few weeks and then it caught back up as we worked our way through the quarter and burn through that inventory and then we saw it behave a bit normally from the shipment pattern.
Jim Cabello
Truly helpful, guys. Thanks so much and good luck.
Brian Krzanich
Thanks Jim.
Operator
The next question comes from David Wong from Wells Fargo.
David Wong
Thanks very much. You talked about blocking and testing to bring down CapEx but your $10 billion 2014 CapEx and then your 2015 plan is almost a billion below $10.7 billion to $11 billion in every year 2011 to 2013. So are you actually on a permanently higher level of capital efficiency? And if that’s the case, what would your long-term CapEx as a percent of revenue be?
Brian Krzanich
No, I’ll say, David, this, -- the fact that we were at $10 billion in ‘14 and we are at $10 billion in ‘15 doesn’t change my long-term view for -- if you think about what I showed in the investor meeting. I showed that we’ve kind of in between $10 billion and $11 billion. We are at the low end of that for a couple of years. I still think that’s the right range for us. Within that two-thirds to three quarters is manufacturing capacity related and then the rest is non-manufacturing CapEx.
David Wong
Okay. Great. And when do you expect to offer 10-nanometer capability to foundry customers?
Brian Krzanich
We are timing on 10-nanometers. We are not going to come out with when we’ll be introducing a 10-nanometer to the marketplace in general, probably until the end of this year. So again as we go through the year probably by the investor meeting in November, we’ll give you an outlook on how and what timing is for 10-nanometers.
David Wong
Thanks very much.
Operator
The next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Sanford Bernstein.
Stacy Rasgon
Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I think first, I just want to -- it sounds like the slightly weaker PC volume you saw in Q4 is not changing your 2015 of the market at all. If the inventory burn that you saw in the channel was at the low end, we saw ASPs come up I guess because you were losing some of that low-end shipment. What does that suggest for your ASP trend next quarter as potentially those -- I guess, Stacy, after you see those inventory trends going back the other way and what does that mean for pricing as we move into next quarter? Does the low end start to come back for you?
Brian Krzanich
Yes. Well, I will take that. First of, I’ll say that the ASP good news that we saw in Q4 really had three elements to it. One element was the fact that we saw some inventory burn on Bay Trail. So our mix within, notebooks was a little bit higher. Think of that in rough numbers that’s about a third of it. And about two thirds of it is associated with server. We just had a very strong quarter in terms of server and our server mix is starting to look better, starting to improve some.
So that’s about two-thirds of it. In terms of the impact on Q1, it’s not jumping out on the margin recon. So you should take from that. They were expecting pretty benign ASP environment as we go into the year, and it also doesn’t pop out on the year recon. So it’s not a big driver of gross margin next year based on what we can see today.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. And so my follow-up, I want to ask maybe more general question on 14 versus 22. So for 14-nanometers, you’ve shown a lot of charts showing normalized cost per transistor dropping below trend. Obviously wafer cost is going up quite a bit, but your density seems to be increasing even faster and that’s going down. But that’s a normalized basis. At the same time, we’ve had yields and obviously you have taken a bit longer to get into place. We have factory ramps that seem to be hitting more than normal in the first half of the year. Would you say that the all-in costs of the lifetime of 14-nanometers is actually is going to turn out to be lower than the all-in cost of 22?
Brian Krzanich
Hey, Stacy. I would take you back to the graph I showed at the investor meeting because I actually a non-normalized cost that showed Broadwell relative to other products at the same stage of manufacturing. And so what that chart shows is the churn up in the first half of this year. So the early stage of the Broadwell ramp because of some of the old issues that we’ve talked about, it is higher. On a non-normalized basis, it’s a higher cost. But by the time we get into the back half of the year on a non-normalized basis, Broadwell actually is less expensive than those other products at the same stage of their life.
Stacy Rasgon
So you think if I integrate that curve over the lifetime, the integration unit will be lower?
Stacy Smith
Hey, Stacy. We’ll go ahead and answer that question. But I just want to remind you, we are trying to take two questions per person, please.
Stacy Rasgon
Sure. Thank you.
Brian Krzanich
So, I haven’t done a volume weighted ramping, or a volume weighted cost comparison. I’ve just looked at it in the curves that I showed you. So, I guess a lot of it depends on how much volume happens after we get to that point of parity and improvement. But I think that the cost per transistor and the fact that we are investing that in lower die sizes and more features, we think we are getting super high performance and very cost effective product on 14-nanometer.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. Thank you, guys.
Brian Krzanich
Thanks, Stacy.
Operator
The next question comes from Ruben Roy from Piper Jaffray.
Ruben Roy
Thank you. First question for Brian, just around SoFIA and some of the commentary that you had on expectations for a solid ramp in the second half, just qualified internally I believe. Is the chip qualified on network and can you talk about design win traction at this point?
Brian Krzanich
Sure. So we have -- let me start, there’s a series of SoFIA products. So as the SoFIA -- the first of the product is the SoFIA 3G, which is -- basically has a 3G modem. The second product will be a SoFIA LTE modem. What we said was that 3G modem version, the SoFIA 3G has finished its internal qualification, which means that we’ve gone through and made sure that the apps processor is fully functional and the modems working. All of that work is done and it’s electrically and logically functional.
We are in the process now of what we -- and we’ve got several design wins. And I’m just never able to go and tell you, but it’s with all of our major OEMs and partners plus some. We are in the process now going out to the carriers and getting the carrier certifications and that’s why we said it actually. That’s the difference, the time difference between ramping a product, or qualifying the product in Q4 internally and before our customers can ramp in the first half is a lot of that qualification and getting it out there into the rest of the world. Same thing will happen. We said we would qualify internally in the first half, the LTE, with a ramp of the second half. It’s that same process that’s going to occur.
Ruben Roy
Thank you for that, Brian. Just a quick follow-up for Stacy on the data center side. Solid year for ASP growth and I think over the last few years you have been averaging kind of mid-to-high single digit ASP growth. Can you talk a little bit about the drivers behind that and if you think that’s sustainable over the next couple of years? Thanks.
Stacy Smith
Yeah. So, I think I have said in the past, I view ASP growth in the data center product line as being much more akin to capacity additions. So as the performance of the machines go up, as people move up in terms of one-way servers to two-way, to four-way servers, what we see that as a increase in ASP. But it really is from the standpoint of a CIO, an increase in capacity that they go and buy.
How sustainable it will be? I don’t know. But it is a segment of the market where as we bring technology and then that technology brings benefit to the customer and increases their capacity and decreases our operating costs, we get paid for advancing technology faster than others can do it. I don’t know, Brian, if you want to add anything to that?
Brian Krzanich
I think you covered it well.
Ruben Roy
Great. Thanks, guys.

The next question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer
Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Brian, Stacy, nice job on the quarter. But my first question, Stacy is a follow-up on gross margins. You’ve given us Q1 and you’ve told us that second half is going to be above that kind of full year guide at 62%. I’m kind of curious. Relative to how you see the first half playing out, is Q1 going to be the trough, or do you have more sort of non-operational things like start-up costs in the June quarter that could actually have gross margins go down against sequentially in June before rebounding in the second half?
Stacy Smith
Yeah. I’m not sitting on a bunch of bad news for Q2. So, I would expect Q1 to be the trough for the year.
John Pitzer
And that’s helpful. And then for my follow-up Brian, one of the things that happened when PC penetration slowed was that mix actually got better than, I think a lot of us from the outside looking in thought. Do you think that now that tablet penetration growth seems to be slowing that we could see some stabilization of mix, or even some mix-up, or how do you view the tablet market as unit growth begins to slow relative to mix?
Brian Krzanich
That’s an interesting question, John. I think that almost like the PC, if you really look back at the PC, the PC began to kind of bifurcate. You did see systems coming in at lower and lower price points, right. And you saw kind of a bottom of the PC market go from the $500 range to, as we said now you can go out there and get a good system, $249 all the way down to $199 with Chrome.
I think and then you saw. But at the same time, as you said, we saw record Core i7 and the gaming PCs are hitting record levels. And so the high end kind of did very well, as above and we’ve been working on filling in that middle. I think the same thing is going to happen on tablet. You are going to see a robust low end of the tablets. I go to Shenzhen. I see what’s coming out of China right now. And there are some good low cost tablets that are going to come out and continue to drive probably that average ASP of systems down into the sub $100 range.
At the same time, I think you see systems that we’ve got them, coming with all of our major OEMs, Lenovo, Dell, HP, systems with real innovation, things like the RealSense snapshot, thinner and lighter, longer battery life, better screen, the edge-to-edge screen. People are willing. If you bring the innovation, a $399 tablet, maybe $299 to $399 tablet is not an unreasonable price if you bring the performance or capability that’s new and innovative. So, I think we will get that same kind of effect, yes, in the tablet space that we saw in the PC space as well.
John Pitzer
Okay. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.
Stacy Smith
Okay.
Brian Krzanich
Thanks, John.
Operator
The next question comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore
Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Stacy, a couple for you actually. The first one is on full year R&D spend. It looks like you are growing that in line to slightly even faster than the midpoint on the revenue side of things. Can you just give us a little bit of detail why the R&D is going to be up about 6% year-over-year, especially given that it’s either the tick or the tock year where some of the expense goes up in the COGS?
Stacy Smith
Yeah. There is a -- I’d say two things to point to you. So, first of all, we are making increases in R&D investment in areas where Brian and I have looked and believe we are going to get a significant payoff on those investments. So, specifically Data Center Group, the Internet of Things Group and a bit more towards process technology. And then we are offsetting some of that with decreases in investment in other areas that you’ve seen, the MCG segment being top of that list and some efficiencies across our Product Engineering Group.
I’d also point to you the second phenomenon, which is the acquisition of Axxia, which is going into the Data Center Group and increases our product or improves our product portfolio there in the networking space, is bringing along some R&D costs associated with that. And so that’s part of what is adding to the R&D spending next year.
Ross Seymore
Okay. And I guess as my follow-on in somewhat similar. We talked a little bit about this at CES, but Stacy, I want to get your view. Broadwell’s launching in the fourth quarter and then starting to ramp now. Skylake, it sounds like you want to continue to have that be on time and I guess the early part of the second half of this year. To the extent of the Broadwell, duration is shorter than normal. What sort of business implications, whether it’d be on the revenue, the COGS, et cetera line, should we think of to hit the financials throughout the year?
Brian Krzanich
Well, this is Brian. Let me first kind of answer how we are looking at this and we are not going to slow Skylake down. We said it will be a second half of this year. I don’t want to slow it down because it brings a lot of innovation, a lot of new capability to this market. We think we’ve managed between the SKUs of what SKUs we are bringing out on Broadwell to really refresh the 2 in 1 devices, the Chromebooks. We wanted to bring Core M out, which I think in the first part of this year with the Chinese New Year, the back-to-school season, having the super-thin and light devices is going to be critical.
So missing that by doing something else with Broadwell would have been a mistake. And I think getting that volume is a good thing. We think we’ve managed the transition on the number of SKUs as Broadwell will have and how we will transition the market to Skylake now moving forward from a margin or COGS standpoint. But remember, they are on the same technology, the same piece of silicon, it’s the same factory. All we do is change the piece of glass in the scanner to get a different product. So there is not a change or revamp of our factories that needs to occur for this.
Stacy Smith
Yeah. That last point is important. They are both 14-nanometer products for us. So it doesn’t change our factory profile. And just generally, the faster we bring out new features and cool stuff to the market, the better off we are. So we are not planning to slow down Skylake, if that was at the heart of your question.
Ross Seymore
Great. Thank you.
Operator
The next question comes from C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI.
C.J. Muse
Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, Brian, I wanted to, I guess, clarify a comment you made earlier. I think you said that you’re driving $800 million out of the business in mobility in 2015, including reorg to drive efficiencies. And I guess my question here is, does that include also the benefit of lower contra-revenues?
Brian Krzanich
Yes.
Stacy Smith
That’s an all-in number.
Brian Krzanich
Yeah, that’s. So it’s the efficiencies we will gain from the organizational structure. We are doing continued, just I will call it fundamental cost reduction, getting the right P mix in there, reducing the board count, board layers, that kind of I will call basic engineering and the introduction -- the increased percentage of Bay Trail cost reduction at the beginning and then introduction of SoFIA in the second half, which has no contra-revenues. So you put all of those together and they will add up to that $800 million.
Stacy Smith
And the ramp of LTE, that’s the...
Brian Krzanich
[Indiscernible]
Stacy Smith
Yeah.
C.J. Muse
Great. And then, I guess as my follow-up, can you provide, I guess, some additional color on the Rockchip and Spreadtrum side, would love to hear what milestones perhaps we should be watching for?
Brian Krzanich
I think let’s start with Rockchip. On Rockchip, we’ve actually been working with them on their first design. It’s an enhancement to the 3G, so it’s SoFIA 3GR, you will see it. It’s got some enhancements to the graphics and some other functionality. I think you will see that in 2015. They’ve already got their first silicon out. You have to go talk to them. Again, part of this is they have a certain level of independence. They are going to ramp and launch that product when they feel ready.
But the first silicon is out and they are going at their validation and certification. So we are right on schedule. I’d say actually, we are slightly ahead of schedule with Rockchip and we will continue to bring designs. And next, we will move to LTE just like ours and then keep moving on, just right in line with ours, just a little bit, maybe a quarter or two after our exemplary product as well.
From a Spreadtrum, that deal closed more in the second half of the year. We’ve started the work with them with the product definitions done, we are working on exactly what their SoFIA will look like and we will progress through that through this year. But the relationship and the model of having them produce SoFIA derivatives with additional features or additional capabilities targeted towards their specific market and channels is exactly the same methodology that we will take.
C.J. Muse
Very helpful. Thank you.
Mark Henninger
Thanks, C.J. And operator, we will go ahead and take two more questions, please.
Operator
The next question comes from Matt Ramsey from Canaccord Genuity.
Matt Ramsey
Thank you very much for taking my question. Brian, I wanted to ask on DCG, obviously a really big quarter in December, up about $1 billion from the March quarter. Apparently you talked a bit about it being lumpy with the cloud customers, maybe you can talk about what part of that big jump in revenue from September to December was from first time purchases of Grantley? I guess the longer-term question I’m asking is the health of the enterprise server market relative to some weaker trends we saw earlier in the year and the recovery in the back half of ‘14? Thanks
Stacy Smith
Yeah. This is Stacy. We are not going to get that granular. I don’t think that in terms of a breakout of the DCG revenue. I would say what we saw in Q4 was, we saw strength in enterprise and then we continue to see those robust growth rates in cloud and networking and data analytics. Beyond that, I’m not going to break it out.
Matt Ramsey
Fair enough. And Brian, as a follow-up in the mobile group, we see obviously great work in hitting the target on the tablet units. Maybe you could talk a little bit about the market reception and the health of the channel for those products, particularly since a lot of those are Chinese OEMs, with sort of the set-up for Chinese New Year on the tablet side? Thanks.
Brian Krzanich
Sure. I’d -- let’s see, I’d tell you that market reception in the channel so far for the Intel tablets has been very strong. There is a strong brand value just in Intel tied to a tablet, no matter who is the manufacturer. The tablets we’ve made with Lenovo and Dell and many of the -- I will call it major OEMs, have been selling very well. And you saw the great reception, the Dell Venue 8, for example, 7000 got at CES. I will call it the more broad products that are coming out of China, more of the Shenzhen marketplace.
So far, they have been selling quite well. And the number, I’d say the number of OEMs that are working with us in that space and amount of innovation and breadth that they are bringing to these products has surpassed even what our expectations were. And as we show them things like RealSense and WiDi and WiGig, all these capabilities both from the tablet and the PC space, we are seeing a lot of innovation coming out of that in Chinese market -- Chinese manufacturer space.
Matt Ramsey
Thank you very much.
Mark Henninger
Thanks, Matt. And operator, please go ahead and introduce our last questioner.
Operator
The final question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya
Thank you for taking my question. As my first one, Brain, how important is the recovery in emerging markets to maintaining your expectations for flattish PC growth? And how are you balancing the push there in terms of the low cost tablets versus PCs?
Brian Krzanich
Sure. So if you remember Vivek, what we said for the year is we’d be roughly flat in units. We also forecasted a roughly similar worldwide economic or worldwide demand scenario as what we’re seeing today. So we did not build in a big recovery or big resurgence of the emerging markets into our ‘15 model. So we are not dependent on an emerging market recovery or return in order to make our numbers for ‘15.
The next question you asked is what about tablets and the low-end tablet. And I’d really say, it’s the low-end tablet and the emergence of the phablet in that space versus the PC. And we think that if I took a look at that, the phablet is probably taking a little bit more out of the tablet than the PC. I think people still are going to use the PC for their high-end usages, when they have to have a keyboard, when they have to have the higher-end compute.
And for the low-end kind of, I want to look at the material, I want to watch a video, I want to scan my data, it’s the phablet and the tablets that are kind of battling it out for the user in that space I would say. And you see the large growth that’s occurring in phablets in the emerging markets. So bottomline, we’re not expecting our emerging market recovery. We’re not building our forecast on that. And so that’s why we’re feeling comfortable with our current PC forecast.
Vivek Arya
Got it. And just as a quick follow-up, you mentioned the ramp in discrete LTE. I know, you have done very well at Samsung, any more progress there and just the broadly customer diversification on your LTE chip for this year? Thank you.
Brian Krzanich
Yeah. We continue to win other customers. We don’t talk about customers until the products are launched. But we’re pretty comfortable with the design wins we’re getting. You see it, as you said there is some at Samsung, there is some at Lenovo. You’ll see them coming into Rockchip and Spreadtrum in the second half of the year with their products, the SoFIA products. And there are several others. We just aren’t going to talk about those until they’re ready to announce the products.
Vivek Arya
Thank you.
Mark Henninger
Thanks, Vivek. And thank you all for joining us today. Jamie, please go ahead and wrap up the call.

Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Third Quarter 2014 Intel Corporation Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, today’s conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the call over to Mark Henninger, Head of Intel Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.

Mark Henninger
Thank you, Jamie. And welcome everyone to Intel’s third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. By now, you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with it. If you’ve not received both documents, they are available on our investor website intc.com.
I’m joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO; and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we’ll hear brief remarks from both of them followed by Q&A.
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today’s discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Also, if during this call we use any non-GAAP financial measures or references, we’ll post the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliation to investor our website intc.com.
And finally, I’d like to remind everyone that we’ll be hosting our annual investor meeting here in our Santa Clara headquarters on Thursday, November 20th. If you have questions about the event or logistics, please contact Investor Relations.
So with that, let me hand it over to Brian.
Brian Krzanich
Thanks Mark. Our third quarter results were consistent with our expectations and included a number of important milestones. Revenue and earnings per share both set new records with strong performances from the PC and the Data Center groups. The trends we observed in the PC market last quarter continued the stability in mature markets offset by ongoing declines in emerging markets.
The PC Client Group launched Core M, a new family of products with full core performance in both compute and graphics in a fanless design, enabling breakthrough designs and form factors. The first of these systems will be available by the end of this month.
In the Data Center, we saw double-digit revenue growth across all four major market segments. Enterprise grew 11%; networking grew 16%; and HPC; and cloud service providers grew 22% and 34%, respectively. We also launched the new Xeon E5 processor, formerly known as Grantley. This product family provides leadership, features and performance for compute; storage and network workloads. Formally launched just five weeks ago, E5 is already 10% of our DP or two-socket volume.
In the Mobile and Communications Group, losses declined sequentially and that’s the trend we need to see continue. Tablet volume was nearly 15 million units and we remain on track to our 40 million unit goal for 2014. Third parties estimate that we are now the second largest tablet [assesses] vendor worldwide and the largest among merchant suppliers.
In addition, Samsung chose our Cat6 LTE modem with carrier aggregation known as the 7260, which recently announced Galaxy Alpha and Galaxy Note 4. The strategic importance of these capabilities continues to grow. Our LTE technology, which we originally developed for phone is becoming increasingly valuable in tablets and even PCs as wireless wide area network connectivity becomes increasingly common. We estimate for example that by 2018 the rate of baseband attached to tablets will roughly double and that PCs will rise to more than 15%.
Overall we’ve made some good progress during this quarter. Yet, we have an important work left to do. Within our factory network 14-nanometer yields improved meaningfully, but we’re behind where we expect it to be. These challenges highlight just how difficult it has become to ramp advanced process technology.
I’m most pleased that our strategy for growth is beginning to yield results across a remarkably wide range of products. We sold record volumes of PC, server, Internet of Things, phone and tablet products. The diversity and scale of our products uniquely position us across the breadth of devices that competes and connects.
Importantly, our results demonstrate that we are building on our success in the PC and Data Center segments to successfully pursue adjacent opportunities. These businesses are the source of tremendous intellectual property and that IP creates valuable and important synergies that position us to compete in an increasingly diverse computing market.
Let me share a few examples. At IDF, I showed the world’s thinnest tablet. A Dell Venue with Intel RealSense technology. It has an industry first 3D camera that enables features like after effect focusing and a host of capabilities that have the potential to change how people engage with their photography. That technology was first developed for PCs and was adapted for tablets. In this case we’re in a position to differentiate in tablets precisely because we invested in next generation technology for PCs.
Another example of IP synergy is the Atom microarchitecture. We first brought Atom to market as an extension of the PC product family. We’ve purposely evolved that IP to the point that it now spans from smartphones to tablets and mainstream PCs and from storage, networking and compute devices in the data center to the Internet of Things.
Lastly I’m excited about the moves we’re making to engage the ecosystem in new and potentially disruptive ways. We’re establishing our position and capabilities in emerging sectors like wearables before they become mainstream. The data center team is customizing our Xeon products for specific customers and workloads. Custom SKUs now number roughly 35 and over the last year volume from custom SKUs has grown at 3x the rate of our off the shelf product. And we’re also striking groundbreaking strategic agreement. Our recently announced collaborations with Rockchip and more recently, Spreadtrum will provide new sources of innovation and a new set of partners that will work with us to scale Intel architecture. Our vision is that if it’s smart and connected, it’s best with Intel. The breadth of our results this quarter, our progress against our strategic goals and the changes we’re making in our approach to end markets, leaving convinced that our strategy is working.
With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.

Stacy Smith
Thanks Brian. The third quarter was the highest revenue in the company’s history with overall results demonstrating solid financial growth as we approach the end of this year.
Focusing on our third quarter results, revenue came in at $14.6 billion, up 8% from a year ago. Both the PC Client Group and the Data Center Group achieved better growth than we expected at the beginning of the quarter. PC Client Group revenue was up 9% from a year ago. We saw PC Client Group platform unit volumes growth 15% year-over-year and inclusive of tablets, we saw almost 30% unit growth. Of note, our notebook platform units grew over 20% year-over-year as we are enabling innovative two-in-one devices and growing our market segment share with Bay Trail at lower price points.
Our Data Center Group revenue grew 16% from a year ago with platform volumes up 6% and platform average selling prices up 9%. We are seeing robust growth rates across all the segments of our Data Center business.
Operating income for the third quarter was $4.5 billion, up $1 billion and 30% from a year ago. Operating income in the PC Client Group was $4.1 billion and in the Data Center Group operating income was $1.9 billion.
The Mobile and Communications Group had $1 billion of loss which is an $81 million improvement from the second quarter. The company generated $3.3 billion of net income for the third quarter, up 12% from a year ago. And earnings per share was $0.66, up 14% from a year ago.
Our net inventory levels rose modestly quarter-over-quarter as we are efficiently managing capacity while ramping Broadwell and 14-nanometer. The worldwide PC supply chain appears to be healthy with inventory levels appropriate in anticipation of the fourth quarter retail cycle.
Moving to gross margin, third quarter gross margin of 65% was up 0.5 point from the second quarter and down 1 point from our guidance. The increase from the second quarter was primarily due to lower platform unit costs on 22-nanometer and higher platform volume, mostly offset by higher production costs on 14-nanometer products. Spending came in at $4.8 billion, $100 million lower than our outlook. The overall decrease in spending was driven by efficiencies and one-time events like capital asset sales, partially offset by higher profit dependant expenses.
The business continues to generate significant cash with over $5.7 billion of cash from operations in Q3. We purchased $2.4 billion in capital assets, a $1.1 billion in dividend and repurchased over $4 billion of stock. Total cash balance at the end of the quarter was roughly $16 billion, down approximately $1.7 billion from the prior quarter. Our net cash balance, total cash less debt, is approximately $2 billion, and inclusive of our other longer term investments, it is more than $6 billion. This is down by almost $2 billion from the second quarter.
As we look forward to the fourth quarter of 2014, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $14.7 billion, up 1% from the third quarter. This forecast is in line with the historical average seasonal increase for the fourth quarter. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range for the fourth quarter to be 64%. The one point decrease from the third quarter is driven by higher platform unit costs, higher factory start-up costs, primarily offset by lower production costs on 14-nanometer.
As we enter the fourth quarter, we are seeing our strategy play out in our financial results. In the third quarter, we grew revenue 8% and grew operating profit 30% versus last year. We also shipped over 100 million units for the first time in our history across a widening range of devices.
In the Client segment, we are seeing robust growth in the PC segment as a result of innovation and enabling lower price point.
We have grown to be the largest merchant supplier of tablet silicon and we are winning large designs at our LTE communications product. And our Internet of Things business is ramping out its products and growing. In the Data Center, we continue to innovate our products; bring increased differentiation and value to our customers. And underlying all of this is our manufacturing leadership. We have led the world to 14-nanometer and plan to do the same with 10-nanometer process technology.
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.
Mark Henninger
Alright. Moving on to Q&A, as is our normal practice, we would ask each participant to ask one question and just one follow-up if you have one. Jenny, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Hi guys. Congrats on the strong results. So, one bigger question then a smaller picture one for my second follow-up please. On the bigger picture one, your units in the PC Client Group being up 15% year-over-year, can you talk a little bit about what do you think is driving that in the PC market that I think most of the third party data provider says is flat? And do you think that delta can actually stay that large for a bit longer?
Stacy Smith
This is Stacy, I’ll take and I’ll start it and I think Brian will fill in some of the colored commentary about what we’re seeing in the end markets. So yes, we’ve seen some of the third party data. When you adjust for some of the other form factors like Core-based tablets and things I’d say our view of the end market compared to say in IDC isn’t terribly different in terms of growth rate, we would both say it’s relatively flat year-on-year in the third quarter.
In terms of our billing results, I think there is couple of things driving that. First, we saw in Q2 that we gained a relatively significant amount of share once everybody had reported. If I had to branch predict, let’s say we probably continue to gain some share in Q3, as is for usual, we’ll wait to see all the third party results come in to know for sure, but our sense is that we gain some share in the third quarter so that helps.
And then we’re also seeing our customers putting in place a normal supply line an anticipation of consumer led seasonal fourth quarter and that’s different than what we saw a year ago where people were managing inventory levels very low in anticipation of a very muted fourth quarter. So, I think the combination of those two things does our billing results ahead of the IDC, but feels like it’s pretty appropriate based on what I say.
Brian Krzanich
I think Stacy you covered it well, I think from what we’ve seen probably it covers most of the gap between the two numbers.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Great. And I guess as my follow-up well it’s not really meaningful to the revenue side it’s really is to the bottom-line and that’s for mobile and communications group. Can you talk a little bit about how we should expect that Concur revenue impact the trend overtime? And I believe in the past you said that you didn’t think you’d get to profitability next year, but any sort of clues that you can provide on how we should expect either the revenue or the profitability to trend as we get into next year? Thank you.
Brian Krzanich
Sure. I’ll start and then Stacy can kind of jump in because how you look at kind of how we’re adjusting the products in engineering is a little bit ahead of where you see the financials move. And so we’ll give you another two sides of that equation.
So from a product standpoint, you saw throughout this year we did a very good job of as we figure out how to get into this market and work with our customers and partners, how to reduce the cost just on the general bomb picking the right -- the right board layout. So reducing our product count all of those kinds of just fundamental engineering efforts is what we focused on.
As we got to the end of the year then we had brought out the Bay Trail cost reduce part which is really focused on -- the first part that was really focused on this segment of the market. We’re starting to see systems come on to the shelves as we go through the holiday season with Bay Trail CR and that part will start to have really a designed in cost reduced effort.
We said that we’d have SoFIA, the 3G version out at the end of this year. We’re on schedule. We’ve got SoFIA in the labs running; we are studying its validation effort. We said we’d have SoFIA LTE in the first half of next year. That’s on schedule. And then we announced several partnerships; two main ones, Rockchip and then more recently Spreadtrum which are focused around the SoFIA architecture bringing parts for this mobile space really designed by people who are in that ecosystem are very cost efficient and are connected into both the China market and the worldwide market. You’ll see those parts come out as we go to next year. So when we look at the end of next year, we’ll look how the model SoFIA has built to have no contra revenue.
And so when you go through the next year, again, it will be somewhat mixed dependant as our product shift the mix and seasonal Stacy will talk to you a little bit about that, that’s why it’s a bit hard to predict exactly when. But you will see us mix Bay Trail cost reduce Cherry Trail and then a lot of SoFIA coming in, in both the tablet and phone space and that really is what drives the contra kind of out of this system.
Stacy Smith
Yes. So Ross let me just -- as Brian said, the way the contra accounting works, the contra dollars that we recognize are associated with that platforms as they actually ship. And so what you’re seeing right now is the majority of our shipments, our products that are carrying a fairly high contra dollar per unit. As we ramp the Bay Trail CR and then the SoFIA products, you’ll start to see the contra dollars per unit come down.
I’m not going to provide a specific forecast at this time for 2015; I’ll stand-by in the prior statements. We plan to make a substantial improvement in the profitability of the segment next year, but don’t get too far ahead of your SKUs. We’re not at a point that we’ll be profitable next year, it is still our goal, but it will take a little time to get there.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
The next question comes from Blaine Curtis from Barclays.
Blaine Curtis - Barclays Capital
Hey thanks for taking my question and nice quarter. Stacy I just want to follow-up, you talked about the more normal kind of supply chain this year and helping Q2, Q3. You’re actually not guiding to down December, so it seems like you’re staying at that elevated rate. I mean just some thoughts on seasonality; you also have Broadwell kind of launches in a typical point of year. Is there any sort of catch up before you kind of ramp Broadwell into late first half next year?
Stacy Smith
So I want to make sure I’m answering the right question. You had one question on seasonality and I’m not sure I understood the Broadwell question. So, let me go to the seasonality and I’ll give it back over to you or if you want to clarify it now, that’s also fine.
Blaine Curtis - Barclays Capital

I just was wondering out that you are launching a platform that kind of usually you launch it for back-to-school and holiday and it’s coming -- the majority of the Broadwell clearly is coming kind of in the first half of the year. So it’s just say a typical timing, so just thinking about seasonality. And then I just wanted to kind of clarify your comments; you kind of said that supply chain was building ahead, but it doesn’t seem like it’s pulling back, particularly much in Q4 just thought there.
Stacy Smith
Yes. So just to clarify on the supply chain and seasonality for Q4, I wouldn’t term it as building ahead, what I’d say is appropriate amount of inventory in anticipation of a seasonal Q4. And if you go back here to Q3 of 2013, if you recall we are tracking about usually low inventory levels based on our customers, I think I used the word muted, having muted expectations about the fourth quarter. Today, I’d say they have kind of normal expectations about the third quarter. And so -- and our guidance for Q4 would be consistent with that. We’re guiding 1% up, if you take midpoint of our guidance that’s kind of the seasonality we’ve seen over the last several years. So it’s pretty much in line with normal seasonality.
In terms of Broadwell and the impact of 2015 seasonality, I’m not providing a forecast yet for 2015; we’ll talk more about 2015 when we get to the Investor Meeting which is just a few weeks away.
Blaine Curtis - Barclays Capital
Okay. And then just a follow-up on the gross margin given your full year guidance, you were looking at a step down in December and now it looks like the gross margin sustains quite nicely. Just what changed in that outlook and does any of those factors carry into first half of next year?
Stacy Smith
Yes, so the -- as you rightly pointed out, the gross margin forecast for the year is pretty much on; we were a little light in Q3, we look a little better in Q4 based on the algebra that I gave you on the last call. In essence, we’re seeing more of the 14-nanometer cost coming through in the third quarter versus the fourth quarter and that’s why you see that shift between quarters and the year staying on track. And again, it sounded little bit like a broken record. In terms of 2015, we’re only a few weeks away from the Investor Meeting and that’s a great forum for us to talk about longer-term trend. So, we’re going to hold off on the 2015 questions until we get to the November Investor Meeting.

The next question comes from Harlan Sur from J.P. Morgan.
Harlan Sur - J.P. Morgan
Great. Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on the solid quarterly execution. DCG was up strongly in Q2 and again here in Q3 up 16% year-over-year strong growth in all end markets. Do you expect the breadth of spend to continue across the different customer base in Q4? I know cloud tends to be a bit lumpy. And then do you expect to see continued double-digit growth in DCG in the fourth quarter?
Brian Krzanich
Sure, this is Brian. I think what we said was, we believe we can grow this business around 15% year-over-year. And you kind of framed it correctly that we do especially in the cloud space it tends to be lumpy, but if you take a look at what we’re projecting for the fourth quarter, we’re projecting right in line for that 15% for the year and it’s got the normal mix of what we see across the enterprise and the cloud and HPC and other data centers. So, we’re expecting Q4 to kind of just progress from Q3 and we’re not changing our forward-looking what we believe we can grow this business as.
Harlan Sur - J.P. Morgan
Great. And then -- thank you for that. And then I guess part of the reason for the lower gross margin profile in the fourth quarter is the ramp of 14-nanometer across multiple fabs. I think you said on the last call, it takes a couple of quarters to ramp up for full manufacturing capability after which time you would see ramp cost starting to come down. Is that how you still see it?

Stacy Smith
Yes. I think I said you see highly elevated cost for a couple of quarters then it starts coming down, but it takes a period of time for it to come down. That’s the normal trend. We’re certainly seeing those elevated costs in Q3. You can see it in the gross margin anytime. You’ll still see high sell-through costs of those products are selling through in the fourth quarter. In 2015 I’ll get a lot more specific on some of the unit cost trends next month at the investor meeting.

Harlan Sur - J.P. Morgan
Great. Thank you.

Stacy Smith
Thanks Harlan.

The next question comes from Jim Cabello from Goldman Sachs.

Jim Cabello - Goldman Sachs
Hey guys. Thanks so much. I appreciate it. You guys referenced the opportunity for consumer buying in the fourth quarter. We saw a really good demand in the third quarter from consumers driven by the new products that you and Microsoft combined introduced. There were great new products and the consumer uptick of them is very good. Do you think that impacts the fourth quarter versus third quarter buying at all?
And then I’ll kind of make my follow-up as part of this question. Do you see the iPhone 6 cannibalizing any kind of a notebook demand just given the price points are the same; obviously the functionality isn’t the same. But given that most of the top 10 selling notebooks are right around that same price point as the notebooks. Do you think there is any cannibalizing going on there as you get to the fourth quarter; is that part of the guidance? Thanks a lot.

Brian Krzanich
Let me start just on a kind of a general basis and Stacy can jump in. I’d say in general again we’re predicting, we’re forecasting a fourth quarter that’s seasonal. So what we saw in the third quarter approximately 1% growth as we go into the fourth quarter, which is pretty typical if you go back over the last three years of what we see Q3 to Q4.
So we’re seeing that same trend in consumer kind of being flat. It’s a normal years of performance whole through the fourth quarter. Your question about iPhone 6, no, we don’t really see, but typically we see a separation in that space between consumers going out and buying phones versus PCs. And as you say, there is a big difference in the functionality and usage models between those two. And I think people when they want the usage model and the functionality of the PC, they look at that cost. And as you said, it’s very similar cost. I didn’t say this is a really good value for the functionality on getting it, we typically haven’t seen a cost between those two for the demand standpoint.
Stacy Smith
Can I just comeback and always you had big question. I don’t think we saw extraordinary consumer demand in the third quarter. If you go back to the strength of end markets, I think we’re pretty aligned with the third-party, it was pretty flat. From an end market standpoint, it was pretty flat. We didn’t see anything unusual there. What we saw was some share gain, which caused us to have a nice bump in billings and we saw kind of a normal amount of inventory being put in, in the system relative to last year at the same time right before managing inventory levels low. So, I’d term it more stable PC markets and people betting on a normal consumer fourth quarter.
Jim Cabello - Goldman Sachs
Very helpful. Thank you. Congratulations.
Stacy Smith
Sure.
Brian Krzanich
Thanks Jim.

The next question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
Yes, good afternoon guys. Congratulations on the strong quarter. First question is for Stacy. Stacy when you look at the revenue in the PC Client Group, I think year-to-date you’re up about $1.1 billion and your operating profits are up I think about twice that. I’m just wondering if you can talk a little bit about what you’re doing in OpEx in that business around profitability and I guess how much more do you have left to drive profitability in the core PC Client Group?
Stacy Smith
So I’ll answer the question with regards to this year and again I’ll probably hold off on the discussion about ‘15 until we get to the investor meeting. But I think what you see going on this year is probably three things that are all contributing to the operating profit.
First, they’ve got a great product portfolio. And so when you look at where we’re seeing growth, we’re seeing nice growth in kind of the Core i5, i7 segments of the market. And then we’ve brought in some really good technology that’s got a good cost structure at the low-end of the market that gives them a nice cost structure and allows them to go after a unit growth.
So I think this really all starts with the product portfolio. Adding to that I think we have a couple of tailwinds on gross margin in 2014. Our 22-nanometer processors are just spectacular. And we’re at the low-end of the cycle in terms of how much start up cost flows through and PC Client Group picks up the majority of those.
And I also think the leadership of that team has done a nice job of prioritizing investments. So we’ve been making investments in the new areas where Brian and I thought it was pretty important. And so they’ve had a bit of a constrained budget. And I think they’ve done a nice job of bringing out technology that really helps our business while prioritizing within a pretty constrained budget. So that’s what happen in ‘14 and ‘15 discussion will be part of their investor meeting next month.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
That’s helpful Stacy. And as my follow-up for Brian, Brian you guys have been talking about a stabilizing PC market for the last couple of quarters, but over the last couple of quarters you’ve been laying a little more heavily on developed versus developing and corporate versus consumer. When you look at kind of the Q3 results and especially on the ASP line and your guidance for Q4, is this just seasonal consumer strength or do you actually think that both in the developed and developing market, you can now start talking about turning a corner relative to tablet cannibalization and perhaps PC stabilization in emerging market consumer?
Brian Krzanich
I think what we would phrase this as or what we did phrase this as is, it’s seasonal. And so we’re not saying that there is -- in fact we said that the consumer we believe is flat. There is seasonal growth as we move into the fourth quarter. We’re still seeing that mature versus emerging market trends that we talked about in the previous quarters where the mature markets are a bit stronger, the U.S. especially, Western Europe though as well and the emerging markets China, Latin America and some of the others are still soft. And so those trends are continuing. And when you look at the consumer as we go into the fourth quarter, we’ve forecasted a seasonal growth for the consumer side.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
Perfect. Thanks guys. Congratulations again.

The next question comes from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.
Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley
Great, thank you. I wonder if I could just push a little bit more on the gap between sort of 15% unit growth versus the market. I think you attributed it to three factors to share gains to the core base tablet and to the inventory environment a year ago. Which of those factors do you think is most important just because of such a wide gap between the numbers?
Stacy Smith
I actually think they’re all sizeable numbers and it’s not unusual for us to have those kinds of differences from the third parties. I think coming back to the prior question we’ve had sustained share gains I think over a period of time, so it’s probably a slightly larger number and then kind of a normal amount of inventory you put in the system, you do that math with the third element being the core base tablets which I think is going to be relatively smaller.

Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley
Okay, great. And then just so I understand the tablet differential, if it’s got anything that has a Bay Trail M or Core is considered a PC unit the way that you’re classifying, is that right?

Brian Krzanich
It’s more the Core. So products that have a core, I used the Microsoft surface as a great example, we classify that in a PC side.

Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley
Got it. 

Brian Krzanich
That’s probably the cleanest example.

Stacy Smith
And IDC would classify that in a different category. So that’s adjustment you’ll always have to make. I’d also say there is a piece. We tend to have a difference with the third parties on an ongoing basis. And I think it comes down to the breadth of tracking in the white box deep in the emerging markets, the tier 3 tier 4, very hard to get your arms around that holistically. And so we tend to see over long periods of time, we have a slightly higher billing number, the nature of the market number and thus we can tell it’s just hard to get your arms around the diversity of the market when you get into white box channel in emerging markets. So that’s always going to be a difference between them.

Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley
Okay. Thank you very much.

The next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Sanford Bernstein.

Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein
Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I am sorry to harp on it but I want to go back to this as well. So I understand you’re saying for your own business you think consumer is kind of seasonal and I guess flattish for the year in Q4 but obviously you must -- you and I guess your channel partners must be expecting a much bigger ramp of consumer in Q4 given how much inventory you must have built in the channel in Q3. So I guess how do you get comfort that that consumer sell-through is going to be there in Q4 and what’s going to be the consequence if that consumer sell-through is not there? Is the corporate uptake still there; is that going to be enough to offset or like how do we I guess judge the potential scenarios around consumer demand in Q4 and the sensitivity of your guidance around that?
Stacy Smith

Well, that’s a lot of different questions in one. Let me take a short here though. I’d say first inventory -- this is Stacy by the way and Brian will jump in. But I think the inventory levels, what we see is when you look at it in terms of weeks of inventory, it’s appropriate levels of inventory, it’s kind of right in the range of what we’d expect. So you termed it as excessive inventory; I think we’re not seeing that.
As always, if demand doesn’t materialize, then customers adjust their buying pattern and bring inventory levels down. But what we see is kind of normal levels of inventory and it’s sufficient with seasonal Q4 that’s what our customers think will happen and that’s I think what we think will happen in terms of our seasonal results. You also had a question on consumer versus enterprise and the strength of enterprise, I’ll let Brian talk about those market trends.
Brian Krzanich
Yes, in fact, I’d just take it back to the inventory comments as well. We do what I believe is a really good job of watching our whole supply chain from below us looking at things like the motherboard ordering pattern at the OEMs in Asia and what’s happening there is really the pulls from our inventory hubs and a lot of our -- more than half our product ships out hub now and we actually control the inventory on it, so the OEM pulls it at the last moment of use. So we see the actual usage rates there.
Two what’s flying out the shelves at the point of sale? So we’re watching all of those and I think we’ve demonstrated in the past back in the variety of market moves, we’ll react very quickly. So as Stacy said, current inventory is very typical for this 1% seasonal growth that we’re forecasting for the fourth quarter and I’m comfortable and I’m also even more comfortable that we’ll be watching it. And if something did happen, we can adjust in either direction.
The comment about consumer versus enterprise, as we said, we forecasted a standard seasonal consumer. So, we’re expecting not a great holiday season, not a bad holiday season, a standard holiday season for the consumer in the PC segment.
We continue to see enterprise strength that’s shifting; it was strong in desktops earlier in the year, it’s kind of moved to notebooks as we move to the second half of the year as some of the markets that shifted a little bit, but overall the enterprise all the way from large enterprise to small and medium businesses stayed fairly strong through this year, still seeing mature market versus emerging markets trend, mature being stronger than the emerging. But those trends have stayed and we’ve just forecasted a seasonal consumer. So, I’m pretty comfortable with where we’re at and I think we’ve got the right tools in place to watch this.
Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein
Got it. So my follow-up, let me ask the question a different way then. How much the weeks of inventory in the channel go up in Q3 to keep -- to bring them to levels that you would now classify as sort of healthy and appropriate for the Q4 patterns that you’re talking about?
Stacy Smith
I’m going to hold up on quantifying that Stacy, but I’d say we look at a range of inventory in terms of forward looking weeks and we’re well within the normal band with that range. So, we’re not seeing a thing that’s out of the day.
Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein
Okay. Thank you.

The next question comes from C.J. Muse from ISI Group. 
C.J. Muse - ISI Group
Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for the next question. I guess first question, curious in terms of whether your guidance changed at all in the last two to three weeks given macro concerns, decline in commodity prices, weakness Europe et cetera. Anything in terms of your guide changed with the vision, the seasonality maybe something little better would love to hear your thoughts?
Stacy Smith

No, I mean the only guide we provided is the one we provided a couple of hours ago. So, we watch the markets all the time. I think if your question is have we been kind of showing and doing something (inaudible) seeing some of the like the microchip results and things like that we did, we’re not seeing anything that’s unusual out there. So again, it’s not a surprising forecast for Q4, it’s kind of seasonally up on the back of a more or less seasonal Q3.
C.J. Muse - ISI Group
That’s helpful. And I guess as my follow-up question, to your specific comment on operating leverage, if we go back to your initial guide for the year at flat revenues and now up around 6% at the midpoint of your guide, during that same time you’ve grown your OpEx by 5% and in your prepared remarks you talked about IP synergy, curious how we should think about operating leverage going forward.
Stacy Smith
Yes. It’s a long-term, short-term phenomenon that we’ve talked about and we will absolutely go into this more in November but we’re still committed, Brian and I are still committed to bringing our spending as a percent of revenue down. We will be down a little bit, this year just by dent of the increase in revenue. On the flip side, this is very much a transitional time for us and we’ve been making some incremental investments over the course of the last year in areas where we felt like we needed to generate a long-term return. So, we’re glad we’re able to bring it down a little bit, particularly the back half of 2014 is better than the first half. We’ll continue to bring it down, thought we knew we were doing during a time where we were making some elevated investments that we felt we needed to make.

C.J. Muse - ISI Group
Very helpful. Thank you.

The next question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. 

Vivek Arya - Bank of America
Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk about the carrier certification and some of the competitive landscape you’re seeing in LTE base bands? And I guess the bigger question Brian there is that other than this rollup off the tablet, their contra revenues; are there other actions you can take to reduce losses in the mobile division?

Brian Krzanich
Sure. Let me try and answer your question. There is I believe two questions kind of built in there. The first was around where are we with certifications on our LTE, so where are we relative to our LTE roadmap?
What I would tell you is our 7260, as you heard has had several design wins. We’ve publicly said two of them with Samsung. There are others in the works that we’re working on right now. As far as certifications with the carriers, we’ve begun certifications across the world. And you will see the systems in almost every geography, as they come out. We’ve been shipping with a variety of products throughout this year in a variety of other markets especially in Asia. So, we feel fairly strong; we also see there is only -- there is only two people out shipping Cat6 LTE modems right now and we’re one of those two. So we feel good about our roadmap, roadmap moving forward, going beyond Cat6 that we feel is highly competitive and keeps us at or near the leading edge. So from a modem standpoint, we feel very strong right now.
You asked, is there other things that we can do to reduce our MCG spending, I think there is. If you take a look at what we’re driving on our phone strategy, we’re really driving a strategy that rather than pull and push on our own into the phone space, we’re really going with strong partners that are in that space already and have the linkages and the customer relationships.
And really that spectrum is the most I’d say perfect example of that where they’re strong in China, they’re strong in other parts of the world, they are great supplier to several of the OEMs. And us bringing our SoFIA platform, our base I8 along with modem technology and then over time we’ll likely come into our silicon as well. That gives us them and them a competitive advantage and a cost advantage we believe and a way to get into those markets very cost effective efficient way.
Stacy Smith
If I could add one thing, I think Brian is talking about -- the first step is great product, second step is getting the right investment level. And I think one of the things you’re seeing from and in the company is a lot of innovation in terms of how we go to market. There is a third piece here too which is I think increasingly we’re going to see that the IP that we’re creating for the mobile group is useful and in fact becomes a competitive advantage across the breadth of our product line. And Brian talked in his prepared remarks, if as we think happens over time more of the computers of the world, the notebook computers of the world are connecting via Wireless LAN and we’re one of the companies that has that IP, there is a lot of company synergy associated with us investing and leading in that technology?
Brian Krzanich
I think that’s a great point. You’re going to need those modems in IOT. We’ve said that roughly 15% of the PCs in a couple of years will need them. And then there is synergy, we’re going to find in even down in this space bring some of that innovation and IP like the RealSense cameras and all the way through the mobile space as well which will help us differentiate our products and working with our partners allow them to differentiate as well.
Mark Henninger
Operator, we’re going to take two more questions, if you can go ahead and introduce the next questioner please?
Operator
The next question comes from Doug Freedman from RBC Capital Markets.
Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets
Hi guys, thanks so much for allowing me to ask you question and congrats on the strong results as well. If I could dig in a little bit on what’s going on in your tablet goal, it does seem I heard a 15 million number for the quarter that you shipped, that would mean that you need to ship actually I believe if I have added up right about 10 million next quarter. Does that mean that the subsidies have peaked in the third quarter or do you think you are going to exceed your tablet shipment goal by an equal amount?
Brian Krzanich
So, let me answer the question on volume and I’ll let Stacy talk about the subsidies. Your numbers are very close; you rightly hit about 15 million, we think got 10 million to 12 million for Q4. We’re not going to necessarily try and blow the number out, but we’re also not going to miss it by 1 million or 2 million. So, my guess is somewhere between 40 million and 45 million is where we’ll end up. Exactly where that is we’ll make sure we’re passed the 40, but not there is no need to go well above that.
As we said that puts us the largest merchant supplier to the tablet business. And we’re really trying to move that space now as both our cost reductions but also differentiating with products like the Dell Venue which we believe is ph [unfinished]. And I have a lot of innovation with the first of the real subs; we have other products with our other OEM partners like Lenovo moving forward. I’ll let Stacy talk about what that means for our subsidies or our contra.
Stacy Smith
Yes. So the contra answer is a little bit complex, because keep in mind it has to do with both volume and the mix of what we’re shipping for the earlier answer to the question about the different platforms come with different subsidy dollars per unit. I’d expect net of all of that we’re going to see revenue results in the segment are not terribly dissimilar from what we saw in Q3 and then we’ll start to see reductions as we move into next year.
Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets
Okay, great. Thanks so much. If I could for my follow-up, just one on some start up accounting. Clearly it did impact gross margin this quarter and your guidance, is there any color that you can offer us on sort of what your outlook is sort in the way in which you think you’re going to ramp 10-nanometer? It appears as though the 14-nanometer, the magnitude of ramp with the Broadwell platform is a little less than you might have expected as we entered the year. Is that something that you think might repeat on future nodes?
Stacy Smith
Yes. And apologies. This is Stacy, broken record Smith. I’ll talk more about gross margin trends for ‘15 next month when we get to the investor meeting. But you are seeing in the fourth quarter, you’re seeing the front edge of the startup cost associated with the 10-nanometer and that’s kind of right in line with the historical timing of what you’d expect. We’ll go through more excellent where we talk about how that might look over the next couple of years but we’re seeing at least the front edge at the time I think you’d expect and that’s about a point of gross margin next quarter.
Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets
Great, thanks so much. I had to try. 
Stacy Smith
I understand.
Mark Henninger
Thanks Doug. Operator, if you could go ahead introduce our last question please.
Operator
Our final question comes from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies.
Mark Lipacis - Jefferies
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. The first question I had was on the tablet market. When you look at the units that you have shipped so far this year and as you look into what you’re expecting to ship next year, to what extent are the tablets that you’re shipping in to, are the Android versus Windows tablets? And has that played out differently than you expected that mix as Microsoft seems to have cut the price of the bundle of Windows and Office?

Brian Krzanich
The mix of Android versus Windows has pretty much played out as we forecasted. Probably 80% plus Android did with ours’ mix represents pretty much what you see in the marketplace. So if you walk into any store. So, there hasn’t been really any shift that has been through.

Mark Lipacis - Jefferies
Okay. Thank you. And then the second question if I may, there is a view out there that the PC growth that you’ve been seeing has been driven by mostly a Windows XP upgrade cycle. Could you update us on your thoughts on that topic? Do you feel better about the idea that’s not just Windows XP but rather innovation driving the demand? Thank you.

Stacy Smith
Yes. This is Stacy. There is no data that’s going to prove the point one way or the other but based on what we see in our surveys, there is a variety of things that are causing people to go and upgrade their PCs. Certainly the Windows refresh is one of them. But it’s also form factors, it’s the age of the PCs and the price points, I think all of that is playing in. And I think when we look across the breadth of our SKUs and knowing which of those are going into, there is large enterprise, small and medium consumer, we get a sense that we’re seeing growth that’s more broadly been just something where people are upgrading Windows.
I’d tell you the second part of your question in terms of where are we, we say in the back half of the year believe that the impact that we are seeing with XP is probably less than it was in the front half of the year but there is likely a pretty long tail that has some positive impact on the market for a while to come when you just look at the age of the install base and how many of those are now in support of supported operating systems.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Intel Corporation Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we’ll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, today’s conference call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mark Henninger, Head of Intel Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Mark Henninger
Thank you, Saied, and welcome everyone to Intel's second quarter 2014 earnings conference call.
By now, you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with it. If you've not received both documents, they're available on our investor website, intc.com.
I'm joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO; and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them followed by Q&A.
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussions contain forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such, does include risks and uncertainties.
Please refer to our press release for more information on the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Also, if during this call we use any non-GAAP financial measures or references, we'll post the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliation to our investor website, intc.com.
So with that, let me hand it over to Brian.
Brian M. Krzanich
Thanks, Mark. The second quarter exceeded our expectations. The improving economic environment, PC refresh, form factor innovation and the end-of-life of Windows XP combined to drive better than expected demand. In fact microprocessor volume in the second quarter was an all-time record.
From the most powerful supercomputers to the smallest energy-efficient embedded machines, the breadth and strength of our results suggest that our reach is extending. The PC Client Group’s results reflect the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year unit growth. In Q2, both the desktop platform revenue and the notebook platform revenue grew year-over-year.
The installed base of PCs that are at least four years old is now roughly 600 million units and we are seeing clear signs of a refresh in the enterprise in small and medium businesses. While there are some signs of renewed consumer interest and activity, the consumer segment remains challenging, primarily in the emerging markets.
The Bay Trail family of SoCs has been a standout that has helped us expand into [new] [ph] segments. Bay Trail’s performance allows us to deliver a much smaller and lower cost Atom based core in our Pentium and Celeron brands for the first time. Our Bay Trail SoC volume in desktops and clam shells more than doubled over the last quarter and now represents more than 60% of our Pentium and Celeron mix and nearly 20% of our notebook mix.
This is enabling our growth at lower price points and in new segments like Chrome-based systems without sacrificing margin. The data center business had a strong quarter with 19% growth year-over-year leading to all-time record revenue $3.5 billion. Following last quarter’s launch of the Ivy Bridge-based Xeon E7 processor family, we saw strong NP volume and a richer product mix and ASP mix.
Cloud, networking, high-performance computing and enterprise revenue all grew more than 15% in the second quarter. Demand and revenue growth in several segments demonstrated the growing reach of Intel technology beyond CPUs for PCs and servers. Our Internet of Things Group grew 24% year-over-year and set a revenue record, as the retail and manufacturing sectors performed especially well. NAND revenue grew 20% and McAfee revenue grew 5%.
Finally, we are squarely on track to our 40-million-unit tablet goal shipping 10 million units in the second quarter. We also achieved some important milestones during the quarter. We qualified the first Broadwell-based Core M processors and at Computex we highlighted the form factor innovation that 14-nanometer Core M product family will enable. Systems like Llama Mountain reference design, a fanless detachable two-in-one that is razor thin at 7.2 millimeters and weighs just 24 ounces.
We also announced a landmark strategic relationship with Rockchip to accelerate and expand our SoC roadmap for the value and entry tablet market segment. And our foundry business announced that Panasonic joined the growing list of companies that will use our leading-edge 14-nanometer process technology.
While I’m pleased with the second quarter results and the strength in the enterprise in small and medium businesses, we’re watching for signs of sell-through in consumer PCs in the second half of this year. Additionally, we have important work to do in the months ahead. We are working towards qualification of our 7260, our Category 6 LTE product with carrier aggregation early this quarter.
Later this quarter, we’ll launch our next generation Haswell-based Xeon E5 platform codenamed Grantley. We also expect the first 14-nanometer Broadwell Core M processor-based systems including fanless two-in-ones will be on shelves for the holiday selling season, followed by broader OEM availability in the first half of 2015.
In SoFIA, our integrated baseband and apps processor for smartphones and tablets remains on track for Q4 of this year. All of this work is critical to growing the business. Along with our earnings results, we announced a $20 billion increase to our buyback authorization and we intend to pursue a sizable repurchase of stock over the second half of the year.
Stacy will talk more, specifically about our plan, but this change to our capital structure and allocation is a direct result of our ongoing commitment to delivering shareholder value and a thoughtful stewardship of our owner’s capital.
With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.
Stacy J. Smith
Thanks, Brian. The second quarter came in above the expectations we provided in the April earnings call and consistent with the revised outlook we released on June 12. It was a good quarter representing financial growth and solid momentum as we enter the second half of the year.
Focusing on our second quarter results, revenue came in at $13.8 billion, up 8% from a year ago. Both the PC Client Group and the Data Center Group achieved better growth than we expected at the beginning of the quarter. PC Client Group revenue was up 6% from a year ago.
We saw PC Client Group platform unit volumes grow 9% year-over-year and inclusive of tablets, we saw almost 20% unit growth. PC platform average selling prices declined 4% on a year-on-year basis. Our Data Center group revenue grew 19% from the year ago with platform volumes up 9% and platform average selling prices up 11% over the same period.
Looking beyond the PC and data center businesses, the mobile and communications group is down 83% from the year ago. The underlying dynamics are consistent with what we shared at the investor meeting last November. We are ahead of our expectations in tablet volume but the billing increase is being offset with an increase in contra revenue dollars.
We are seeing a decline in our feature phone and 2G/3G multi-comm business as the industry transitioned to integrated LTE solutions. The Internet of Things Group is up 24% year-on-year. We continue to see robust growth across segments with particular strength in the retail and manufacturing segments.
Gross margin of 64.5% was up almost five points from the first quarter and one a half points above our original Q2 guidance. The five-point increase relative to the first quarter is due to lower 14-nanometer start-up costs, higher platform volumes and lower platform unit costs. Spending came in at $4.9 billion in line with our revised outlook provided on June 12.
Net income for the second quarter was $2.8 billion, up 40% from the year ago and earnings per share was $0.55, up 41% from the year ago. The business continued to generate significant cash with over $5 billion of cash from operations in Q2. We purchased $2.8 billion in capital assets, paid $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchased over $2 billion of stock.
Total cash balance at the end of the quarter was roughly $17 billion, down approximately $1.7 billion from the prior quarter. Our net cash balance, total cash less debt, is approximately $4 billion, and inclusive of our other longer term investments is closer to $7.5 billion.
Our capital allocation philosophy is to first invest in our business, then generate shareholder return through our dividend and then to return cash to shareholders via stock repurchases. Our business generates healthy free cash flow through economic cycles but as a result of this capital allocation philosophy, we have brought down our net cash balances plus longer term investments from over $23 billion in 2010 to around $7.5 billion today.
We plan to continue our journey returning cash to our shareholders by adjusting our capital structure to further bring down our net cash balances. The intention is to repurchase $4 billion of stock in the third quarter with additional buybacks in Q4. This strategy enables the sufficient liquidity for our operations and provides strategic flexibility to invest in our business while continuing to return cash to our shareholders.
As we look forward to the third quarter of 2014, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $14.4 billion, up 4% from the second quarter. This forecast is in line with the average seasonal increase for the third quarter that we are seeing over the last several years.
We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range for the third quarter to be 66%. The one and a half point increase from the second quarter is primarily driven by lower platform unit costs and higher platform volumes. This is partially offset by lower platform average selling prices.
Turning to full year 2014, we are planning for revenue growth relative to last year. This is approximately 5%. We are forecasting the midpoint of our gross margin range at 63%, up two points from the midpoint of the outlook provided on April 15. This increase is primarily driven by lower platform unit costs, higher platform volumes partially offset by lower platform average selling prices.
As I reflect on the first half of 2014, I believe the strategy that we put in place for this year are playing out nicely to extend the reach of Intel technologies across the spectrum of the smallest embedded devices to the most powerful supercomputers. We have seen better than expected trends in the overall PC market but strength in both non-consumer and desktop segments.
We’re enabling innovative two-in-one devices and lower price points and we are growing our market segment share. We have brought new products into the data center which drive a strong return on investment for our customers to upgrade their infrastructure and we are benefitting from both our product line up and the build out of the cloud.
The Internet of Things business is growing fast as we bring intelligence to more and more devices and we are making investments in communications and tablets that benefit the breadth of our businesses and set us up for improving financial results going forward. As a result of these trends and our execution, our financial results are improving. We’re generating free cash flow and we were returning more of that cash to our shareholders.
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.
Mark Henninger
Okay. Thank you, Brian and Stacy. Moving on to the Q&A, as is our normal practice, we would ask each participant to ask one question and just one follow-up if you have one. Saied, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you for taking my question. I have the first question on the PC side and the second one on smartphones. So, Brian, on the PC side, obviously a good growth in enterprise and obvious question is how long does that last? And then I think you had mentioned in your comments that the consumer has not yet recovered and the industry has tried lots of things, different form factors, price points, et cetera, but it has not seem to revive the consumer. So what will it take to revive the consumer side because that will be an important factor for next year on the PC market?
Brian M. Krzanich
Sure. So let me try and answer your questions. The first one was good growth on the enterprise side, small and medium business, how long will it last? We think it’s driven by multi-factors, it’s driven by the good form factors, the 600 million systems four years or older, new price points and Windows XP end-of-life. So all of those things are coming together to drive this. We see it at least lasting through this year we believe and that’s built into our forecast. So that’s as far as we’re looking out today. The second part of your question was what does it take to reinvigorate the consumer? We’ve got a lot of things lined up for the second half of this year to work on that; everything from marketing to really – we talked about in the call, the Core M Broadwells, those are going to allow really a whole new class of system as we go out through the holidays and into next year where they’re two-in-one devices but they now become fanless, ultrathin, very portable, long-battery life, strong Core performance or Core like performance. We believe that will bring another class of system into the market as well along with just an overall general refresh of many, many of the form factors. We think that all of those things will start to move it but that is part of why we put this caution on we’re still going to watch as the consumer trend goes through the second half of this year.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Understand. And as my follow-up, you have said previously that you plan to bring baseband production in-house to set the SMC today, but I think you have said in the past that you plan to bring it in-house sometime late next year or 2016. Is that still an important milestone? Are you on track to do that? And importantly will it require any incremental CapEx or OpEx? Thank you.
Brian M. Krzanich
Yes, it is still important to bring the baseband and it’s always important – one of the real advantages of Intel is an integrated device manufacturer, an IDM, and we believe that the integration of the process technology and the design and our leadership in Moore's Law just gives us a real advantage when you look at the whole ecosystem. So it’s always critical for all of our products to move them inside as fast as we can. And yes, we’re still targeting towards end of '15 or beginning of '16 to move those products inside.
Stacy J. Smith
And I’d just say to the last part of your second question from an OpEx standpoint it’s in our run rate. We’re investing in the modem technology today and from a CapEx standpoint it won’t meaningfully move the needle in terms of CapEx.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch

Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley
Great, thank you. It was really nice gross margin guidance and if I look back historically a couple of years ago and I think four years ago, you had some gross margin headwinds in midyear when you ramped all of the fabs in the new process at once and obviously you don’t seem to be seeing those headwinds in Q3. Am I thinking about that the right way and is there still some cost of ramping 14-nanometer that’s still ahead of us?
Stacy J. Smith
So, yes, you’re thinking about that the right way and I think if you do the algebra and you look at our actual gross margin in Q1 and Q2 and the projection for Q3, you’re going to come up with a number in Q4 that comes down a few points from what we’re forecasting for Q3. We haven’t locked in on the forecast yet but it’s down a bit and that is exactly the phenomenon of what you said. When we get to Q4, we’re ramping multiple 14-nanometer factories simultaneously. We think we’ll see a little bit of an increase in cost in Q4. And in addition in the fourth quarter, because our 14-nanometer products Broadwell is a family of products, we’ll still see some pre-PRQ quals that will cause reserves to go up a little bit in Q4 is our best prediction at this time.
Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley
Great, thank you. And then separately looking at the buyback, what’s the timeframe of the 20 billion repurchase and can you talk about what’s kind of the optimal net cash flow that you’d like to maintain on the balance sheet?
Stacy J. Smith
Yes, great question. Let me answer the second one first because I’m not actually going to give you a ton of clarity on the timeline to the 20 billion, but if you think about this as a multiyear focus that we’ve had, I think you can see this playing out. And if you go back to 2010, as I said in my prepared remarks, and you look at net cash plus some of the other investments the treasury group makes, we had a net cash balance that was running in the mid-to-high 20s back then. We brought it down to sub 10 as of Q2. I think it’s really a sign. And along the way we’ve stress-tested our business in terms of cash generation through things like the economic downturn and it’s increased our confidence that we generate free cash flow even in kind of macroeconomic situations that are a less favorable. So, we’re taking the next step there to bring cash balances down further. From my perspective as CFO if we’re targeting kind of what the definition of cash I just gave, something around 0 net cash, it still gives us a positive gross cash balance. We have plenty of cash for strategic reasons and operational reasons. That feels like a pretty comfortable number. And then to do that we’ll do 4 billion of buyback in Q3 on top of the 2 billion that we executed too in Q2. We’ll do another sizable buyback in Q4 TBD exactly the size of that, and that will get us pretty close to that goal. And then you can do the math of cash generation next year and kind of figure out how in your model we’ll go through the 20 billion, but I think we’ll go through a chunk of it just over the next six months.
Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley
Great, thank you very much.
Stacy J. Smith
You’re welcome.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
Brian and Stacy, congratulations on the strong results. Brian, I guess my first question is just whether or not you can go into a little bit more detail into DCG and with ASPs being up 11%, I know you gave us some color in your commentary but I am kind of curious to what extent was that a better mix of enterprise, was it hyper scale mixing up even more than they did in the calendar first quarter? And to the extent that you said the Grantley doesn’t come until this calendar quarter, I’m kind of curious as to how you see that ramp playing out and how accretive that might be to the data center business?
Brian M. Krzanich
Sure, I’ll start and then Stacy can add in since you’ve got a mix of the product and then how the financials roll into that as well. I think if you just take a look, what we said if you look back at the remarks, we said almost all of the segments of the enterprise were up 15%. That was a mix of volume and ASPs across the board there. You were correct to that Grantley doesn’t go until this quarter, but we did continue to launch the E7 during this quarter and see that ramp, which definitely helps our ASP and overall product mix. 
Every one of these launches is a little bit different. They always have a mix of kind of what are our customers doing? If you just take a look at the data center volume in general, it tends to be a bit lumpy. There were big orders as people fill out their data centers. Whether it’s an HPC order or a cloud order or an enterprise order, they tend to come in big pieces. And so as we move into the Grantley launch, we’ll have to see how the customers place their orders and what the volume is. So we don’t look at it on a quarterly basis when we look at something like a Grantley launch. We really look at it over a longer period of time. Over a longer period of time we think it’s going to be a very powerful product. But exactly how that transition will occur, we don’t try and look at it that closely on a quarterly basis.
Stacy J. Smith
If I may just add a couple of things, John. So in terms of the Q2 ASP uplift, as Brian said, it’s a combination of things but one thing you need to keep in mind we are shipping and selling Grantley today into cloud and HPC customers and we saw the E7 moving into production. So, we had a combination of things in the second quarter and I think where Brian was taking is we’re really happy with that 19% growth rate in the second quarter but we’re expecting a nice robust growth rate when we move into the back half but not 19%. We think there was some specific purchasing going on with some of the large cloud providers that probably don’t repeat exactly as we get into the back half.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
That’s helpful, Stacy. Then Stacy going to solving the algebra equation for Q4 gross margins, it kind of implies gross margins could be down as much as 400 basis points sequentially from doing the math right and that would be about 2x kind of the hit you saw as you were ramping the 22-nanometer node about a year ago. And I’m just kind of curious is that because you’re ramping more volume? And there’s clearly been a lot of speculation about how 14 is going and how Broadwell is going in the popular press, so I am wondering if you can comment whether or not the margin trends you’re seeing in the calendar fourth quarter are kind of as expected and generally just kind of characterize how that 14-nanometer Broadwell ramp is going from your perspective?
Stacy J. Smith
Sure and I’ll let Brian come in on the 14-nanometer but I’ll help you with the algebra. So first I think we have to be careful not to get trapped in the rounding here because if you’re at 0.2 on gross margin you get to a different answer for the Q4 number. I’d expect it to be down a bit but there’s nothing untoward there other than the fact that we’re ramping multiple factories at once and that we’ll still have some – either way Broadwell is rolling out of the family of products. We’ll some preproduction builds that will cause reserves to go up. So, I guess I’d be cautious if not. It will be down some but I wouldn’t hit any alarm bells. There is nothing beyond that that’s happening in the fourth quarter. In terms of 14-nanometer, I’ll let Brian take that more from the operational standpoint.
Brian M. Krzanich
Yes, 14-nanometer it’s going along exactly as we said in April. We said we would during this quarter qualify and we did qualify our 14-nanometer product and we actually are shipping product today to our customers and partners. We said we would have products on shelves for the holiday season and we continue to work with our partners and we’re on schedule to have product on shelf in the holiday. We talked to you about this. We focused on Core M which is the Broadwell part that we think really highlights the power of 14 nanometers and the Broadwell architecture. As I said, it will be the first class of core level PC products that are fanless. We talked to you about the Llama Mountain product 7.2 millimeters thick, 24 ounces in weight, fanless. Those are going to be devices that we think will start to transform how people think about a two-in-one device in the PC versus the tablet. That’s what we focused on. The rest of the products, as we said, it will launch and ramp as we go through 2015.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
All right, thanks guys and congratulations again.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs
Hi, guys. Congratulations. Thanks for letting me ask a question. You guys, Stacy, have been real helpful in giving us some idea on the algebra for the gross margins in the fourth quarter. If I do the same on the revenues, it looks like kind of flattish revenues which should be a little bit below seasonal. You guys have done a great job executing versus your plan in the last couple of quarters. You’re leaving some room for conservatism in there or is that more of a function of kind of the XP end-of-life which Brian referred to sort of playing itself out? Thank you.
Stacy J. Smith
Sure. I wouldn’t say conservatism. It’s exactly what Brian said which is we’ve seen some nice indications of strength and enterprise that mature and we can see those selling through. What we’re seeing from our customers is more optimism on the back half than we’ve seen in the last couple of years for the consumer segment, but we won’t see the sell through data on that for a while yet. And so what we have in for Q3 is a roughly seasonal third quarter. And I think if you look at the last few years, you’d see flattish Q4 as also being roughly seasonal. So I’d say nothing unusual there and we’re really watching carefully what happens in the consumer segment. We’ve got some great devices coming to the market and to add on Brian’s answer earlier, one of the things that’s really exciting is the price points that we’re enabling with Bay Trial in terms of touch enabled clam shells. We think that those will share and drive excitement in the market but we just have to watch it.
Brian M. Krzanich
Jim, the only thing I would add is what I said was we believe the XP end-of-life kind of replacement will at least play through the end of the year and that’s as far as we’ve looked at it. It can go beyond that. What I’m not doing is predicting on '15 yet and that was really – I want you to walk away with I think that’s the end of it versus we just haven’t really started to put our predictions and our estimates for '15 together yet.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs
That’s very, very helpful and I’ll leave it there on the questions. That’s great. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Hi, guys. One clarification I think might be helpful to people. Can you just give us a rough idea in your PC Client Group how much of that is the commercial side and how much is consumer?
Brian M. Krzanich
Of the overall – are you saying how much is of the business?
Stacy J. Smith
In terms of the TAM, so I’ll give you some high level numbers. I actually haven’t looked at it this way in a while, Ross. I’ll put a asterisk by this data, it could be off a little bit but what we’ve seen generally in the PC market is a shift. If you go back four or five years, it was kind of 60% plus business and 40% consumer and those numbers have shifted. It’s 60% plus consumer now and 40% business. In rough numbers I think that’s true for the market.
Brian M. Krzanich
That is our estimate and it’s very difficult to track this down to the percentage, especially small and medium business, they go into the same place consumers do a lot to buy a system. So tracking where did that system end up is a bit difficult, but 60-40 is probably not far off.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
I guess really what I was getting at is that representative for Intel as well or are you a little more skewed? I realize you have the dominant market share, but it’s within – good enough for government’s work to have that sort of approximation?
Stacy J. Smith
Yes, that would be indicative of our mix. I mean our mix is going to look like the market’s mix for the most part.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Got you. And then getting off that topic to one that’s a little more specific to you guys, Stacy you talked in an earlier question, I think John asked about the gross margin in the fourth quarter and how much it was implied being down. When you have those multiple fabs ramping it 14-nanometer, can you walk us through what a typical duration is of that higher cost inventory working its way through before the lower cost benefits actually start to kick in?
Stacy J. Smith
It’s probably a couple of quarters is the way I think about it. The first wafers from qualification for sale you have the phenomenon of a big factory that’s fully equipped with pretty small amounts of volume going through it. But we ramp the factories pretty fast. So within a couple of quarters we’re getting to a point until the factories are ramped and then the cost would continue to come down for another 12 months or so after that.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Great, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from David Wong from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
David Wong - Wells Fargo
Thanks very much. With the current schedule for the Broadwell ramp on 14 nanometers, what are your expectations for 10-nanometer timing? And will there be a follow-on 14-nanometer family after Broadwell or would you go straight to 10 nanometers?
Brian M. Krzanich
So let me try to answer your question. There’s a series of products that are on 14 nanometers. We always remember to do a Tick-Tock kind of products, plus we do a refresh of the Atom line typically, so we have Cherry Trail coming in at the end of this year and ramping in the first half. We have Broxton which is the follow-on Atom product as well and then the [Talk] [ph] or the real architectural shift on 14 nanometers is SkyLake which is also scheduled for '15. We have done no changes or shift to our 10-nanometer schedule but we won’t really talk about 10-nanometer schedules until next year.
David Wong - Wells Fargo
Okay, great. And could you give us any numbers on your 4G baseband, until shipments or revenue for June and the growth momentum going into September for 4G basebands?
Stacy J. Smith
Well, LTE and this is pretty consistent with what we had showed at the investor meeting, we’re just moving into qualification of LTE, as Brian said in his remarks, so a little bit later than we thought. So we kind of thought it was going to be the end of Q2. It’s now going to be early part of Q3 and then we’ll see a ramp that is offset. It’s going to be more towards the end of this year or early next year. And in the meantime the market is transitioning part away from the 2G/3G platform to LTE. So that part of the curve is consistent with what we saw and you can see it in our overall revenue results from the second quarter for the segment.
David Wong - Wells Fargo
Great, thanks.
Brian M. Krzanich

Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike McConnell from Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Mike McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities
Thank you, guys. Looking at just the traditional enterprise segment of DCG, it is encouraging to see that recovery here in Q2. Regarding sustainability with Grantley kind of coming out this fall and then Microsoft planning to end-of-life Windows Server 2003 in July, can you comment on kind of the sustainability within that bucket within DCG? Are you getting more confident that we could see multiple quarters of a recovery there please?
Brian M. Krzanich
Sure. I’ll start and Stacy can jump in. If you take a look at the data center in general and this gets back to that comment we made earlier about just the lumpiness of each one of these segments. We said that we believe we can continue to grow the data center in the low double digits out into time of which the enterprise is a portion of that. As we said, this quarter was extremely strong in the enterprise and we don’t necessarily – there was a lumpiness or kind of a pattern to the orders where customers came in and made some purchases. What we’ve built into that low double digits for the whole data center is an enterprise that’s in the mid-ish single digits growth over time. So that’s more what we’ve projected. We do believe Grantley will be a good product. The enterprise so we think is still going to grow in about that mid range.
Mike McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities
Okay. And then just for my follow-up, I wanted to ask about market share in Q2. If I look at PCG, volumes were up about 4% year-over-year; IDC just reported about a 2% decline in overall PC sales and you had some pretty optimistic commentary on volumes for Bay Trial on the desktop and the notebook side. So that growth relative to the market, that outsized growth, was that mostly market share gain or was it something else to do with maybe inventory build, et cetera?
Stacy J. Smith
I think it’s a couple of things. One is, I think it’s pretty clear to us that we are gaining some share and it’s not just from the traditional competitors. I think we’re seeing at these price points some shift back of tablet where we’re shipping a really nice two-in-one type touch enabled clam shell into these price points. So that’s a piece of it. And then I think the other piece is as you look at this in terms of year-on-year comparisons, if you recall last year what we saw is that our customers were managing inventories very, very lean. I think they had very little confidence in a back half seasonal selling season and so part of it is just the year-on-year comparison. What they’re doing now is putting in more of a normal build for a more seasonal back half. And last year that was not the case. So it’s a combination of those two things.
Mike McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities

Thank you. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Stacy Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.
Guys, thanks for taking my questions. I had a first question on the tablets and the contra revenue. Presumably you’ve got tablets ramping into Q3 and into the back half but you’re not calling out contra revenues as a margin driver for Q3. Is this a function of the tablet volume or is this a function of contra revenues rolling off? I think they were supposed to start to decline as we go through the year. Any color you could give us on that would be helpful?
Brian M. Krzanich
So let me start with just kind of an overall, Stacy, discussion on the tablets and on and I’ll let our Stacy comment on the contra versus margin discussion. We are on schedule for our 40 million. We did 10 million in Q2, so we did roughly 5 million in the first quarter, 10 million in the second quarter. So you can kind of break out how the rest of the 40 million come in Q3 and Q4 with clearly Q4 being probably the bigger of the two quarters remaining. We did say that we would continue to drive down our cost and hence the contra revenue. We’re continuing to do that. Bay Trail adds to that capability. As we exit this year we said they were on schedule with SoFIA. SoFIA is a fully integrated part really designed for this segment. That allows us to move into '15 with a much, much better cost structure and really drive down the contra revenue to near 0 on those products. So, we are on schedule as far as we had stated through the year of what we’re doing on our cost reductions and driving down the contra. I’ll let Stacy comment on how contra is reported versus the margin.
Stacy J. Smith
Yes. So you’re getting into a little bit of I think a math issue here, Stacy. Let me walk you through it. First, we saw more or less a full point of margin in Q2 associated with our ramp of tablets. If you think about the volume curve that Brian just laid out, let’s just both take a precise number 40 million just to anchor. We did 15 in the first half that we did 10 in Q2. That says we have 25 to do in Q3 and Q4. Let’s say it’s 12.5 million per quarter. It’s not really that linear but just take that for the sake of argument. The change isn’t that great. So you’re really into a kind of change in gross margin dollars. It doesn’t add up to something that’s significant or else it would have been on my gross margin recon.
Stacy Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.
Got it. You’re close to the run rate anyways. I get it.
Stacy J. Smith
Yes, exactly. So you saw the big change in Q1 to Q2 where it was kind of a full point of gross margin impact. It was a little hidden – it’s on the recon but it’s a little hidden and the fact that we were up five points quarter-on-quarter.
Stacy Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.
Got it, that’s helpful. For my follow-up question I wanted to dig into mobile a little bit. I don’t want to take away from the results of the rest of the business which arguably look quite strong, but at this point until it picks up there really isn’t much of a mobile business to speak of anymore. I was wondering if you could give us more of a feeling for how mobile presence fits into the long-term goals. Are you in this for I guess the profit pool that’s available or is this a strategic imperative for the rest of your business is to succeed here? I guess what milestone should we be looking for and how do you see the loss rate in this business trending I guess into the second half and into 2015? This is presumably some of the new products that are in 4G hopefully start to ramp.
Brian M. Krzanich
Sure. So I’ll start this and again Stacy can jump in and cut it on the profit side. To answer your question, Stacy, is a bit of yes to both. Clearly we don’t go into businesses to lose money and we believe that over time we can make this a profitable business. We have some ground to make up both in getting our LTE to Cat6 and in our products being specifically designed for this segment. We said we moved some of the early products Clover Trail and Bay Trail that were really targeted towards clam shells and almost the netbook era down into this space to get there quickly. And as we turn into SoFIA next year and you’ll see a family of products in SoFIA including some from Rockchip. You will see us really targeting this space and that’s how we become profitable in this space. But aside from that, this is we believe a strategic area for us. We’ve talked about all of our products have become more personal, more mobile, more connected and we’re seeing modems work their way into PCs, for example, especially two-in-one devices. It’s going to probably start with Chromebooks. Chromebooks are best when they are connected and so all these connected requirements are going to drive modems into there, for example. But you can go from a PC down through tablets, phones and into the Internet of Things in the industrial space where you’re looking at a pump that’s out in the middle of the desert someplace or wherever. It’s going to want a 2G or 3G connection probably to get that data back into the system. So we believe modems and connectivity in this space is critical to almost every segment of our business, but we also believe that we can be in this mobile space and make money. We just got to get our products there and get the right price structures.
Stacy J. Smith
Well said. I’ll specifically answer the second part of your question. Looking at it from the reciprocal, from the CFO seat, if we don’t have the ability to integrate in comms, I think three, four years from now we are locked out of large segments of the market. So it’s a critical capability. That said we acknowledge that’s a big loss and our goal and our plans would suggest that we’ll have a significant improvement in this segment next year. It won’t be profitable but we should be able to improve it nicely next year and stay on a trend. That’s what we’re driving the business to.
Stacy Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.
Got it. Thank you, guys.
Brian M. Krzanich
Thanks, Stacy.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Romit Shah from Nomura Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Romit Shah - Nomura Securities
Thank you. Great quarter. I was hoping for some more color on the PC Client business here in Q3 specifically how you’re projecting business versus consumer PC?
Stacy J. Smith
We don’t break out that level of detail. Did you mean Q3 or did you mean Q2?
Romit Shah - Nomura Securities
Q3.
Stacy J. Smith
Yes, we don’t break out that level of detail. We don’t even forecast this segment level much less at a consumer versus enterprise inside to segment. I guess I’d say from a market trend standpoint we would expect that the same market trends that we’ve seen which is relatively stronger, enterprise relatively stronger, mature markets are kind of the more dominant factors in the quarter. And then a consumer market that’s maybe a bit more seasonal and continue to see some weakness in emerging markets. But none of that is new news. That’s just what we’re seeing now and so we’re continuing those trends.
Romit Shah - Nomura Securities
Okay, thanks. And my follow-up is on the buyback and trying to figure out the pace of the $20 billion repurchase, Stacy, you shared with us that roughly 6 billion is in U.S. cash which is about a third of your total cash balance. If I just flow that through to cash flow, it would imply roughly 2 billion a quarter in U.S. cash flow before 1 billion in dividend and the CapEx commitments. So, I’m struggling to see how you can fund this $20 billion buyback without going into a net debt position? Appreciate your perspective on that.
Stacy J. Smith
It’s a little hard to follow that math on the fly, so I apologize, but the way I would look at it is we’ll do $4 billion in Q3. That as you mentioned comes out of U.S. cash. As we get into the back half of the year, I expect that I’m generating cash and a reasonable amount of cash is available to me in the U.S. Just simple math; net of any cash generation I’ll still have a couple of billion dollars in the U.S. I’ll generate some cash. That gives me a reasonable amount of potential to do another leg of this buyback in Q4. Did that answer your question?
Romit Shah - Nomura Securities
Yes, that’s helpful. Thank you.
Stacy J. Smith
All right.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Hans Mosesmann from Raymond James. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James
Thanks. Congratulations on the quarter. Brian, just going back to the 14-nanometer Broadwell, the availability to OEMs in the first half of 2015 seems to be about a year late. I understand that you made comments about Core M in April and that’s on track, but what’s driving the delay for the broader portfolio of Broadwell products? And the follow-up is what does that do if anything to the cadence without Tick-Tock? Thanks.
Brian M. Krzanich
Yes, I wouldn’t have said we’re a year late. I’d tell you we’re six months on. We targeted Broadwell and the Core M because we really feel like it’s a product that highlights the real power of 14 nanometers and Broadwell, right. It’s the one that’s going to really target the fanless thin and light highly mobile systems which is really going to differentiate I think in my mind 14-nanometer from prior technologies. But it will be the technology that brought the fanless PC to your laptop. Every one of these process nodes that we do takes – if you take a look at it going all the way out through the mobile products, the desktop products, the server products, the Atom products, it’s always a year and a half of product launch to be honest with you, every one of these. By the time you get to the E7 version and look we’re still launching the Haswell server products this quarter and that’s a technology that’s more than two years old. That part in the boarder availability is more skews out into next year. Six months yes, it’s not a year. And you’ll see a series a products through next year. It’s always a shift between our customers and OEM partners, availability and readiness to do a new skew and our readiness of the product, they’ll move as we move through the year next year. I think what’s key to me is that the process is healthy. We’ve got the product in a yield capability to be able to launch, we have a set of criteria that we use on every technology, so to be shipping to customers it’s met that quality requirement, those yield requirements and that’s we’re shipping to customers today and you’re going to have product on shelf.
Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James
Okay. And just a follow-up, does that delay SkyLake by six months?
Brian M. Krzanich
We’re still looking at the actual launch date. We’ve set it in 2015 so it’s a pretty broad window there. We’re trying to pin down and I think we go through the second half of this year, we’ll pin down exactly when SkyLake will come to market. Again it’s going to be – as we launch these other Broadwell products (indiscernible) consumers, everybody, when are they ready for SkyLink. That will drive it as much as anything on the process readiness and the product readiness.
Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James
Thank you.
Mark Henninger
Thanks, Hans. Operator, we’ll go ahead and take two more questions.
Operator
Our next question comes from Christopher Rolland from FBR Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Christopher Rolland - FBR Capital Markets
Hi, guys. Great quarter. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I missed a brief segment there, so forgive me if this was asked, but on PC guidance and operating profits for the PC segment, you guys previously said down, I think it was mid single digits there and Op profits were flat and I guess given the strong results here and guidance, can you update us for the year?
Stacy J. Smith
Sure. I would say that guidance is no longer valid based on what we saw in the first half. So on the PC market if you go and look at some of the third parties out there, you got a range of estimates and actually they’re fairly divergent at this point but some of the ones I was looking at earlier today kind of show a PC TAM that’s flat, maybe down a little bit once you adjust for things like Chromebooks and two-in-ones and detachables. I don’t think we’d be far off of that from the standpoint of our view of the TAM. And then we’ll see we believe some unit growth based on the things we talked about earlier, more normal inventory levels and more importantly some share gain and that will equate to some revenue growth for us. We haven’t gotten more granular than that and it probably won’t get more granular than that at this point. We’ll just watch the results play out in the back half.
Christopher Rolland - FBR Capital Markets
Okay. Last time I looked I think Gartner was down maybe 3% so that discrepancy is growing pretty dramatically there…?
Stacy J. Smith
There is one caveat and it’s gotten really confusing because we see these form factors all coming together and so you have to get really precise about what you call a PC Client. In our PCG results we would include Chromebooks, we would include two-in-ones, things like the Microsoft Surface, we would include detachable; so the definitions become pretty important here in terms of what are they telling versus what shows up in PCG.
Christopher Rolland - FBR Capital Markets
Okay, great. And then on the 4% sequential growth for next quarter, maybe you guys can give us a little color on sort of first rank perhaps those segments where you see the most strength?
Mark Henninger
Chris, we’ll go ahead and answer that one as a courteously but I just want to remind everyone we ask people to ask just one question and one follow-up. Thanks.
Stacy J. Smith
I’m sorry, could you say the question again?
Christopher Rolland - FBR Capital Markets
Yes, just some color on the 4% sequential growth for next quarter, how that sort of shakes up between the segments?
Stacy J. Smith
Yes, again, we’re not going to provide that level of granularity. I’d just step back and say it’s roughly seasonal but it’s not what we’ve seen in the last several years and it kind of feels like the right place to be after a fairly strong first half.
Christopher Rolland - FBR Capital Markets
All right, thanks, guys. Great quarter.
Brian M. Krzanich
Thanks Chris.
Mark Henninger
Operator, please go ahead and introduce our last question.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ian Ing from MKM Partners. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Ian Ing - MKM Partners
First question in foundry you’ve been highlighting this three and half year manufacturing lead. Any other improvements in your foundry offerings or collateral as you target the next node? It seems the window is closing here to go after some new 14-nanometer customers?
Brian M. Krzanich
So, I mean you saw we signed up Panasonic this quarter. We’re still in discussions with several other potential partners, so I wouldn’t necessarily agree that the window is closing in on 14 nanometers. We have already started carrying the learning that we’ve had on 14-nanometer from all segments both from our own efforts into the mobile space, our partnerships with our current foundry partners, the work we’ve done with third parties in design like synopsis and cadence. So we are carrying that off into the 10-nanometer space and we already have people that are talking to us about 10-nanometer foundry but I guess I wouldn’t have said that a 14-nanometer window is closing. I mean if you still take a look at the 14-nanometer technology relative to what anything else is available out there, we’re still the only company on the planet who is shipping a (indiscernible) transistor of any geometry and we’re currently the only people out shipping 14-nanometer products. So I think our leadership is – we’ve got some window where people could still jump in and have a leadership product.
Ian Ing - MKM Partners
Okay. Thanks, Brian. And then a housekeeping for Stacy, domestic versus overseas cash, is there a mix there and should there be a repatriation holiday? Would that free up even more cash for buybacks and dividends or are those already being invested overseas?
Stacy J. Smith
So there is a mix and we disclose it. If you look at domestic cash and this is not taking into account some of the longer term investments, it’s on the order of 6 billion out of the total. In terms of our priorities from the standpoint of tax reform, we actually like to see a more comprehensive tax reform for corporations that bring down our tax rate to make it more in line with what we see in other industrialized countries. That’s a bigger issue for us. We’re a big manufacturer, so the manufacturing credits become important. We think those help us create jobs here in the U.S. The cash piece for us is less important than it is for maybe others because remember we generate cash all over the world but we also make investments all over the world. We have factories in Ireland and Israel and China and the U.S. and so we consume cash. We don’t end up with the same kind of trapped cash problem that companies do that have minimal operations outside the U.S.
Ian Ing - MKM Partners
Thanks. I’ll take it up with the politicians then.
Brian M. Krzanich
Sounds good.
Mark Henninger
Thanks, Ian. And thanks to the rest of you as well for joining us today. Saied, please go ahead and wrap up the call.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Intel Corporation First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today’s conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Mark Henninger, Head of Intel Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Mark Henninger
Thank you. And welcome everyone to Intel's first quarter 2014 earnings conference call.
By now, you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with it. If you've not received both documents, they're available on our investor website, intc.com. I'm joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO; and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them followed by Q&A.
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such, does include risks and uncertainties.
Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Also, if during this call we use any non-GAAP financial measures or references, we'll post the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliation to our website, intc.com.
So, with that let me hand it over to Brian.
Brian M. Krzanich
Thanks Mark. 2014 is off to a solid start with our first quarter closing much as we expected. PC client platform unit volume was up year-over-year for the second consecutive quarter. Even as challenges remain in the consumer client segment, we saw continued improvement in enterprise clients, driven by increasing form factor innovation and refresh.
Mobile unit volume was up year-over-year for the first time since Q2 2012, while desktop units were flat year-over-year, with all-time record core volume and mix.
Our Data Center revenue grew 11% year-over-year and the enterprise segment was again in positive territory, up 3% over last year. While cloud, networking and storage were all up in excess of 20%.
The newly formed Internet of Things Group, which includes our embedded business, grew 32% year-over-year, with particularly strong demand in in-vehicle infotainment and retail. While the Internet of Things Group Atom volume nearly doubled over Q1 of last year.
We had all-time record NAND revenue driven by the Data Center and particularly, in cloud. And McAfee reported record Q1 bookings along with an 8% year-over-year increase in consumer bookings.
Perhaps more importantly, we made progress against our most critical strategic objective. And I'd like to take a few minutes to highlight that progress.
In PCCG, where we're working to reinvent computing with new form factor innovation, longer battery life and OS of choice, we saw 2 in 1 volume increase more than 20% sequentially in a seasonally down quarter.
We're now expecting more than 70 two-in-one designs for the back-to-school selling season and many will be offered at $699 or less. These trends, in combination with renewed interest in Windows 8 from our customers, are encouraging.
At the same time, we're ramping more than 130 Atom microarchitecture notebook and desktop designs with our Bay Trail M&D platforms, significantly increasing our presence in the value segment. And we exit the quarter with market segment share leadership on Chrome Systems and saw positive traction in small form factor and all-in one computing.
In DCG, we launched our Ivy Bridge MP server CPU family known as Xeon E7. The new E7 line, which features the largest memory footprint in the industry, saw particularly strong reception from enterprise as a result of its high speed, real-time data analytic capabilities.
We also announced an important strategic alliance with an investment in Cloudera which is designed to accelerate Hadoop innovation and penetration, particularly on IA.
We've broken out MCG results for the first time this quarter. In order to achieve long-term success in all of our market segments, from 2 in 1s all the way through to the Internet of Things, we're making the investments necessary for leadership, and you can see these investments in MCG's results.
For example, at Mobile World Congress in February, we announced multi-year, multi-device agreements with Lenovo, Asus, Dell and Foxconn to expand availability of out-of-base smartphones and tablets.
We set an aggressive goal of shipping 40 million tablet SOCs this year. And I'm happy to say we've tallied more than 90 designs on Android and Windows and shipped 5 million units in the first quarter, placing us squarely on track to that goal.
Our first LTE solution, the 7160, is now available in the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo and the Asus Fonepad 7, in addition to the previously announced Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. Our Cat 6 LTE solution, the 7260, with carrier aggregation, is on track to ship this quarter. And Samsung, Asus, Lenovo, and Dell are all committed to the platform on a combination of phone and tablets, along with module vendors like Huawei and Sierra Wireless.
We demonstrated SoFIA, our first integrated apps processor and baseband, after adding it to the roadmap late last year. We're on track to ship the 3G solution to OEMs in Q4 2014, with the LTE version following in the first half of 2015.
In the new devices and Internet of Things Group, we're working to extend Intel technology into the fast-growing world of interconnected devices. We completed the acquisition of BASIS. BASIS provides access to new world-class technology and a team of proven innovators.
We also shipped our first Quark SoCs for the Internet of Things and announced an upgrade of Edison to the Silvermont Atom architecture. Edison is on track to ship this summer.
And in the Technology and Manufacturing Group, who've worked to advance Moore's Law as foundational to our long-term success, we began production on our 14-nanometer process technology and remain on track to launch Broadwell in the second half of the year.
And the foundry team extended our collaboration with Altera to the development of multi-dye devices that take advantage of our world-class package and assembly capabilities and Altera's leading-edge programmable logic.
Taken together, these milestones give me confidence that the pace inside our company and our progress with our customers is accelerating. We've made a lot of changes. We have more work to do, but I'm confident that we will continue to transform and realize our vision that if it computes, it does it best with Intel.
With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.
Stacy J. Smith
Thanks, Brian. The first quarter came in consistent with expectations, demonstrating financial growth and a solid start to the year. For the first quarter, revenue came in at $12.8 billion, up 1% from a year ago and in line with expectations.
PC Client Group revenue was down 1% from a year ago. We saw PC Client Group platform unit volumes grow 1% year-over-year. And inclusive of tablets, we saw high single-digit unit growth. PC platform average selling prices declined 3% on a year-on-year basis.
Our Data Center Group revenue grew 11% from a year ago, with platform volumes up 3% and platform average selling prices up 8% over the same period.
Some insights into the revenue results of our new segments. The Mobile and Communications Group is down 61% from a year ago. The underlying dynamics are consistent with what we shared at the investor meeting last November.
We're seeing a decline in our feature phone and 2G/3G multi-[com] [ph] business, as we're in the midst of a transition to integrated LTE solutions. In addition, the ramp in tablet volume is being offset by an increase in contra revenue dollars.
The Internet of Things Group is up 32% year-on-year. We continue to see robust growth across segments with particular strength in point-of-sale devices in retail and automotive in-vehicle infotainment systems.
Gross margin of 60% was down two points from the fourth quarter and one point above our guidance. Spending came in at $4.9 billion, $100 million above our outlook, primarily driven by a current period charge relating to ongoing litigation.
Operating income for the first quarter was $2.5 billion; up 1% from a year ago, and earnings per share was $0.38, down 5% from a year ago.
As we look forward to the second quarter of 2014, we're forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $13 billion, up 2% from the first quarter. This forecast is in line with the average seasonal increase for the second quarter.
We're forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range for the second quarter to be 63%. The three point increase from the first quarter is primarily driven by lower factory startup costs as we ramp 14 nm.
We're also forecasting higher platform volume and lower platform write-offs on the qualification of our first 14-nanometer products. This is partially offset by the increase in tablet volume and related contra revenue dollars.
Turning to full year 2014. We're still planning for revenues to be approximately flat to 2013. We expect PC Client Group revenue to decline in the mid-single-digits and the Data Center Group revenue to grow in the low double-digits.
We're forecasting the midpoint of our gross margin range at 61%, up one point from the outlook provided in January. This increase is primarily driven by lower unit costs across both our PC and tablet products and lower non-production manufacturing costs.
We are forecasting spending for the year at $18.9 billion. This $300 million increase over the prior outlook is driven by increased R&D investments and litigation expenses. We still expect capital spending to be flat to 2013 with the midpoint at $11 billion.
The first quarter was a solid start to 2014, reinforcing our view of the underlying market trends. The PC market has stabilized and on a year-over-year basis, we saw unit growth for the second quarter in a row.
In the Data Center, we continue to see robust growth rates in the cloud segment and the enterprise segment grew in the first quarter. These trends led to Data Center growth of 11% year-over-year.
We're winning designs and ramping our tablet volume rapidly and we have design wins in LTE that will result in a second half revenue ramp.
Our Internet of Things business grew over 30% in the first quarter on a year-on-year basis. And we're driving significant innovation in this area as we invest to extend our architecture into the very low power space and acquire IP and capabilities.
At IDF Beijing two weeks ago, we showcased the broad range of products we're bringing to the marketplace. These products range from servers in the Data Center to innovative PC form factors like detachables and all-in ones, to tablets, to phones, and to wearables. This is our strategy in action. If it computes, it does it best with Intel Inside.
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.
Mark Henninger
All right. Thank you, Brian and Stacy. We're getting a little bit of feedback that some of you may be having a hard time hearing us, so I'm trying a different mic here and we'll hope that that's better.
Moving on to the Q&A, as is our normal practice, we'd ask each participant to ask one question and a follow-up if you have one. Jamie, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.
Question-and-Answer session
Operator
(Operator instructions)
The first question comes from Chris Danely from JPMorgan.
Christopher Danely - JPMorgan
Hello. Thanks guys. A question on gross margins. So, it's going up nicely in Q2, but if we look at the yearly guidance, it looks like it's dropping in the second half. Can you just talk about the reason that is happening?
Stacy J. Smith
Sure, Chris. This is Stacy, I'd be happy to. Let me -- I'll do the walk kind of from Q1 to Q2 and then I give you a sense of what I see in terms of the pluses and minuses as we move into the back half of the year.
As we go into the second quarter, so we ended Q1 at 60%, we're forecasting Q2 at 63%. The big driver there is we get about two and a half points of good news associated with the fall off of 14-nanometer startup costs, so it's pretty consistent with what we've been talking about and what you've seen from us in the past.
We'll get a little bit more good news associated with Q2 being a bit up in terms of volume, so that's about half a point and then we get half a point in Q2 associated with lower platform write-offs as we qualify those first 14-nanometer products towards the end of the quarter.
And then there's a bit of an offset, as we ramp tablets and start to see some of the associated contra revenue dollars with tablets, we saw some of that in Q1 but we'll see a bit more in Q2 and so that's about half a point offset. So that gets us to 63 for Q2.
And then yeah, the math if you triangulate a 61% for the year would say that we have a gross margin in the back half of the year that's in the low 60s. I think the plus that we see going in is we expect seasonally stronger volume in the back half so that gives us a little bit of a plus.
On the minus side it's two things. One, the tablet volume is backend loaded for us. Again as you'd expect it's primarily a consumer product, so we'll see in the back half of the year the ramp of tablets and the associated contra revenue dollars so that's a bit of an offset.
And then we'll also see costs coming down from Q1 to Q2 and Q3 and then in Q4, we'll see a lot of volume coming out of multiple factories on 14-nanometer. And so you get a bit of a mix up in cost from those early wafers coming off of 14-nanometer and again that's a phenomenon you'd see from us in the past, we’d expect that to come down pretty rapidly after that, but the first quarter tends to be pretty expensive.
Christopher Danely - JPMorgan
Got it. Thanks. And for my follow-up, maybe just give us your take on the PC space, just talk about how the market is feeling now versus your expectations three months ago? And then any impact from the expiration of Windows XP, either in your expectations for Q2 or with what happened in Q1?
Brian M. Krzanich
Sure. I can give you kind of an overall look at how we see the PC market, this is Brian. In general, if you look at Q1 and even as we head into Q2, it's playing out as we pretty much expected. We continue to see strength in the enterprise and that's pretty much across-the-board everywhere.
Consumer still remains a bit weak for us. Emerging markets starting to strengthen a little bit in the consumer, but the rest of the world still showing some weakness at the consumer level.
We think what's driving kind of the overall stabilization is a series of things that started to play out in Q4 and we see them playing out into Q1 and we think throughout this year and some of it is a mixture of things from yes -- there is Windows XP. It is a part of this equation.
I don't think it's the driver. If you look at the form factors that we're bringing out, the price points that we've been able to enter, you're seeing strong PCs down in the $200 range now. Haswell really coming to market as we enter into Q1 and Q2. You saw the 130 Atom designs that we have out there. So, it's a series of real vectors that are driving the stabilization we believe.

The next question comes from Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs
Great, guys, thanks so much. Just one point of clarification first. The segment -- the year-over-year segment numbers, is that apples-to-apples or does that include this year's reclassification, but it's versus last year's old reclassification?
Stacy J. Smith
No, no, it's apples-to-apples, Jim.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs
Apples-to-apples, okay great.
Stacy J. Smith
Everything got restated.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs
Great, terrific. Thank you. In terms of the contra revenue support going forward for the tablets, can you talk about the pushes and pulls as we maybe go into 2015 or whatever period you want to talk about going forward, about what would cause you to continue to do that versus maybe cutting that off? That will obviously be a critical part of our model as we start to look forward into next year.
Stacy J. Smith
Yeah, I'd be happy to, Jim. Let me even back up and give you -- again restate the strategy of what we're doing here. And Brian can come in over the top with some of the technology. But what we're doing is we're taking Bay Trail, which is a product really designed for the PC market, and we made the decision to take it broadly across different segments of the tablet market this year.
It brings along with it, at least over the course of 2014, a higher bill of materials. And that's independent from the SOC cost. It's the power management subsystem, it's the motherboard that it goes on, it's the memory solution, those kinds of things. And so, we're providing some contra revenue to offset that bill of material delta over the course of 2014.
Now, as we said, we're doing value engineering with our customers and our partners. And so we're bringing down that bill of material over the course of 2014 independent of any changes to our SOC.
I'll pause there and actually let Brian if he wants to come in over on the top on any of the technology.
Brian M. Krzanich
I think Stacy's absolutely got it right. We have a series of improvements. They have already started to kick-in in some cases around our power management systems, the number of layers in our motherboards, the memory system integration. All of those things we've worked on and actually have started to see the advantages already in our costs.
Stacy J. Smith
So, I think on a like dollars per unit, it comes down pretty dramatically over the course of 2014. And it should be relatively small, if at all, as we get into 2015. And it's, again, the enablement we're doing around the bill of materials.
And then we also have new products coming into the marketplace, like SoFIA, that's targeted at the low end, and then in 2015 you'll see Broxton, which is an SOC more for the mid-range to high-range of the market coming into our product portfolio.
So, the combination of all of that gives us a better cost structure with our own products and a better cost structure overall with the bill of materials as we enter 2015 and then work through 2015.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs
Terrific. Thanks so much. Good luck.

Hi, thank you. I had a question on DCG, Stacy, just to make sure it's apples-to-apples. The guidance that you provided for this year as well as for the long term CAGR, does that change now that you have a common infrastructure part also within that group?
Stacy J. Smith
Yeah. So, interesting what we're doing here Ambrish is we're actually now restating the segment to match how we've been talking about this segment. If you go back to the investor meeting presentations over the last couple of years, we've included the communications infrastructure piece of that because we do view it as part of the server market.
So, you need to go back to Kirk's original presentation, I think it was two years ago, 2011, and you'll see it's clearly laid out in that long-term CAGR. Brian and Renée have now organized the company more in line with that, so we have all of that under one group. So, we've redone our segments as a result.
I'll also say for Q1, because I don't think you can see this anywhere else, but the DCG year-on-year growth rate was 11% in the restated segments. If you took out the CID piece, so if we had not made that change, it still would have been 10% plus. So, it's worth about one point of growth in Q1. So, I think we're pleased with the growth rate with and without, I guess is how I'd say it.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets
Okay, that is helpful. Because you're right, at the last analyst day, also, you did have that piece in there when it was not part of DCG. My follow-up then is a quicker one. On the MCG side, are we looking at this revenue run rate bottoming out here, because now you're going into the back half, you also talk about Cat 6 shipments?
I think, Brian, you were at IDF or somewhere in Shanghai or in China. So, is this the bottom for this segment in the quarter? Thank you.
Stacy J. Smith
I think you'll see two phenomena as we move into the back half. As we said, we're seeing on the com side that transition from 2G/3G. So, we're seeing a trough-ing of that business. And as we move into the back half we'll see the LTE, particularly the 7260, coming to market. So, we'll start to see, I think, a nice ramp in revenue on that segment.
We'll have significant unit growth in tablets. But remember that contra revenue isn't just a gross margin impact; it's actually a subtraction from revenue. And so that will mute the revenue growth for the segment because you have that negative as we get into the back half and ship more tablets. To the prior question, I expect that to abate as we get into 2015, but you'll definitely see that in the back half of 2014.

The next question comes from Christopher Rolland from FBR.
Christopher Rolland - FBR Capital Markets
Hey, guys, thanks for faking the question. So, I think a lot of us were surprised to see Q1 notebook platforms up year-over-year, as you guys alluded to. Why is third-party data off year, perhaps even ODM data, off so much? I imagine some of that's market share, but what might be the rest there?
Stacy J. Smith
Let me give you the one key finance and then I'll turn it over to Brian to talk about our notebook strategy and kind of how that's playing out across the products. From a year-on-year comparison, from our billings standpoint, you have to remember that Q1 of 2013, there was a big contraction in the worldwide supply chain terms of inventory levels and I think that impacted our billings. So, we're, I think, getting the advantage of a good year-on-year comparison point there.
We still expect for the year that units are down in the low single-digits. And by the way we would love to be wrong on that but that's our view of the market. And I think that's pretty aligned with the third parties.
Brian M. Krzanich
Yeah, I would agree with that. And that's not to say that inventories have grown. Actually inventories are in very good shape as we look across the entire supply chain, both within Intel and outside. So, we think inventories, after that correction in the beginning of 2013, are actually normalized now where they will probably stay.
And as Stacy said -- and as we said in the call, you're seeing us in all price points in this space. So, you're seeing Bay Trail and even core products down at lower price points. You'll also see us gaining market share in Chrome over this time period.
We're in a significant percentage of the Chrome systems out there. So, there's a variety of things that are allowing us to get some upswing a bit in the mobile market, as well.
Christopher Rolland - FBR Capital Markets
Great. Thank you. As a follow-up, at one point there was Bay Trail T, M, and D for tablet, mobile and desktop. Is the M and D still accounted for in PC, and T in tablet? And with that 8% ASP decline that you guys had in mobile, was that natural or is that a mixing of Bay Trail M? Thanks.
Stacy J. Smith
Yes, great question. The first answer is yes, the M and D would be included in PCCG's results. The T is included in MCG's results and would be in the tablet volume that we're talking about.
And, yes, the notebook ASP that you saw was exactly consistent with our strategy. We're bringing Bay Trail in there. It's got the right cost structure. It's actually the volume is a little ahead of what we thought in Q1. It's enabling us to grow units a bit and maintain and grow profitability and the overall company's gross margin looked pretty good, too.

The next question comes from Doug Freedman from RBC.
Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets
Thanks for taking my question, guys. And a few of the things that you've guided to we've really never seen in the history of Intel and that being OpEx dropping rather materially in the back half of the year. Can you give us a little bit of color on what you're doing to make that happen?
Stacy J. Smith
Yeah. I mean as we said at quarter a go, we're bringing employment down over the course of the year. In particular, we're driving for some efficiencies in the engineering organization. But they're happening a little later than we thought. But we're -- what Brian and Renée are driving for is to get more output and more products and more derivatives for the engineering teams and that will result in some efficiency as we get into the back half.
Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets
And for my follow-up, also another spending question, that being on the CapEx. I believe there was a change to the longer-term roadmap on your move to get to 450 and yet we're not seeing really any change on your CapEx spending. Is there a change that we should be thinking is possible in the future? How would you talk about your CapEx? In the past you talked about maintenance and then the other if you could give us an update on that.
Brian M. Krzanich
The 450, let's start with that. We haven't changed. We've said that actually our 450 is similar in the latter half of this decade, right? So, we're still saying that. You're going to see gives and takes on 450 spending.
These are long, drawn-out programs over multiple years. And so I think don't grade the whole program by one shift in when we buy a tool or when we move out some spending, in some cases.
And don't forget, any time we do that you typically have just more 300-millimeter that you're going to go spend money on. We continue to hold our forecast flat for CapEx. We are comfortable with the CapEx where we're at to maintain our business based on the demand we're seeing for our core products.
Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets

The next question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
Yeah, good afternoon, guys, congratulations. Stacy, a question on gross margins. Has the full year expected impact for tablets changed at all? And if memory serves me correct, that was 150 basis points. And if I do the math right, would that alone account for about two and a half percentage points of decline in Q3, Q4? Am I doing that correctly?
Stacy J. Smith
The answer to your first question is that our expectations haven't changed. There may be -- the second decimal may have changed, but directionally it's the same. And as Brian said in his prepared remarks, we're actually feeling pretty good about the line of sight we have across the customers, the longer term agreements we have in place and design wins that we know are coming to market, as well as the Q1 volume.
In terms of the impact in the second half, I haven't done the math that way, but just to manage your math, you're probably not too far off because it's 150 basis points more or less for the year, and it's backend loaded, so it's going to be in that kind of a range.
I did do the math for the back half saying that -- that as well as the Q4 cost of 14-nanometer out of multiple factories, is the thing that keeps us in the low 60s as opposed to higher. So, I think your math probably is pretty close.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
Perfect. Thanks, guys. And as my follow on, Brian, you talk a little bit about the expectations around the Grantley product launch? Nehalem clearly drove good growth in DCG. Romley was a little more mixed. What's the expectation for Grantley? And is there a concern of a pause of buying in DCG ahead of the launch and how do you manage that?
Brian M. Krzanich
We look at the Grantley as a great product. I don't think there will be a pause. We've factored that into all of our forecasts, the launch dates. Those haven't moved. I don't see it as being a shift. Customers typically line up their products around our product launches, and they have several months to work around those and forecast there's, as well. So, I don't see a stall in our business based on what we see with the forecasts right now.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
Perfect. Thanks, guys.

The next question comes from C.J. Muse from ISI Group.
C.J. Muse - ISI Group
Yeah. Good evening. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, since you announced a vision for being a larger foundry at your Analyst Day, I'm curious what you've learned in your discussion with potential clients in terms of what may be bigger opportunities than what you initially thought and perhaps what could be bigger challenges?
And I guess as part of that, as you think about offering those foundry services to potential customers, how do you think about maybe some of the changes you need to do in terms of tool sets with Fab 42?
Brian M. Krzanich
So, let's answer the first part first. I'd say the interest since we opened up the foundry has been high. These interactions, just getting people comfortable with what the technology is, take several months typically.
There's deep interaction between the technical teams on both sides, really understanding what the process of silicon technology incorporates, what the design tools are, what IP we have to offer, where they can go get third-party IP, all of those kinds of interactions. Those have been ongoing with many customers. And then, you start the business discussions around pricing and availability and all of that.
So, I'd tell you that the uptake has been strong. We've been in many interactions. As far as what does it tell us about what needs to change within Intel, I think we still have a lot to learn about how to be a good foundry.
Altera, who is really our lead premier customer -- I'd say big customer has really been helpful. They've helped us see where we're strong and where we are not and what it takes to become strong in those areas. They are making good progress on their products.
I don't think there's a lot of change from a technology standpoint that's outside the changes we're going to make, say, at 10-nanometers of our own product. We're driving to lower power, more mobility, able to integrate better, all of those things into our own products. Integration of memory capabilities, that's driven by our own need to move into those mobile spaces. And that's helping us with the same roadmaps that are being required by the foundry partners.
Fab 42 is purely a capacity-driven based on demand. We'll trigger that as we trigger demand both either internally or from the foundry. Remember though the foundry partners signed up today.
It's probably two years -- 18 to 24 months before first silicon and probably 30 to 36 months before they really have ramped to any volume. And Fab 42 is probably 12 to 18 months from when you would be able to bring it into capacity. So, the two have a great deal of overlap.
Stacy J. Smith
And I would just add, just reading into your question -- maybe I'm reading too much, C.J., if you're viewing the foundry business as we would have a specific foundry factory, that's probably not the case. These will be run side by side with our own products and taking advantage of the same technology and technology features that we need for our product line.
Brian M. Krzanich
That's correct.
C.J. Muse - ISI Group
Got it. Very helpful. If I could sneak in a second one here. In terms of integrated LTE, you've talked about when we'll first see that. But curious when you expect to bring that in house at Intel.
Brian M. Krzanich
We'll bring that in on our 14-nanometer process either late 2015 or early 2016. We're still battling back and forth on how fast we can bring it in and at what impacts that has. 14-nanometer is the technology there.
C.J. Muse - ISI Group
Great. Thank you.

The next question comes from Blaine Curtis from Barclays.
Blaine Curtis - Barclays Capital
Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe actually follows up on CJ's prior question. The MPG business that you're now breaking out, it's pretty clear it's losing $3 billion, $3.5 billion. How do you think about this business?
Obviously you're trying to ramp the product set you are a bit behind. You're entering from the low end and that pricing seems quite tough. You're facing some subsidies that you have to do on the tablet side.
Are there some milestones that you look at to get this business back profitable? Or maybe would you consider this strategic enough that you would consider continuing to run this as a loss?
Brian M. Krzanich
So, you asked several questions in there, so let me start to pars it apart. Absolutely this is a strategic business, so let's just start with that. We think this is critical and we said this in our prepared statements. It's critical from 2 in 1 devices down through the Internet of Things.
You look across the connectivity requirements there; more and more of the devices are requiring integrated connectivity, whether it be LTE, 3G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and all of these connectivities are becoming more and more required.
We don't go into these businesses thinking that we're going to lose money. We believe we have a roadmap to get to profitability in that business. The milestones that I look at -- and so I'll give you those for yourself to look at, we have the 7160, the current LTE version out there. We're the second in LTE. We have the 7260 launch this quarter. I think that's a critical there.
Again, we're closing the gap with our competition. We're bringing out leading edge Cat 6 capability with carrier aggregation. That's a critical milestone. That puts -- that closes the gap and puts us firmly in the LTE capability.
The next one is SoFIA. If you look at the SoFIAs at the end of this year with 3G integration and then a big first half of next year with LTE integration. Remember those products weren't even on our roadmap six or seven months ago. So, that shows that we're acting quickly integrating and bringing those products to production.
Then after that is, as Stacy said earlier, Broxton, which is our internal 14-nanometer product. That's targeted towards the mid to high level. And as we bring that into the second half of 2015 and into 2016, there will be various levels of integration on that.
So, when I look across this, those are the milestones I look at, because those are what drive that along with just the basic cost reduction capabilities we talked about for this year as we get out of this contra revenue into 2015. Those products then place us firmly in leadership capability from the low end to the high end with integration. And those are the milestones to me that will lead to profitability long-term.
Stacy J. Smith
And I'll just add to that, I think you left it off because it was so obvious, but the 40 million tablets is one of the things I see Brian just laser focused on. And as we've talked about before, it gets us into the 15% to 20% range of the total tablet market.
It gives us a big enough footprint that we start to see people developing on our architectures. It becomes a self-sustaining ecosystem as we're bringing these other products to the marketplace. So, don't lose sight of that one, Blaine.
Brian M. Krzanich
Yeah.
Blaine Curtis - Barclays Capital
Thanks. And then just as a second question, in terms of Broadwell timing you had the one quarter slip. It seems like no change so far. Are there any more hurdles in terms of yields or anything before this product is ready to ship in the back half?
Brian M. Krzanich
Well, as we said, we qualified for startup production this month. We will qualify for shipment to customers towards the end of this quarter. Those are the first two milestones, so we've passed one of them. And then you'll start to see our customers bring products to market as we progress into the second half of this year.
These things are hard. There are always yield improvement efforts that we have and cost deductions that we're going through. But I think we're past the first of the two big milestones by turning on the production internal. And we have the next big one at the end of this quarter with certifying to ship to customers. We don't see any roadblocks, don't see any issues. But that's still out there at the end of this quarter.
Blaine Curtis - Barclays Capital
Great. Thanks.

The next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Sanford Bernstein.
Stacy Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. For my first one, I wanted to dig a little bit into the mobile and wireless group. So, you've talked a bit about having I guess developing leadership products, leadership position in order to drive profitability. We're looking at this right now, though. So, we had the business fall more than 50% sequentially.
You have your 7160 which is shipping but apparently it's not really driving much volume. We have the 7260 which is forthcoming, but we really haven't heard much about design wins. And you launched at Mobile World Congress without really saying very much there.
We have SoFIA coming, which absolutely is integrated, but it's being made at TSMC for the next few years which means you lose any potential benefits from your own process technology. And you would seem to be well behind what the market leaders are shipping in terms of 4G.
Just what should we be looking for and over what timeframe should we be looking for, for the ramp? I guess what I'm asking is, how can we get confidence that we're going to actually see the revenue ramp that is built into the short-term expectations for this year and then going forward, to make sure that you can actually get a profitable business, which obviously would be driving quite a bit of upside to where the models are today?
Brian M. Krzanich
Sure, Stacy. I'll start and then Stacy can jump in. Remember, the 7160, we gave you a series of products that it's shipping in. And on the 7260, which will qualify this quarter, we gave you a list of OEM partners that have committed to that platform. So, we're fairly confident that the ramp in the second half of this year will continue on that product. And it is a leadership product.
SoFIA, you're right, is built at TSMC. We went for speed and integration. And it was simply quicker to get to market with a competitive product from both a price and performance. We actually believe that the IA core will give us better performance than the competition. And the competition is at that same node at TSMC. And it's 3G at the end of this year and LTE in the first half of next year.
We then told you that in the second half of next year -- and again, we're debating whether it's the second half or the first quarter of 2016, but we'll move all of that internal on to 14-nanometers. And it's really based on other products that we have moving in at that time and just overall resources all right.
We had a lot going on -- the ramp of Broadwell, the ramp of Skylake in the second half of next year, plus bringing these products inside. But I'm very confident that when you do that, plus you add in Broxton, which is targeted towards the mid to high range and again is integrated with leading-edge LTE.
And don't forget we have a roadmap of LTE products beyond the 7260 that continue the level of carrier aggregation and product leadership. We're fairly confident that we can continue to grow this business and turn it profitable over that time.
Stacy J. Smith
And let me just comment on the question about the long-term profitability. It sounds basic, but it really stems from our manufacturing leadership. If we're two years ahead of the rest of the industry, and extending it gives us the ability that, as we target our products into the right space from a power standpoint, we will have power advantage or performance advantage and a cost advantage.
That really is our strategy playing out. You're seeing the first products hitting that theme over the course of this year and into early next year. Bay Trail is a really good product. For the high end of the market, you'll see products coming into the market that are more targeted at the mid-range and lower end of the market next year. But that's how the strategy plays out.
I'd say for 2015, I would expect to see reduction in the loss. Not profitability, but a reduction in the loss will feel pretty good when we get there and then we'll keep driving towards the long-term profitability goal.
Stacy Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co
Got it.
Brian M. Krzanich
Did you have a follow-up Stacy?
Stacy Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co
I did. I'd like to drill in a bit more. I'm actually into the tablet efforts now. So, we're obviously subsidizing. And I get the idea of reducing BOM cost in order to make up for the deficiencies with the idea being that you can drive improved product set down the road.
But at the same time, if you look at the tablet market, where it is today, you're obviously not going to be going after Apple any time soon. Maybe there's a little bit of volume at Samsung. But I mean if you take those guys out, 75% of what's left is systems that are $250 and below, where your competitors are shipping quad-core chips for much less than $10.
I'm curious to know what kind of economics and pricing you see from that market long-term. And are the -- I guess the total revenue pool and profit pool that's available, even if you were to succeed at your goals, why does that make it a worthwhile effort to actually go after? Or is this simply, as you said, strategic? Is this an attempt to limit further penetration of tablets into the core market?
Brian M. Krzanich
So, I'll start and Stacy is welcome to jump in. You've asked a question that has multiple questions built into it. But let's start with what we told you was we've got multiple OEM partners building tablets and phones on our products. And we gave you Asus and Dell and Lenovo and Samsung on those products.
If you look at the tablet business overall, it's broken up into a series of segments. And you're right; there is a large percentage of them that are $250 and below. Products like SoFIA are specifically designed for that segment.
And our dual-core SoFIA already performs quite well against quad-core systems. As we move into next year, we'll bring quad-core SoFIA-based products out, as well. And so we believe that we can stay very cost competitive and have a performance leadership.
Remember, Intel has two assets. We have our silicon technology, but we also have our architecture. And one of the things an OEM gets when they build with Intel technology is that they can go into any OS and they can build a single platform and move that on to Chrome, on to Android, on to Windows. And that's a very unique capability that we provide to OEMs for flexibility.
So, we believe with a product like SoFIA, as we bring that into the market next year, we can absolutely compete in those spaces and make money. You're probably not going to make as much revenue dollars and as much margin dollars as the PC business, but we think this is still critical. And it's critical for a variety of reasons. Part of it is simply the scale. You want to have those units. You want to have a presence in all areas of computing.
And the second one is developer attention. You want developers creating new products, doing innovation on your architecture. This is a space that's got innovation. We are going to bring some of that innovation to this market. You're going to see some tablets as you go into the end of this year.
We showed them at CES, some of the highlights where you have 3D cameras, you have perceptual computing capabilities for gaming. All of those kinds of things can change the tablet market, along with the PC market.
So, we believe that we can bring a lot of the innovation that we do in the PC down into the tablet space. And again, that keeps the developers developing and interested in our platform. I think for all of those reasons, we want to be in this space and we will be in this space from now on.
Stacy J. Smith
I would just add. That was very complete, but we don't fear the low end of the market. You look at how we played out in PCs. You can drive a lot of unit growth by participating in PCs now that are $199 to $250. We can have the cost structure because of our manufacturing lead to participate nicely there. And you see that as markets mature, they also segment.
And so we have look, you look at our PC business, we have great demand and profitability in core I7s and it spans down to Bay Trail at the Atom segment of the market. So, it's a misconception to think that we only want to play at the high end. Our manufacturing leadership can give us the cost structure to play profitably at the low end, as well.
Stacy Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co
Thank you, guys.
Brian M. Krzanich
Thanks Stacy. And operator we'll go ahead and take two more questions.
Operator
The next question comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Back on to the PC Client Group for a second and on to the ASP side of the equation, between the desktop and notebook obviously there's very different dynamics.
Do you see a point in which the notebook side starts flattening out and starts to act like the desktop side, where ASPs have been up strongly both last year and year-over-year in the first quarter? Or is that pressure to the low end going to persist and so we shouldn't think of a flattening out any time soon?
Stacy J. Smith
I actually think more about the two markets together. I think you have this range of devices that are computers and they range from a high end all-in-one down to a $199 very low cost notebook computer that's being sold. And I think what we're seeing is strength at both ends of the market.
If you look at our pricing over the last three years, it's been pretty dead flat on average across the PC market. You can see from my gross margin forecast from 2014, I'm not expecting ASP to be one of the big drivers. So, you can take from that that we continue to see a pretty benign pricing environment. So, that's how I think about it, I don't know, Brian, if you have--
Brian M. Krzanich
No, I would agree. I don't see it behaving any differently moving forward.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
And as my follow-up, switching over to the OpEx side, it's good to see the headcount coming down in the second half, down versus the first half. But you're still significantly elevated versus your target model.
I know you're not going to guide for 2015 with any specifics whatsoever. But can you remind us, if you do end this year with lower headcount than you ended the prior year, so you're going into the year down year-over-year is the tick-tock of process engineering moving from R&D into COGS a headwind or a tailwind in 2015? Are there any big moving parts that we can think about for that year's OpEx versus this year's?
Stacy J. Smith
Yeah, it's the reciprocal to what happens to gross margins. So, in a year like this year where you see startup costs coming down, that means that the engineers that were working on 14-nanometer that were being classified as cost of sales, now move to 10-nanometer and they are being classified as R&D. So, next year you should see gross margin -- some headwind in terms of gross margin and some tailwind in terms of the R&D spending.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Thank you.
Brian M. Krzanich
Thanks Ross. And operator can you go ahead and introduce our last question?
Operator
The final question comes from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies.
Mark Lipacis - Jefferies
Thanks for taking my question. First one, Brian, when you talk about the 40 million unit bogey on tablets this year, could you go through the taxonomy of that a little bit? To what extent do you think this is Windows versus Android? And what's the class of product you think will represent the mode or the mean? Like where do you think your sweet spot is going to be this year on tablets?
Brian M. Krzanich
Sure. Our mix of OSs reflects pretty much what you see in the marketplace. So, I think, depending on how you look at it, it's probably something on the order of 90% Android, 80% Android, 10% to 20% Windows.
Our percentages look very much like the marketplace. So, if Windows continues to grow and gain traction I think our percentage would just align directly to that. So, you can -- don't separate what we ship from what's basically in the marketplace. We're leadership capability on all of the OSs now.
As far as what is the price point, again, it reflects fairly close to what the marketplace is. You see us in systems below $100 now. The majority of the systems are say $125 to $250, somewhere in there. And then you see us in some of the upper end systems, $250 to $400. And so -- but the majority is in that -- I'd call it, $125 to probably $250 range.
Mark Lipacis - Jefferies
Okay. Thank you. And then as a follow-up, did you discuss, do you expect to have the Android tablets ramping in volume this quarter? Are we going to be -- should we expect to see the Bay Trail Android products at Computex this year? When do we really see the material ramp in the Android products? Thank you.
Brian M. Krzanich
Sure, absolutely. You can go out to the store today and buy an Android -- in fact, I'd love you to go buy one of the 40 million we'll sell. But, yes, you can buy Android. It continues to ramp through this quarter. At Computex, we'll show a series of Android and Windows-based tablets. And they just continue to ramp through this year. But they're on shelves today. I saw them in the store this weekend.
Stacy J. Smith
The majority of the 5 million units, for example, are Android. Just as Brian said, it more or less follows the distribution between Windows and Android.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Intel Corporation Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today’s conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Mark Henninger, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Mark Henninger
Thank you, Jamie and welcome everyone to Intel’s fourth quarter 2013 conference call. By now you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with that. If you have not received both documents, they are currently available currently on our Investor website, intc.com. I am joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we will hear brief remarks from both of them followed by Q&A.
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today’s discussions contain forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such, it does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Also if during this call, we use any non-GAAP financial measures or references, we will post the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliation to our website, intc.com.
So with that, let me hand it over to Brian.
Brian Krzanich
Thanks Mark. Q4 was a solid finish to a year of transition both for the computing market and for Intel. We spent the year of building a foundation in important growing segments of computing and as a result we are better positioned to enter 2014. Importantly, the big way of innovation inside the company has also improved.
I will touch on each of these things, but I would like to start with our results. The company’s revenue was down 1% for the year driven by a declining PC payout. The PC Client Group was down 4% for the year, but the business began and stabilized and actually grew a bit in the fourth quarter achieving all-time records of i5 and i7 unit shipments. The desktop business was particularly strong in Q4 growing 11% over last year. In the data center, we finished the year up 7% with record solar unit and revenue. Cloud was up 35%. Storage was up 24%. And high performance computing was up 18%. Enterprise, however, fell short of our expectations for the fourth quarter and the year as we overestimated the rate of recovery among corporate buyers. In our other businesses the intelligent systems business we saw a growth of 21% in retail up 16% and transportation up 21% in the year. Networking grew 31% for the year and rounding out the list, our NAND and (indiscernible) businesses grew 15% and 4% respectively both achieving record revenue.
When I spoke with you in November I shared my vision. If a device computes it does it with Intel from the internet of things to the data center. I outlined the areas that are changing to make that vision a reality. Among the changes was a shift towards a more outside in view of our industry and an intense focus on bringing innovation to market quickly. Last week at CES there was evidence of our progress as we demonstrated technologies that were on our road map just six months ago. Technologies that we expect will be available this year. We showed you Edison, an Intel based platform for internet of things in the form of an SD card. We unveiled several innovative wearable solution and we announced Intel device for technology to hardened IA based Android (indiscernible).
Our disclosure in November of a new smartphone and tablet road map that will include SoFIA our first IA SSD with integrated comps later this year is further evident that we’re innovating and bringing products to market at faster pace. Looking ahead 2014 will be an exciting year as we build further on this new foundation. We have established a goal to grow our tablet volumes to more than 40 million units. Within an emphasis on the value segment. As we’re finishing 2013 with more than 10 million units and a strong book of design wins we’re off to a good start.
We also exit the year having made important strides on our 14-nanometer process technology. Yields improved significant in Q4 putting it squarely on track with the Broadwell production later this quarter. Our customers and partners also continue to evolve the computing exercise. By the time we enter the back to school selling season we have nearly 70 unique 2-in-1 designs with outstanding battery life and performance across a range of price points in those markets. And later this quarter we will launch Ivy Bridge-EX which will bring the largest generation to generation improvement in MT Server performance in 2010. Our work to improve our velocity and position the company for the future is containing isn't done. But our recent progress is testament to what’s possible when we focus and bring all of those aspects to bear. We are building on a foundation upon which we will compute the years to come and we’re beginning this year in a better position than we have been last year.
With that let me turn the call over to Stacy Smith.
Stacy Smith
Thanks Brian. The fourth quarter came in consistent with expectations with the returns of financial growth and was a solid ending to a challenging year. For the fourth quarter revenue came in at $13.8 billion up 3% from a year ago. PC Client Group revenue was flat from year ago. Our data center group grew 8% from the year ago and relative to our expectations at the beginning of the quarter we saw higher PC Client Group revenue partially offset by lower growth than our data center group. Gross margin of 62% was flat till third quarter and one point above our guidance.
Operating income for the fourth quarter was $3.5 billion up 12% from a year ago. Earnings per share was $0.51 up 6% from the year ago. For full year 2013 revenue was $52.7 billion, gross margin was 60%, operating income was $12.3 billion, net income was $9.6 billion and earnings per share was $1.89. Well the PC market was down on the year, we saw the market stabilize in the back half of the year with fourth quarter PC units up from a year ago. Additionally we saw strong tablet growth in the back half of the year and inclusive of PC and tablets are unit growth in the fourth quarter was up almost 10% from a year ago. We decreased inventory levels by almost $400 million in the fourth quarter and across the worldwide supply chain, inventory levels continue to be whole.
Gross margin of approximately 60% in 2013 is down two points from 2012 driven by higher 14-nanometer factory startup cost. Spending and R&D and MG&A was $18.7 billion in 2013, 35% to revenues down from the forecasted at the beginning of the year at higher than our long term model. Operating income was $12.3 billion down 16% year-over-year.
Earnings per share was $1.89 down 11% from a year ago. The business continued to generate significant cash with almost $21 billion of cash from operations in 2013. Total cash balance at the end of the year was roughly $20 billion, up approximately $2 billion from a year ago. We purchased $11 billion in capital assets, paid $4.5 billion in dividends and repurchased over $2 billion of stock.
As we look forward to the first quarter of 2014, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $12.8 billion, down 7% from the fourth quarter. This forecast is in line with the average seasonal decline for the first quarter. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range for the first quarter to be 59%. The 3 point decline from the fourth quarter is primarily driven by higher platform write-offs as we started pre-production builds of Broadwell and 14-nanometer and overall lower platform volumes in line with seasonal trends.
Turning to 2014, we are planning for revenues to be approximately flat. We expect the Data Center Group revenue to be up in the low double-digits and PC Client Group revenue to be down in the mid-single-digits. We are forecasting the midpoint of our gross margin range at 60% flat to 2013. We expect startup cost to decline partially offset by the impact of tablets as we ramp our volume and provide contra revenue support to our customers. And we are forecasting spending for the year at $18.6 billion and expect capital spending of $11 billion both of which are approximately flat to 2013. Within the flat spending, we are advancing the strategy of the company by shifting investments towards the data center, tablets and low-power SoCs.
The fourth quarter was a solid finish to a challenging year. Financially, the fourth quarter of 2013 was better than the fourth quarter of 2012. More importantly, we are making changes that continue to improve our competitive position. For devices that compute, our vision is if it computes, it does the best with Intel. Towards that end, we are well on our way to reinventing the personal computer. With all-in-ones, 2-in-1s, convertibles and detachables, the amount of innovation in the PC market is unprecedented. Building on this leadership, we will start production of wafers on Broadwell, a 14-nanometer product targeting these form factors in the first quarter. In the tablet market, we launched the Bay Trail SoC and have started to expand our footprint and market signature in this growing market. And in the internet of things market, we are bringing new architectures like internet of thing to build on our current leadership position. We are uniquely situated to benefit from the other end of the compute continuum as the infrastructure that supports all these devices expands.
Our data center business continues to see robust growth as a result of the build out of the cloud and the exposure of devices that compute and connect to the internet. From 2013, we extended our leadership at the high end of the data center with the launch of the Ivy Bridge-based Xeon product line. And at the low end of the data center, we extended our leadership with the launch of Avoton targeting the micro-server market. We are planning to build on the foundation as we launched the Haswell-based Xeon family in 2014. At the foundation of this innovation, we continue to enhance more growth faster than the rest of the industry. This gives us the world’s highest performance and lowest power transistors and will result in a growing cost advantage over time.
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.
Mark Henninger
Alright. Thank you, Brian and Stacy. As we move on to the Q&A, as is our normal practice, we would ask each participant to ask one question and just one follow-up if you have one. Jamie, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies.
Mark Lipacis - Jefferies
Thanks for taking my question. At the Analyst Day, you addressed your view on transistor density and your expectation for leadership on that vector, but I have to say this discussing that idea with investors is a consensus view that seems to be that Intel has an inherent wafer cost disadvantage that relative to TSSC that neutralizes or more than neutralizes your transistor density advantage and the argument is that TSSC ships more wafers and therefore has more better purchasing power than you and its lower labor cost, so net-net, they have just a big huge advantage of wafer cost that you should have a hard to, too hard of a time to overcome. So my question is do you think that’s a fair view. Can you help us talk to the relative elements of the wafer cost and how you think you can compare? Any kind of help that you give us on the cost dimension would be extremely helpful. Thank you.
Brian Krzanich
You know I think the first thing to remember is that what really counts in all of this is transistor cost and what we really talk about in our Moore’s Law of Curves and when we talk about transistor density is driving a consistent cost reduction of the transistors and so wafer cost is one segment of that. I’m not going to comment on you know (indiscernible) wafer cost versus our wafer cost but we feel confident that our relative level of scaling and our internal wafer cost are such that we believe we have a leadership position in transistor cost.
When you’re talking about any product whatever it is, a logic product that’s a low-end microprocessor for wearable or internet of things or high-end Xeon server. You’re talking about the number of case and hence the number of transistors required to put that logic device together, it doesn’t matter whose technology it's on to some extent. It doesn’t matter what node and so the more cost effective those transistors are whether it's 500 million or 3 billion the lower the product cost there is and that’s really what we focus on and why we focus on transistor cost. So I think we stand by our what we said at the investor meeting.
Mark Lipacis - Jefferies
Thank you and if I could have a follow-up, there has been some news report about the Fab 42, could you help us understand what’s going on? How we should think about what’s going on there? Thank you.
Brian Krzanich
Sure I will start and then Stacy can talk to you about the financial discussion of it. You know you start these construction projects, we talked about in the past, yes it starts three years roughly in advance. They are very complex, some of the most complex if not the most complex construction projects you could imagine. If you start those three years in advance so when you’re ready for operation. We started this one about three years ago, if you go back and look three years ago our view of the PC Industry and PC growth it was you know much more robust than what has played out and is our forecast today and so what we have done as we have brought it online as we have been very conservative with our how we manage the project, we brought it up and so the shell is complete and facilitating from a construction standpoint and we have held back putting equipment in and so we see the demand requirement and that’s really what we have done. We’ve done that in the past, you can I have been in Intel’s manufacturing for 30 years. You can go back in time and we did that fairly frequently and that’s what we have done with Fab 42 as well. We have held it back until the demand requirement comes about.
Stacy Smith
Well don’t have a lot to add to that. I would just say that that financial impact of this is actually pretty minimal. As Brian said we have built a shell but we didn’t equip it and we did that before we needed we will ultimately use it to the economic cost is just time value of the money which is pretty modest cost and this is pretty normal for us since, we actually always want to have some preposition space to grow into as the market grows. As Brian said it's three years to construct one of these things so it's economically quite detrimental to get cut short and the cost of having all those extra spaces is pretty high. Doesn’t impact depreciation, doesn’t impact gross margin.

The next question comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
I guess the first one is on DCG. Can you give us a little more color what happened in the fourth quarter especially given the confidence that you had as recently as November and the growth there and also what gives you confidence given the fourth quarter miss in forecasting still a low digit growth in 2014?
Stacy Smith
So if you look at the trends in the fourth quarter I think the trends actually reinforce the growth rate among cloud, high performance computing, networking storage they all came in consistent with what we thought Brian went through a lot on the year-over-year growth rates there so very robust growth rate. So it actually increased our confidence in that. What we saw very specific to the enterprise was we did return to growth, it was a little bit less growth than what we had thought as we entered the quarter. As we kind of step back and look at what happened there, we think there is two elements that hit us. One was we had a pretty robust growth rate in Q3. As we entered Q4, we saw that we had there is more inventory out in the world than we knew when we started the quarter so that had to be burned off. And then secondly, we saw a tapering off in order patterns across certain customers in certain segments at the end of the quarter and we think that, that was driven by the government shutdown and the uncertainty around the debt too, because when you look at the customers in the segments, it’s pretty clearly in those segments. We had a range around growth rates for 2014 in the investor meeting with 10% to 15% based on a slower growth in enterprise in Q4 and maybe a slower recovery in enterprise over the course of 2014, I would say we are now at the lower end of that range. So we are more at the 10% range than the 15% part of that range.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Great. And I guess as my follow-on switching gears a little bit to the OpEx side, you guided sequentially flat, but it looks like if you just hold R&D as part of that sequentially flat, for the full year, it seems to imply that R&D as a singular expense will be coming down as the year progresses, is that math correct and if so what’s driving that decline throughout the year?
Brian Krzanich
Yes, that math is correct. So I think Q1 will be the high point in terms of quarterly spending, it will come down quarter by quarter. We will be bringing employment down over the course of the year. And beyond that, as we talked about at the investor meeting, we are going to be making some significant new investments and things like the data center tablets, low power SoCs those kinds of things. So even beyond the headline number, there was going to be kind of a significant shift in investments over the course of the year, but you have the math right and it’s going to be due to just shifting on projects than bringing down employment over the course of 2014.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Okay, thank you.
Brian Krzanich
Thanks Ross.
Operator
Your next question comes from Glen Yeung from Citi.
Glen Yeung - Citi
Alright, thanks. Brian or Stacy either one, to what extent could you be misreading the enterprise server market in the sense that the virtualization curve is probably now over and maybe you don’t see the recovery in enterprise server with the economy that one might normally see?
Brian Krzanich
Okay. I think we would say there is some impact. To answer, we are showing a kind of long-term growth rate in enterprise that’s less than what it was three years ago. I think as you said there was some impact associated with the virtualization curve having played out, but that doesn’t stop the fact that we think that there is growth in the enterprise segment. We have just changed our view for 2014. We think the recovery just plays out a bit slower than we would have thought a quarter ago.
Glen Yeung - Citi
Okay. And then kind of similar question on the PC side, to what extent do you think that the strength you are seeing, relative strength you are seeing in PCs today, is it a function of the software transition at Microsoft and does it therefore end in April or do you think this is a more sustainable recovery?
Brian Krzanich
So as we said in our script that what drove a lot of it was desktop and we are seeing the mature markets enterprise is the strongest with the emerging markets still flat to slightly down. So our view that if you look out from a PC perspective was that we forecast with a relatively cautious and careful view looking out. We compared against the third parties. We think we are in line with what third-parties have forecasted as well. Some of the contributions of fourth quarter was the XP transition, which is really what you are talking about. We don’t think that was the only thing. As I said, it was most – lot of the growth came from desktop, but the desktop was largely enterprise in the mature markets. That really we think has to do with a lot of great form factors that are coming in the all-in-ones, the great innovation that’s coming in there. We saw some of the highest units of i5 and i7 in the enthusiast area. I think those are some great gamming platforms. So we think there is a lot more to the desktop growth. We also introduced the Haswell-based NUC, which is a smallest form factor desktop machine that you can have. So it’s those kinds of innovations that are driving this desktop growth as much and more than the software transition.
Glen Yeung - Citi
That’s great. Thank you very much.
Operator
The next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Sanford Bernstein.
Stacy Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co
I want to dig into the full year guidance a little bit; there is something I don’t understand. See you just basically took your data center guidance down for 2014 by a little bit. It doesn’t sound like you’re taking; you’re improving your full year PC guidance at all. You’re still saying kind of like single digits and you didn’t take your full year revenue outlook down. So what’s making up a difference? And if there is nothing making up the difference why didn’t you take the full year revenue guidance down?
Stacy Smith
Yeah I think Stacy you’re assuming a level of precision around approximately flat that doesn’t exist you know approximately flat can cut us a little bit up, a little bit down. If you think about the data center being $10 billion if we’re at the higher end of the range versus the lower end of the range that we put out here you changed the full year on a $50 billion plus business by a few $100 million.
Stacy Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co
So is the bias like more to a little bit down versus a little bit up at least more than it was in November?
Stacy Smith
At this point again you’re assuming a level of precision that I think isn't appropriate when you’re talking something that you know will play out over the next 12 months. Yeah we had a positive data point on PCs, we had a little bit of a negative data point on one element of the enterprise, our tablet momentum looks good, so you just kind of look at it and I would say our view is pretty consistent with what it was back in November.
Operator
The next question comes from Christopher Danely from JPMorgan.
Christopher Danely – JPMorgan
My first question is on gross margin so you gave us the Q1 and the full year guidance, can you just talk about how things are supposed to trend after Q1 and then maybe also talk about some of the levers on gross margins up or down?
Stacy Smith
Well I will anchor it on Q1 and then give you a sense of how I see it pulling out over the course of the year since we provided specific guidance for Q1. We have guided Q1 at 59% coming down from Q4 it was 62% in Q4 so down to 59. The elements that bring us down we have about a 1.5 down associated with the start of production on Broadwell prior to it's qualification for sale so you’ve seen this from us in the past that build [ph] will be reserved out and so we have reached the formal qualification day. And then we’re about a point down in Q1 as a result of it just being like seasonally lower quarter and so yeah I think you kind of understand and expect both of those, 60% for the year or so, algebra would say an improving gross margin over the course of the year. I think when we get into the back half of the year we have a gross margin back into the low 60s. But I think about the headwinds and tailwinds to that you know the tailwinds are that we expect that we will see a falling off 14-nanometer startup cost. We talked about that at the investor meeting and I think that’s consistent with what you would expect from us. We see volume and unit cost getting better over the course of the year and reserve will get a bit better as we progress through the year. Again we have these Broadwell reserve in the first quarter.
The big offset to that have been are the dollars that we’re providing in terms of contra revenue dollars for tablets. We also talked about it in some depth at the investor meeting. We’re not seeing a lot of those in the first quarter, they really build over the course of the year so we have the positives that I outlined and then you will see that offset as a result of you know there is temporary contra revenue dollars that we’re providing to our customers as we take our tablets product volume kind of broadly through the different OSs and price points.
Christopher Danely – JPMorgan
Great and for my follow-up I guess it's kind of on that question. So on the tablet strategy to get the 40 million you’re saying it's going to be a 1.5 percentage hit. Let’s say you guys get into the second half of the year and you’re not quite to the 40 million if it's a pretty significant short fall. Would you consider canning that strategy I guess I’m just wondering what the commitment is if the volumes aren’t there but the cost is there by the end of the year?
Brian Krzanich
Sure. This isn't a price reduction as normal price reduction would be; it's not where you are just simply reducing. It's truly a BOM cost equalizer and remember a lot of our 40 million tablets in ’14 will be based on Bay Trail. Bay Trail was originally designed for Avoton-based PC segments and the upper end tablet. And so it’s what we are doing here is doing a BOM cast delta relative to the, what the mid and lower end tablets require. And so those are things like Bay Trail may require more layers of a printed circuit board for the board itself, more components on the board and tighter power management controls and things like that. We have a whole program to reduce those throughout the year. So that gives us confidence that as we go through the year, the BOM cast delta will shrink, but if the volume didn’t show up for some reason and I am not going to say that, that’s what’s going to happen, but I am confident it will, but if it didn’t it’s on a per unit basis. And so the spending on that contra would be reduced equivalently.
Stacy Smith
And I would just add as Brian said we are doing a lot of enabling across the industry to take the BOM cast out in equivalent. These are costs at the system level not at our chip level and it will vary a lot by SKU, but to give you a sense for a Bay Trail platform from the beginning of the year to the end of the year we think that, that BOM penalty drops by more than half. And so it kind of gets better out in time. And then when we get to the Broxton generation we think it’s de minimis.
Brian Krzanich
Yes, both Broxton and SoFIA are just specifically designed to eliminate that delta.
Christopher Danely - JPMorgan
Got it. Okay, thanks a lot guys. That’s very helpful.
Brian Krzanich
Sure.
Stacy Smith
Thanks Chris.

Your next question comes from Tristan Gerra from Baird.
Tristan Gerra - Baird
Hi good afternoon. If we look at tablets and smartphone, what type of units do you need to reach for that business to stop having a material impact in gross margin from is 10 points higher utilization rates and excluding the contra revenue impact and that’s it?
Brian Krzanich
You were asking tablets and phones?
Tristan Gerra - Baird
Yes. So just looking at the 40 million units target for this year, what type of volume do you need to get in order for gross margin to start appreciating from the west of the business if you exclude the contra revenue impact?
Brian Krzanich
Yes, it’s hard to say. I mean, I will bridge back to our strategy here. Our strategy is that we are going to use our process technology leads. We will have leadership products that also are competitive or maybe even leadership in terms of cost and I showed some data at the investor meeting that just kind of showed the die size as we progress from Bay Trail to Broxton to SoFIA and so you can get a sense of the kinds of cost structure that we are going to have on a per unit basis. I don’t think it causes on a percentage basis. Yes, I can’t – I am not envisioning if this causes the gross margin percentage to go up, but you can definitely get to a space once we get through these contra enabling dollars where every unit we sell is accretive on a gross margin dollars per unit. It’s utilizing factories that we have in place for PCs. And so it’s a nice adder of that gross margin dollar per unit standpoint.
Tristan Gerra - Baird
Okay. And then a quick follow up, you talked about enterprise desktop being strong, any color that you can provide in notebooks in terms of whether it’s right in line with expectation and whether was it more driven by consumer or enterprise?
Brian Krzanich
It was pretty much in line with the expectation. We didn’t see any surprise on the notebook side result, overall PC units a little bit higher and that was really desktop and that was as Brian said broad-based across desktops. So all-in-ones and corporate and consumer everything was just a little stronger on the desktop side.
Tristan Gerra - Baird
Great, thank you.
Operator
The next question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
Yes, good afternoon guys. Congratulations on solid result. Brian, I guess my first question relative to the seasonal guide for the March quarter, is there any sort of granularity you can give us between sort of the PC Group, the Data Center Group and kind of other IA and I guess the reason why I am asking the question is I get in the absence of knowing just guiding the seasonal makes sense, but you do have Bay Trail Android tablets in Q1 that you didn’t have in Q4. And then when you look at the availability of SKUs in the PC Group, you obviously have a lot better availability of kind of the SKUs, I think people like in Q1 versus Q4, both of which would kind of argue for better seasonality. So maybe you can give us a little granularity that will be helpful?
Brian Krzanich
Sure. Let me try and if you can add some of the financial detail. Part of it is, let’s go back, it’s seasonality off growth on Q4 right? So a stronger Q4. So it's a good quarter, I don’t want to say that just growing at seasonality is not a good thing. Second thing I would say is you’re right on the PC we do see a lot of the 2-in-1s come in but also Q1 is just you know there is not a lot of events that happen that can drive upsides like holidays and things like that. Now in one of your comments you said we will start seeing Bay Trail Android tablets. Most of the Bay Trail Android tablets really start showing up more in Q2 than in Q1 and that’s again purely you know remember we made a shift, an original program for Bay Trail was all Windows. As we came into the midpoint of the year we sandbox [ph] shift and make it Windows and Android and so you know our OEM partners as well are targeting more towards Q2 and it's just when you do you go and start putting back in that back to school event which is a next seasonal place where upside usually occur.
Stacy Smith
The only thing I would add to that, sorry, I guess I would say I certainly hope you’re right and it's better than seasonal and we have all of the ability in the world to respond to that. So that is a being good answer. The thing you might want to keep in mind is you work through seasonality over the course of the year as that these contra revenue dollars that we’re providing to the customers for a tablet enabling, that will come off of revenue so it's a gross margin hit but it will also be a decrement to revenue while we support them. So it's not so much a key to issue but to get into the back half it's going to be one of the minuses out there.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
That’s helpful and then guys just relative to DCG, at the Analyst Day in November you talked about your expectation for enterprise kind of being I believe a 7% or 8% type long term growth. I know relative to Glen’s question around virtualization you answered that. I guess my question is have you taken into account sort of cloud and enterprise is kind of offloading infrastructure into the cloud. I know at the Analyst Day we talked about two thirds of cloud growth being consumer and not business if you start to lose dollars in enterprise to cloud is it kind of a one to one loss if you lose in enterprise, you will just make it up in cloud or how do I think about that dynamic?
Stacy Smith
I think it's close enough for government work. If that’s how it plays out it should be you know dollar for dollar, close enough that you don’t care. One of the phenomenon that we have seen is that we have seen the mix in the cloud actually moving up so if you look at the ASP impact inside of servers John, it's more driven by cloud than anything else right now and so they are a buying a richer and richer mix and that’s why I think you’re probably pretty close if you start to see an offload that way and utilization rates inside the enterprise tend to be pretty high on the kinds of things that they move into the cloud. So you know I think you’re pretty close to one to one.

The next question comes from Alex Gauna from JMP Securities.
Alex Gauna - JMP Securities
I was wondering if you could talk about how you see Asia specifically and what’s going on for you with the holiday build there and how that’s factoring in to your Q1 expectations? Thank you.
Brian Krzanich
We like we said in Q4 we saw Asia continue to be soft. We have built-in a seasonal growth; we don’t expect anything big to shift there. We see Asia continuing to; they will have that same seasonal growth as well. The forecast stands; we don’t see anything different occurring there so to speak.
Alex Gauna - JMP Securities
Is there any evidence within your build and your ODM build into the server market that I know some of that’s coming back to service data center but what about the opportunity in Asia for them to become a stronger data center enterprise customer going forward?
Brian Krzanich
Certainly I mean if you look at one of the places we look at for data center growth and we’re seeing it for both but I mean it's across enterprise, cloud is growing very well. Lot of the cloud growth is driven out of Asia. You know we absolutely see Asia as a growth area for the data center in general.
Stacy Smith
Exactly and I would just say on the client side, we think what we’re seeing in Asia is just that the tablet penetration rate increased that’s offset by a couple of years from what we saw in mature markets and so that’s why and we’re seeing some stabilization and improvement in mature markets. It's ahead of emerging markets is we have just reached saturation points on tablet penetration and then the emerging markets are still increasing. It’s much more of a client phenomenon than a datacenter phenomenon.
Alex Gauna - JMP Securities
Would you expect the lag in Asia to be driven more by Bay Trail later on in the year or Haswell?
Brian Krzanich
Hey, I must appreciate the question, but we are trying to get it for everybody. Thank you.
Alex Gauna - JMP Securities
Thank you. That’s helpful.

The next question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America
Thanks for taking my question. So first on the smartphone or on tablet space, I think it is true that Intel has a manufacturing lead, but do you think your cost reduction efforts and then the Moore’s Law advantages ever progressed faster than the ASP declines in the space. In other words, do you think Intel can be sustainably profitable in the mobile space which is maturing?
Brian Krzanich
Yes, we absolutely do. You saw at the investor meeting products like SoFIA, which really are going to be put on to 14-nanometer are fully integrated all the way through with the 3G option or an LTE option and that LTE is with carrier aggregation. Those kinds of products we believe are very, very cost competitive in fact leading from a cost position. In addition, we don’t talk a lot about, but we are already in that low cost Asia market. We are inch and then we are working with ODMs there. That’s actually where a lot of the innovations coming out of for some of these cost reductions on tablets and where we are getting the cost reduction ideas. So we are in that market now. We sold out of that Shenzhen low cost market in Q4. We will continue though it – through 2014 and with products like SoFIA on leading edge technology, we are very comfortable that we can get into those very low price points.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America
Thanks Brian. And as for my follow-up, there seems to be these ways to provide 64-bit capability and application processor, then I think you guys have always had 64-bit support with that and like in fact all your products. So the question is what do you think is a value proposition of 64-bit and how can you leverage your 64-bit capabilities to win market share a little bit?
Brian Krzanich
Sure, you are right. All of our products have always been 64-bit including Atom. And so OEMs who build with our products now can already go out and start to utilize 64-bit. We are out there working with the OSs, all of the OSs and the OEMs to go enable that. The real usages and the values are going to be in those high compute areas, things like video, things like media, transfer media manipulation. All the classic things around computing that you saw drive the compute cycles on PC and people are doing more and more with tablets and phones or that will be the same things that drive 64-bit utilization on these mobile devices. I think you will also see it in insecurity. All of those things are going to drive a desire for 64-bit.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America
Okay, thank you.
Operator
The next question comes from Mike McConnell from Pacific Crest.
Mike McConnell - Pacific Crest
Thanks. I wanted to ask about again going back to enterprise and DCG, since you said that some of the fall-off late in the quarter was due to some of the government issues shutdown and debt ceiling, etcetera and now that the debt deal has been reached, have you gotten any feedback from some of these enterprise customers that they are feeling more comfortable now with respect to re-spend?
Stacy Smith
We will watch it over the first quarter. I think the headline here is that the first half of the year we saw an enterprise market that was declining and we got into the back half of the year, it was growing. It was just growing a little less fast than we thought and the recovery was a little less fast than we thought. My expectation is we will see that segment kind of pop back to the normal rate. I would also think that we were just a bit ahead of ourselves in terms of how fast the enterprise market was going to recover and grow. So we have a little bit more of a cautious view of that as we progressed through 2014. So I guess the short answer is, yes, I’d expect that piece to come back. I still believe we’ll be at the lower end of the guidance. We are probably just a little overheated in Q4.
Mike McConnell - Pacific Crest
I understand. And then my follow-up would be just, Stacy, can you remind us about linearity in DCG, I guess, would we have to wait till the second half of ‘14 to kind of see the reacceleration or do you think we could still see growth in the first half of the year? Thanks.
Stacy Smith
No. I think you will see, I think you will see year-on-year growth. I mean remember DCG is, the order pattern particularly with some of these big cloud customers can be very lumpy but when you step back and look it on a year-on-year basis I think we will see year-on-year growth rates. It's kind of progressed through the year.
Mike McConnell - Pacific Crest
Sequentially though as well or that’s?
Stacy Smith
Sequentially it will be more based on kind of abnormal seasonality but again for DCG you might be (indiscernible) sense it's always year-on-year growth rates tends to be more meaningful indicator.
Operator
The next question comes from Hans Mosesmann from Raymond James.
Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James
Brian real simple if you can, can you split out the types of servers that you sent or shipped in the quarter via you know enterprise networking if you can provide that level of granularity. Thanks.
Stacy Smith
Yeah we don’t provide that level of granularity but if you go back to Brian’s prepared there is a safety, go back to Brian’s prepared remarks what you heard a lot of data on year-on-year growth rates across cloud, networking, high-performance computing and then I’m giving you for the enterprise piece it was growth, it was just the lower level of growth than we thought. So it's pretty, if you go back to the investor meeting stuff and then take what Brian showed you what you will see is for all those other segments was very consistent with how we modeled it. Enterprise growth a little bit less growth.
Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James
Okay and then as a follow-up the Broadwell SoC, I mean still second half of ’14?
Brian Krzanich
Yes I said that you know we had made great progress on our 40 nanometer yield than we were actually very happy with the results that we got out of Q4 and we’re squarely on target for our second half launch and for and as Stacy said starting production in Q1.
Operator
The final question comes from Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs
I know that on the PC and the pickup in desktops you had said it wasn’t all corporate refresh but obviously some of it was. Is there any chance that you know enterprise just had a fixed budget and some more of it went to the corporate refresh in the fourth quarter and so you know they had a little bit less to spend on the data center and you know that could account for some of the delta there?
Brian Krzanich
We don’t have a single that suggest that Jim you know from what we have heard from the OEMs and the customers is more around like Stacy said a little bit of inventory coming into Q3 and in the Q4 and then the government shutdown and if you looked at the order pattern it will kind of follow that from what we can tell on the, from our position as well.
Stacy Smith
And I would just add to that as Brian said earlier we have had record shipments in the desktop on the core i7, we know that SKU is not an enterprise SKU at all, that’s a customer SKU. So our data as we look across was consumer was strong, all-in-ones were strong. So lot of i7 was strong, a lot of things that we know don’t go and the enterprise were strong. So I don’t think that was the driver of what happened in the client side of enterprise and we don’t have any data points that would suggest that was what happened on the server side of enterprise.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs
Yeah if I could just on quickly on the follow-up on the tablet, could you give us some perspective on the design wins that are not being supported by the contra revenue? In other words sort of maybe a split between design win activity that is supported by contra revenue versus ones that aren’t?
Brian Krzanich
Yeah I mean we can’t go into specifics of each one.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs
No sure, maybe just percentages or something.
Brian Krzanich
But I would say the majority of the projects that we have in 2014 use some level of contra revenue to bring their BOMs, their Bill of Materials or actually we don’t use our acronyms everywhere. Their Bill of Materials it's a parity and so it's really is very SKU by SKU dependent. It's not a fixed number out there. We work with each OEM and that’s how I’m comfortable that we’re going to work this out over the next year or so. We work with each OEM depending on what you know are they try getting a high end SKU or midrange SKU or low level SKU? What type of display and graphics and all of those things they want to put in that system. We have a delta involved that we’re working out and so we go and work with them on that and it's literally at that level, SKU by SKU.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to your Intel Corporation Q3 2013 Earnings Conference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Mark Henninger. Sir, you may begin your conference.
Mark Henninger
Thank you, Nova, and welcome everyone to Intel's third quarter 2013 conference call. By now you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with that. If you have not received both documents, they are currently available currently on our Investor website, intc.com. I am joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we will hear brief remarks from both of them followed by Q&A.
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussions contain forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, it does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Also if, during this call, we use any non-GAAP financial measures or references, we will post the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliation to our website, intc.com.
And finally, I would like to remind everyone that we will be hosting our Investor Day here at our Santa Clara headquarters on November 21. If you have questions about the event or the logistics, please contact Investor Relations.
So with that, let me hand the call over to Brian.
Brian Krzanich
Thanks, Mark. During the third quarter, our revenue grew 5% sequentially and was flat versus the third quarter of 2012. Year-over-year PC CPU volume declines slowed and were offset by solid growth in the data center and enterprise. While consumer demand in emerging markets was sluggish, we started to see early signs of improvement in North America and Western Europe. I see our performance in this environment as evidence of an increasingly broad and diverse product portfolio. I would like to highlight a few of the most important results from the quarter.
Following the launch of Ivy Bridge EP and the Atom-based Avoton SoCs, the Data Center group delivered all-time record revenue. DCG saw strength across its lines of business and geographies. Cloud revenue was up 40% year-over-year, storage was up 20%, and high performance computing was up 27%. Even traditional enterprise servers were up a bit over the last year on the strength of our MP product line.
While the Data Center Group's results demonstrate some of Intel's core capabilities, we saw strong performance beyond DCG. Our embedded business grew 21% year-over-year, reaching an all-time record for revenue driven by communications infrastructure, transportation, the internet of things, and retail. Embedded revenue is well on its way to a double-digit growth year.
Just a few weeks ago, we announced our newest product family, Quark, an ultra-low power and low-cost architecture. And while any significant revenue impact is some time away, the architecture and the speed with which we are bringing it to market are evidence of the changes we are making to ensure we are in a better position to lead and define technology trends moving forward.
Finally, our NAND business grew 20% over last year. As enterprise and data center customers increasing use of high-performance SSDs have put this segment on a path to double-digit growth for the year. We continue to make progress with the industry's first 14 -nanometer manufacturing process and our second-generation 3D transistors. Broadwell, the first product on 14 nanometers is up and running as we demonstrated at the Intel Developer Forum last month.
While we are comfortable with where we are at with yields, from a timing standpoint, we are about a quarter behind our projections. As a result, we are now planning to begin production in the first quarter of next year.
In the Wireless business, I was pleased with our progress on LTE. Our multimode data modem is now available in the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. By the end of the year, we expect to have voice-over-LTE versions available for customers and our second generation of voice-over-LTE product with carrier aggregation will be available in the first half of next year.
Over the past couple of months, we have also launched 15 new 22-nanometer Atom SoCs. These products are designed for markets ranging from consumer tablets to cloud data centers. During the holiday selling season, you will see Atom SoCs and tablets as low as $99, and in 2-in-1 systems as low as $349.
At the same time, you will also find Haswell Systems with outstanding performance and 50% better battery life using Windows 8, Mac OS, and Chrome as low as $299. Together, Bay Trail and Haswell are making possible a range of innovative new form factors at breakthrough price points.
The past few years have seen dramatic changes in the way consumers use and interact with technology, and those trends aren't slowing down. While preferences for form factor OS’s and price points have evolved, the market’s appetite for computing has continued to grow.
We are going into the fourth quarter with the broadest portfolio in Intel's history, positioned to fully participate in all of that growth.
With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.
Stacy Smith
Thanks, Brian. The third quarter revenue came in as expected and gross margin was slightly better than the mid-point of the forecasted range. Third quarter revenue came in at $13.5 billion, up 5% from the second quarter. At the segment level, the PC Client Group grew 4%, sequentially, and the Data Center Group grew 6%. The Data Center Group returned to double-digit year-on-year growth in the third quarter growing 12% from a year ago. As expected, inventory levels across the worldwide PC supply chain grew slightly as customers built Haswell-based PCs, but inventory levels are still being managed well below historical averages.
For the fourth quarter of 2013, we are forecasting the mid-point of the revenue range at $13.7 billion, up 2% from the third quarter. Relative to the historical seasonal increase, the fourth quarter forecast reflects the orders we are receiving from our customers and their desire to keep inventory levels lean.
Moving to gross margin, third quarter gross margin of 62% was up 4 points from the second quarter and up 1 point from our guidance. The increase from the second quarter was as a result of lower platform unit costs, higher platform revenue, and lower write-offs. In addition, factory start-up costs came down in the third quarter as spending on process engineers was reclassified from cost of sales to R&D.
For the fourth quarter, we expect gross margin to decrease by 1 point to 61% as we increase factory spending on 14 nanometer. For the third quarter, spending was down $100 million from expectations and flat from the second quarter at $4.7 billion. The $100 million decrease from expectations was as a result of a lot of small actions across the company to reduce spending. For the fourth quarter, we are forecasting spending consistent with the third quarter at $4.7 billion.
In order to better align resources with our priorities, during the third quarter we approved and communicated several restructuring actions. Restructuring charges in the third quarter were just north of $100 million and we expect restructuring in the fourth quarter to be roughly flat. Operating income for the third quarter was $3.5 billion with earnings per share of $0.58.
Taking a look at the balance sheet, total cash investments ended the quarter at $19.1 billion, up $1.8 billion from the second quarter. In the third quarter, we generated approximately $6 billion in cash from operations, paid approximately $1 billion in dividends, purchased almost $3 billion in capital assets, and repurchased over $0.5 billion in stock.
Inventories were flat from the second quarter. The fourth quarter revenue forecast of up 2% reflects the caution we are seeing from our customers due to weak consumer end markets for the PC segment of our business. That said, we are seeing some important positive trends. The enterprise market for PCs strengthened in the third quarter and the consumer markets in the U.S. and Europe appear to have bottomed out. Our Data Center business returned to double digit year-on-year growth based on a resumption of growth in the enterprise market segment and continued robust growth in cloud, high-performance computing, and storage.
From a product perspective, we have an unprecedented line-up of products coming to the market this holiday season. Haswell delivers a historical increase in battery life across the diverse lineup of ultra-mobile form factors by like 2-in-1 convertibles, tablets, and other touch enabled devices. We are also starting to see our customers come to market with Bay Trail based designs that will further extend our product line across screen sizes and price points in both tablets and PCs. This extension of our product lineup across devices, price points, and operating systems positions us to grow our business across a broad range of compute devices.
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.
Mark Henninger
Alright. Thank you, Brian and Stacy. Moving on to Q&A, as is our normal practice we would ask each participant to ask one question and just one follow-up, if you have one. Nova, would you like to go ahead and introduce our first question please?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley
Great, thank you. Can you talk about the future client market, if you look a the IDC data, they actually showed sequential growth was a little higher than yours. So I know you have got tired of us asking all the time why you guys were above them when they were negative, just any reconciliation that you could give us on – they looked like they showed 8% sequential growth, a reconciliation of their numbers to yours.
Stacy Smith
Joy, I think when you get into the quarter-on-quarter movements, its hard to tie out. When we look at their view of the year and our view of the year, it still is roughly in line. So it could come down to just what's happening in the inventory pipeline, sometime differences come down to what's happening in China. But I think we are pretty aligned with their view. Remember, our unit growth will be a little higher than what they show in their headline PC number because our unit growth will include things like tablets and 2-in-1’s and things like that.
Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley
Great, and then the comment that inventories in the PC supply chain built slightly sequentially, but it is still below normal. Can you characterize what's going on there and where do you expect that to go over the course for the rest of this year?
Stacy Smith
Yes, I think it's a continuation, Joe, of what we have seen over the last four or five quarters that our customers are managing the worldwide inventory of PC supply to lean levels. I think it's a reflection of just how dynamic the industry is and in some of the markets how volatile it is, so they are keeping inventory levels low. That was true in Q2. It's true in Q3, and the expectation in Q4 is that people will continue to manage things lean. I would say for our own inventory levels, you know, we have taken $1 billion-plus out of our aggregate inventory, it was relatively flat quarter-on-quarter. Again, as I think about Q4, I think we will keep our inventory levels flat-to-down from this.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis of Barclays. Your line is open.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays
If you could just provide some general color on when you look at your outlook of plus-2 within desktops, notebooks, and servers, did you expect all three segments to grow into December? Thanks.
Brian Krzanich
Sure. This is Brian. We don't see those as varying greatly amongst them, so we see all of those segments growing as we move into the fourth quarter. As we said in our prepared statements, what we saw in the third quarter and we believe will move into the fourth quarter as well is stabilization in what I will call the mature markets, the U.S., Western Europe, and with Asia and especially China still remains relatively volatile, and that's where we see the growth as well as in mature and emerging Western Europe and U.S. markets.
Stacy Smith
If I can get some color on the server portion, Brian, was talking about the clients there. In the server market, we saw nice unit growth in Q3, and I would actually expect that unit growth on a year-over-year basis to accelerate in Q4, so I think we will have an acceleration of server, DCG revenue growth when we get into the fourth quarter and that will be significantly above the corporate average.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays
Thanks for that. Then maybe a little early on Bay Trail, but if you could just talk about the customer adoption and then any early indications of sales of those products, and then as you look at just kind of touch-enabled device, have those expectations of adoption of that progressed through the year and as you look into the holiday season?
Brian Krzanich
Sure. This is again, Brian. Remember, Bay Trail has always been a second half and really a late second half introduction product and that was a pull-in, so we pulled that in in order to bring it into 2013. We’ve seen great adoption. We have over 50 design wins with about half of those being 2-in-1 devices. We’ve talked about those devices hitting new price points. The other place Bay Trail is going into is tablets. We think that by Black Friday, you will see 8 to 10 SKUs on shelf, so that's the last thing we had hoped for, but that still shows – the 50 design win shows really strong adoption.
The second part of your question was around touch, which is a broader question. We continue to see touch adoption growing month-by-month as the price points come down, and the price points at are now is below $50. We have put touch as a requirement for the fourth-generation Core Ultrabooks, and you are seeing Bay Trail clamshells with touch enabled at $299, which is a new real price point for touch-enabled devices, so we see it continuing to grow as we enter next year.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Wang of Evercore. Your line is open.
Patrick Wang - Evercore
Great. Thanks a lot. You guys talked a lot about traction in your low-priced tablets, Chromebooks, handset, handset. Even you talked about Avoton and low power server. Your notebook ASP, I think, was also down slightly year-over-year. Can you give us some perspective on the trajectory of your ASPs longer term, and then -- I mean is there something that really concerns you guys?
Stacy Smith
ASP for us will really be a function of mix. I think, we have a very strong competitive position. When you think about the server segment of our business, the core segment of our product line, I think the pricing within the bands in those markets is pretty stable. We haven’t been increasing pricing even at that time period where our ASP increases has just been a function of mix. If I think out the next couple years, what is think often is is you will see those higher end price bands were driving for some low level of growth. You will see faster growth at the low end price bands and then you will see faster growth in the server segment of our business. And how it plays out to the average is going to be a function of mix.
The thing you don't want to lose here though, and we have talked about before is that we have very different cost structures among the different segments of the business. So for us, Bay Trail effect has a lower ASP, it isn’t necessarily a bad thing relative to a Celeron, but it also has a much better cost structure relative to the Celeron.
Patrick Wang - Evercore
I understand. Okay, thanks very much for that and then also, I think you talked about delays of Broadwell production by quarter. If you had ramped it this quarter, what would the impact have been to gross margins? I guess, in other words, what is some of the things we should think about when that production actually ramps?
Stacy Smith
So, no impact to Q3 gross margin. I think you are going to see that on reconciliation. And no impact to Q4 gross margin from what we are expecting. As I kind of telegraphed on the call last time, 14-nanometer spending was projected and will increase quarter-on-quarter. That will be about 0.5 point decrement to gross margin, but that's the same decrement. It will probably hit us in different buckets, but it's the same impact in gross margin.
Patrick Wang - Evercore
Okay, and nothing different in the first quarter?
Stacy Smith
Yes, I also would give you the same answer as I think about 2014. Roughly speaking, the spending on 14-nanometer is going to be the same, which means that the gross margin impact over the course of 2014 will be the same as it was. Again, it may hit in different buckets, but it will be the same gross margin impact.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman of RBC Capital.
Doug Freedman - RBC Capital
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And Stacy, if I could just build on that a little bit going through. Can you give us an idea of what type of startup charges we are going to weather next year?
Stacy Smith
Yes, that's probably a better conversation for the investor meeting that’s in a month. I will start to give some of the puts and takes in 2014 gross margin and how we are viewing the business. But it is related back to the question that was just asked on the 14-nanometer push. So let me walk you through a little bit about the categorization in Q4, which may give you some insight into how this could play out.
As I said and as Brian said, we are moving production on 14 nanometer out about a quarter. We are seeing an increase in 14 nanometer spending in Q4 as we would have expected. What we thought a quarter ago and what I telegraphed on the call is, that as that spending increases and we start production, we move cost from startup to production costs, but then we reserve it out. And if you remember last quarter on the call, I said expect some headwinds in Q4 to gross margin because we would have an increase in reserves. Well, as we push the production date, what you will see is the same impact on gross margin but in Q4 there is likely to be a little bit of an increase in startup cost and then you won't see the reserve impact that we had expected a quarter ago. So slightly different buckets. I still expect next year you will see a reduction in startup cost. It maybe a little less than what we have seen in other even number years but then you will see an offset on the other side of that of reserves, and so the same gross margin impact over the course of the year.
Doug Freedman - RBC Capital
Great. So my follow-up, Brian, could you give us an idea of your first couple of quarters here and we have noticed clearly, with Quark and your move to try to make the company move a little quicker, we are now having restructuring charges. What are those restructuring charges targeted at and what might be some the trigger points that you have to make you move the shift in a different direction? Is the slowdown in PCs or notebooks? Is there a trigger point that makes you change the way in which you attack some of these businesses?
Brian Krzanich
Sure. So first I would separate a bit the restructuring charges from our desire to move quicker and into broader markets. Restructuring charges were mostly around the shutdown of the Hudson, Massachusetts factory. That was really talking about a factory, that was our last 200 millimeter factory on 130 nanometer. That factory had just finished its life as factory and it couldn't be upgraded to 14-nanometers, so that what most of that was. In general, restructuring charges aren't necessarily driven by how you move an organization like this into innovative new areas.
For me, the way I look at this is, this is really about pushing our architecture in both directions. It's moving down and moving Atom to be more integrated, more capable with higher graphics and higher connectivity. Then moving up on the data center side with more robust products there, more integration up there and more unique products by customers and by workload to target those areas that can utilize our core technology.
The trigger pose for me as we move through these is really around how fast the organization able to adapt, so we have a process coming where we want to be able to adjust products, because we believe these markets haven't been changing up until the last minute before you shipped something, so three or four months before product is going to shipped, we want to get to a point where we could make changes in the characteristics of those products and we are always away from that maybe a year, year-and-a-half, but we believe we can get to a place where we have to kind of flexibility and IT configuration that we can do that.
Stacy Smith
I think that I will give Brian a little more credit revenue he is giving himself. He is right there in the restructuring piece, the asset impairment is almost entirely driven by the factory. The larger portion of that is the people movement piece of it and I think Brian and Renee are both, moving fast in terms of picking areas where they want to make investment, picking areas where we are going to invest less and so that's the lion share of that particularly line item and in almost all of the Q4 number is just as we are looking to move people from one part of the company to make investments in area where we think we are going to get an enhanced return.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your line is open, sir.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
Brian just a follow-up on the Broadwell. I am just kind of curious why the push out? Can you elaborate a little bit? Is this is technical issue and if it is, why are you confident you overcame it or is this really a market issue? I.e. there's a little bit excessive Ivy Bridge inventory which is pushing out Haswell, which is the ramp, which is pushing Broadwell. If you could elaborate on that that would be great.
Brian Krzanich
Sure. It's absolutely not the latter. It was simply a defect density issue. This was on the issue -- as we develop these technologies, what you are doing? You are continually improving the defect densities and those resulted in the yield, the number of die per wafer that you get out of the product and what happened as you insert a set of fixes in groups, you will put four or five, maybe sometimes six or seven fixes into a process and group it together, run it through and you will expect an improvement rate occasionally as you go through that. The fixes don't deliver all of the improvements [stock], we had one of those.
Why do I have confidence? Because, we have got back now and added additional fixes, gotten back onto that curve, so we have confidence that the problem is fixed, because we have actually data and defects and so that gives us the confidence that we are to keep moving forward now and that happens sometimes in these development phases like this, so that's why we are going to over it a quarter.
Member of Broadwell and Haswell are incompatible for the unit for the most part these will slide into existing systems and it delivers the next generation of the low-power Broadwell. Why? Which is you give even more capability for fanless core products, so we and our OEM partners have a strong desire to get Broadwell to the market, so if I could there would be nothing slowing down. This is a small blip in schedule and we will continue on from here.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
Perfect. That's helpful, Brian. As my follow-up, Stacy, the last couple of quarters relative to the gross margin bridge or puts and takes you have kind of given ASP as a potential allowance on the downside and I guess I didn't see that in Q4, which it kind of confuses me a little bit given that that's the Bay Trail quarter ramp and so - or are you just getting more confidence as you are mixing lower that that ASP is not a factor in gross margin and how should I think about that.
Stacy Smith
Well, I think it goes back to the question I asked earlier, so as we are successful with Bay Trail, it will cause the average ASP to come down in the client group but keep in mind, we are forecasting a very robust growth rate in the data center. So you have the highest end of the Intel product family growing significantly faster than the rest.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
Okay, thank you.
Stacy Smith
By the way, I think it is also notable in Q3. Our AFP was up a measure. There was about 0.5 point of gross margin good news which was better than I expected.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Romit Shah of Nomura. Your line is open.
Romit Shah - Nomura
Great, thank you. On DCG, you guys have been talking about double digit annual growth target for the year. and just based on my math, you would need to grow data center plus 20% in the fourth quarter to get there. So could you talk a little bit about near-term momentum? Then as a follow-up, I just wanted to ask about the Federal shut down. It seems like its dragging on. I am wondering if you are seeing any impact here, broader enterprise business?
Stacy Smith
This is Stacy. I will take those and Brian can editorialize on our elective representatives. On the data center, don't pin me down to exactly 10% growth but we are going to be within spitting distance of that for the year. That does imply a growth rate that's significantly accelerated from the 12% that we had in Q3 and that's what I expect and that's what Brian expects and GM of that business. Generally what we are seeing, and Brian talked about the really robust growth rates we are seeing in the cloud, high-performance computing, storage and we have seen a resumption of some growth rate in the enterprise which has been the headwind that we have been facing in that business.
To your question on the debt deal and debate, I would say, we have not seen any impacts in our business. I think generally the financial markets have been pretty tame in their reaction to this. It is, in U.S. is going to make good on its debt applications.
Brian Krzanich
I am not going to comment any further on that one.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung of Citi. Your line is open.
Glen Yeung - Citi
Brian, I probably heard this one but just wanted to clarify. You made a reference earlier to MacOS. Were you suggesting that you would see Bay Trail devices in the MacOS?
Brian Krzanich
No, I said that we would have products across the board. It's Haswell.
Glen Yeung - Citi
Okay, very good. Just wanted to clarify.
Brian Krzanich
That was a group thing. I think that comment was around Bay Trail and Haswell and all OS forms.
Glen Yeung - Citi
Okay, glad we clarified that then. As a follow-up, I did want a little more color, if you would on what you are seeing in enterprise? It's just did what I have been seeing in the quarter as well but what I don't understand and hopefully you may have more color on it. Is the fact that as enterprise suggest they are back at maybe a more sustainable trend than we would otherwise see? And do you see any underlying reasons to why enterprise is maybe getting there?
Brian Krzanich
Well, so you are talking about the classic enterprise? I think this is a case where the restuff until recent times, especially in the U.S. as companies became more comfortable with what the spending horizon was going to be and what their projections for the rest of the year were, they started to unleash IT budgets and so we started to see an uptick in that, especially Western Europe and the U.S. started to grow again slightly. Do we think it will be continually at least through the fourth quarter? We are not making any projections yet for 2014. We will talk about those at our investor meeting. But you can imagine that given where we are with cloud and networking and storage and the enterprise, we are seeing the same kind of projections.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Roland of FBR. Your line is open.
Christopher Roland - FBR
Guys, thanks for the question. I thought maybe you guys could give us a little more granularity into what's going on with the other IA operating loss. Do we think that this is about as large as it gets as Bay Trail ramps? How do we think about that on an ongoing basis? Is this a good run rate, or how do you guys sort of forecast that going forward?
Stacy Smith
I think, I can [anecdotally] say for right now it is not a good run rate. We don't enter businesses to lose money, so our intent is to improve it. I think it's probably worthwhile to talk about what's happening year-over-year, quarter-on-quarter, probably year-over-year is the more illustrative portion of that.
What you see going on in other IA is, first and foremost the embedded or the Intelligent Systems Group had a very good quarter, record revenues, robust growth rate, very profitable, offsetting that is really three things that impact the operating profit. First, netbooks are coming to the end of their life as category. We are down to some single-digit millions of revenue from netbooks. A year ago, that was pretty robust and those were pretty profitable products.
A year ago, if you recall, we were talking about a buying pattern from one particular customer in modem space that didn't repeat this year, so you get a little bit of a year-on-year comp and then the other impact is this is a place where we have been making significant investments. The things that we have been talking about here of having products SoCs that span across price points, across operating systems. Those are places where we are making investments. We believe that investment is really important to the future of the company and we believe that investment gives us a differentiated competitive advantage out in time and lets us bring the best products to the market out in time.
Christopher Roland - FBR
Okay. Great. Thank you for that. Also on the Broadwell quarter push out, do we make up for that at some point in the future, or would this also push Skylake?
Brian Krzanich
We do not think it will push Skylake, so this is just - and in fact will even make up in total volume within a quarter or two after the one quarter push, so we tend to make these up very quickly. The two are independent. The early learning that's going on during the process development has no impact on Skylake's ability to come to market.

Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy of Stifel, Nicolaus & Company. Your line is open.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company
Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted few more details on the data center some of the moving parts. Stacy, you said that you expected unit growth to accelerate fourth quarter. Would that be because of the Avoton, or do you expect the ASPs to go up also. Is that the mix shift going to higher performance servers?
Stacy Smith
Before you give an [inch], I think I am not going to get more granular than I got. I would expect that unit growth accelerates from what we saw in Q3 and revenue growth accelerates from the 12% year-over-year growth we saw in Q3. Can I get more granular than that?
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company
Okay. Maybe if you could just tell us about the third quarter with ASPs up 2%, was that mostly driven by the introduction of E5 or is it an overall shift towards higher performance computing?
Stacy Smith
Yes. I would say it was probably more tied to the fact that the Enterprise segment went from decline to some single-digit growth and that is tied to the E5. It's a combination of those two things, but the enterprise tends to buy pretty rich mix of MP that's why it's such an important segment for us and so single-digit growth there is pretty helpful.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Your line is open.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO
Thank you very much. My first question is on the guidance, Brian, and you told us that your guidance is based on what you are seeing, the order patterns that you are seeing. Just wanted a little bit more color as to in terms of form factors from your OEM customers as well as from you. There seems to be more out there, so in your opinion, what is it? Is it not the right form factor from OEMs, which is causing - we wanted to understand the macro is pretty anemic, but in the contest of new products that are coming on, it has to be disappointing for you to see the order pattern, so what is in your opinion that's causing that and I had a quick follow-up after that please.
Brian Krzanich
I am not sure I can fully understand your question. If you question is around the number and variety of form factors, we are actually pretty excited about the rate of innovation we are seeing in 2-in-1s, in convertibles, in OS forms, Android, chromebooks and Win8, 8.1. So we have been pretty enthusiastic about what we are seeing. In fact we have been meeting with most of our customers and OEMs and looking at their Q1 lineup with them and I have been astonished by the amount of innovation and creative designs that are coming.
I think when you talk about just the market in general how we see it, we are trying to bring innovation to the PC but we are also trying to move into these markets that are growing already like tablets and phones. So our view is that at the end of the day, the customers are going to choose their form factors.
Tablets are absolutely here to stay and we plan to participate in those and that's why you see us in tablets from $99 to $350. Our job is try and innovate and actually drive capabilities into the tablet space that nobody else could deliver and bring that valuation and drive up in those markets.
Across PCs, we believe that as 2-in-1s, especially Haswell based 2-in-1s with all-day battery come to life, we are already seeing some signs of tablet market share win back as these 2-in-1 devices, especially in enterprise and the business side hit the market and people see the value of having both devices. The best of both devices, a tablet and a PC, all-in-one.
So we believe that as we go through the fourth quarter and we get more of these devices out there, we will see how this plays out over time now.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO
Okay, that's helpful. Then on the pricing front. Stacy, you highlighted, yes, pricing could be lower on the mix but then cost is lower for Bay Trail. But I am just looking at the dichotomy in desktop and notebook and maybe there is a very simple explanation. Desktop volume is down year-over-year, ASP is up, notebook is the reverse on the ASP front, their ASP is down year-over-year but volume is down as well. So could you just help me understand why the difference in the two trends? Thank you.
Stacy Smith
Well, I think what we are seeing is, we have seen notebook pricing coming down over time as that becomes a broader and broader market. So I think its as simple as that. I think the desktop piece is really interesting. What we are seeing in the desktop, again I am kind of zooming out and taking a two-year view. You have seen a segment that's been relatively slow growth
I think of it as a single-digit percent growth but a lot of segmentation happening within the category. So it has gone from the desktop business being primarily these beige boxes to all-in-ones and detachable all-in-ones and pretty high-performance devices that are doing gaming as well as these very cost-effective machines for first-time buyers in emerging markets. So you are seeing this hyper segmentation as a category and more stability in the pricing as a result because we have these different segments.
I think we are on the verge of seeing that kind of segmentation play out now in the notebook segment with what we are seeing with 2-in-1s and ultrabooks and detachables and convertibles. So it will be interesting to watch that play out.
Mark Henninger
Operator, please go ahead and introduce the next question.

Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri of Cowen and Company. Your line is open.
Timothy Arcuri - Cowen and Company
Thank you. First question is on CapEx. Stacy, is the cut due mostly to 450. You had said before that there was no push out in the timing but some of the companies selling equipment are saying that there has been some push outs. So I am just wondering where that cut is coming from? Thanks.
Stacy Smith
You are talking about the $200 million. No, there is actually no cut in there. We are just refining our forecast as we get down to one quarter left in the year.
Timothy Arcuri - Cowen and Company
Got it, great. So just to be specific on the timing on 450, nothing has changed there?
Brian Krzanich
So let me answer that one. We have not changed our timing. We are still targeting the second, latter half of this decade. We continue to see great value in 450. It brings tremendous economic value to everybody who participates in it. We continue to work with our partners. We are here part of the joint development program in New York, continuing to work on 450. We continue to work with our partners, especially TSMC and Samsung and we are still targeting the back half of this decade. This is a long 10-year program when you really take a look at it. So I think you will get mixed signals throughout those 10 years, take a look at the long-term trend and then really start to understand the economic value here and you will see we will get there in the end.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of David Wong of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
David Wong - Wells Fargo
Thanks very much. Bay Trail. If I'm not mistaken there are Android tablets using Clover Trail+ the currently available, when might we expect Android tablets using Bay Trail in the market?
Brian Krzanich
You are absolutely right there, several tablets out there currently today with Clover Trail+ using Android. What I told you was, there are about 50 designs on Bay Trail, about 20 of those are 2-in-1s, probably 25, 20 of them are Bay Trail tablets on Android, there is going to be about eight systems on shelf, eight to 10 systems on shelf, we believe, by the say Black Friday timeframe. Most of those will be Android tablets.
David Wong - Wells Fargo
Okay. Great. Could you -knocking on what proportion of your core family sales will be Haswell in the December quarter and are you seeing Haswell, why being extensively adopted in tablets or is it primarily the regular Haswell that goes into tablets in 2-in-1s?
Stacy Smith
Yes. We don't give to that level of granularity to break out our sales by product family. I think, Brian gave you some good insight into the number of systems that we see coming to the market, a lot of which will be there before Black Friday and then even more of that kind of build out over the course of Q1. I'll let Brian answer the Haswell-Y.
Brian Krzanich
You asked Haswell-Y versus [Haswell]. First, most of the tablets we are building with OEM partners are Bay Trail or as you said Clover Trail+ based. There are some that are being based on core; most of those are being based on the standard core product. Haswell-Ys are going into the fanless systems or extremely low powered 2-in-1s.
Mark Henninger
Operator, we would like to go ahead and take two more questions, please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Covello, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs
Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. Stacy, something you had alluded to in your presentation at the Developer Forum. I wonder where you think die sizes are headed on average for the company given some of the moves into these different markets that you talked about.
Stacy Smith
Again, it's going to be similar to the ASP question. When you are talking average die size, it's really going to be a function of mix, so it becomes hard to answer. I think when you look at it by segment, we are improving our cost structure in each of the segments of the business. The die size is going to get better and the core family, it's going to get better and Bay Trail. It's going to get better in the tablet segment of the business, but the mix will really dictate the average. I don't know Brian, if you want to add anything to that.
Brian Krzanich
Yes. I would agree with Stacy. Each of one of the families of the products we have roadmaps even with integration, but because of Moore's Law we are able to continually drive down the die size. It's going to be mix dependent, we think if you look at the average mix, it will be down slightly, but it's not a dramatic drop at least. Again, it will be mix-driven.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs
Okay. That's helpful. Then if I could ask for my follow-up, in terms of the mobile market, the handset market in particular, how important do you think connectivity in the other surrounding pieces around the processor are for Intel to be successful in this market? How do you feel you are positioned in those complementary pieces around the processor?
Brian Krzanich
Sure. The connectivity and comps both are very important. We had Wi-Fi for 12-plus years, so our position in Wi-Fi is good. We have made acquisitions in GPS and GNSS lately to add to our portfolio. We talked about in the prepared statements about our progress on LTE and we actually believe we are making great progress in LTE.
We added LTE data now, LTE data and voice by the end of the year, LTE with carrier aggregation first half of next year. That's very good progress in our mind on LTE. I want to remind you though, but it's really when you take a look at these SoC products, it's about all of the IPs.
So you have got to get the graphics right. You have got to get the connectivity right. You have got to get the comps right. We really have a drive to both our individual IPs correctly there and then to integrate them into the silicon. That's kind of the order that you have to do with it. You have to go get the IP correct. That's why you see our LTE products are standalone now. Then you integrate them in once you get the capability in a standalone product. We will be working on that next year.
Mark Henninger
Operator, please go ahead and introduce our last question.
Operator
Our final question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from BoA/Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Vivek Arya - BoA/Merrill Lynch
Thanks for taking my question. Brian, my first question is, within DCG can you help us quantify traditional enterprise versus some of the growth categories in cloud storage and networking? And where I am going with that is, when does this latter growth part start dominating and what are the implications on ASP when that happens?
Brian Krzanich
I have never done a calculation on when they would overtake enterprise. If you take a look at it, we said that cloud, storage, networking, we are growing plus 20%. But I would have to go back and take a look. We can have that discussion maybe at the Investor Meeting on how those percentages of the business change over time.
Stacy Smith
Vivek, if you go back and look at last year's Investor Meeting, you will see something presented by Diane that actually very explicitly breaks out the size of the different segments and the growth rate and what you will see there is enterprise is 40%, 50% of the overall enterprise segment. These other segments in aggregate are overtaking it, kind of as we speak and growing really fast. We will talk a lot more about that in a month.
Vivek Arya - BoA/Merrill Lynch
Got it, and then as my follow-up. I wanted to just get a sense for how much of a leapfrog advantage will 14 nanometer provide in the mobile market because recently we saw very impressive benchmarks from Apple on their A7 SoC. I understand that they optimized a lot of things within their system that other customers may not be able to do but they were able to show very impressive benchmarks on 28 nanometer silicon. I am wondering as you think about your 14 nanometer products and the fact that you will really need to leapfrog to get major share in mobile how should we think about how big those advantages will be, like what the discussion with customer have been so far?
Brian Krzanich
Sure. So, let's make sure, I mean you just kind of used the generic word of benchmarks and there are lot of different ones that are out there. So I am not sure exactly which ones you are talking about. But if you just take a look at our products and all of our products are 64-bit. So we have had that for an extended period of time and products that we are shipping today are already 64-bit. If you take a look at things like transistor density and you compare, pardon the pun, apples-to-apples and you compare, say, the A7 to our Bay Trail, which is the high density 22 nanometer technology then our transistor density is higher or more dense than the A7 is. So it's a good product. I am not in any way trying to deface that, but we do see the Moore's Law advantage from 28 to 22 nanometer as an example, when you compare dense technologies to dense technologies.
We believe 14 nanometer it just an another extension of Moore's Law. So it will have that same roughly twice density that you will see between 28 and 22 nanometer. You will see that same kind of increase or improvements as you move to 14. It is a true 14 nanometer technology. Did I answer your question?
Vivek Arya - BoA/Merrill Lynch
Yes. So Brian, maybe what I was trying to get to was, as you look at the kind of Android customers or Chrome customers that you might engage with 14 nanometer. How is that changing from the engagement that you have with Bay Trail? Basically the question is, is the level of engagement accelerating as they look at your 14 nanometer progress?
Brian Krzanich
So, yes. From that perspective, they see a roadmap now. I think more importantly than just 14 nanometer. What they see is a roadmap from us around the Atom SoC. They see Bay Trail as a great first step and great product. You have seen some of the performance benchmarks out there. We just talked about the transistor density. Stacy has talked about our cost and ability to hit these lower prices points. It has got good graphics performance. As I said we are able to provide a 64-bit solution across all OS options as well.
So they look at that and then they look at our roadmap, and say okay, they have got LTE, they have got connectivity, they have got a standalone, they have plans to integrate those technologies in, in a basic SoC. They are starting to build confidence in our roadmap along with us. That's, I think, what they really look at this as they see our Atom roadmap that's highly competitive.
Vivek Arya - BoA/Merrill Lynch

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2013 Intel Corporation Earnings Conference Call. My name is Jamie, and I’ll be your coordinator for today. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.
I’d now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today’s call Mr. Mark Henninger, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed sir.
Mark Henninger
Great, thank you Jaime and welcome everyone to Intel’s second quarter 2013 earnings conference call. By now you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with that. If you’ve not received both documents, they’re available currently at our investor website, intc.com.
I’m joined today by Brian M. Krzanich, our CEO; and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we’ll hear brief remarks from both of them followed by Q&A.
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today’s discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Also, if during this call we use any non-GAAP financial measures or references, we’ll post the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliations to our website, intc.com.
Lastly, I’d like to highlight a change we’ll be making to our earnings release process starting with the third quarter earnings announcement on October 15, 2013. To ensure the timely and controlled release of information, we plan to make our results available on our IR website intc.com about a minute after the market close and no longer distribute quarterly financial results through a newswire service.
With that, let me hand the call back over to Brian.
Brian M. Krzanich
Thanks, Mark. It’s great to have a chance to speak to you all on my first earnings call as CEO. The last two months have been exciting for me. I’ve spent the majority of my time meeting with customers, employees, and my executive team. I have heard a wide variety of views about our industry and Intel, how we’re positioned, where we’re strong and where we can improve. I have the opportunity to share my vision and strategy for our Company and lay out my expectation as we move into the new era with an updated set of priorities.
Those conversations lead me more enthusiastic and more confident than ever about our opportunity as a Company. Intel has unmatched assets in process technology and architecture. A powerful brand and talented employees that are producing some remarkable results.
Let me give you a few highlights from the second quarter. There were several significant milestones in mobility. First, we unveil details about our next generation atom architecture, code named Silvermont. The Silvermont architecture will deliver up to 5x reduction in power at the same level performance or up to a 3x improvement in performance over our prior generation of architecture.
Silvermont is unique and its ability to span the market’s appetite for computing. From ultra-mobile devices to the datacenter. And it supports both windows and android. The Silvermont platform were underpinned – are underpinned our products for tablets, two in ones and desktops, as well as our phones and microserver products for the datacenter. The products will be Bay Trail, Merrifield and Avonton respectively.
Then at Computex, we launched the Haswell family of processors, which delivered the biggest improvement in battery life in Intel’s history, making no comprises, high performance, two-in-one devices that make – that all day battery life a reality. Haswell along with Bay Trail will power more than 50 different two-in-one devices in the pipeline, including the very first fanless Core design.
During the same week at Computex, we also announced the landmark tablet design in the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. The Galaxy Tab 3 will use an atom SoC and our LTE solution, signaling important progress in the tablet space. The datacenter strategy is continuing to pay dividends.
Our cloud storage – cloud and storage business each grew their revenue more than 40% year-over-year. Networking grew more than 20% and high performance computing business were 98% of all new systems entering the top 500 list. In fact, the number one system on the top 500 was all Intel for the first time since 1997, using a combination of Intel Xeon CPU’s and Xeon Phi accelerator.
And finally our investments and expertise in process technology continue to be the foundation of our industry leadership. With 22 nanometer defect density and throughput times at record low levels and 14 nanometer on-track to enter production by the end of the year. Together, these accomplishments highlight to me what’s possible when we focus our resources on the right objectives and we hold ourselves accountable for results.
At the same time, I understand that we’ve not always lived up to the standard that we have set for ourselves. Intel was slow to respond to the ultra-mobile PC trend. The importance of that can be seen in the current market dynamics. The traditional PC market segment is down from our expectations at the beginning of the year while ultra-mobile devices like tablets are up.
Even more important, there were always be another next big thing. It’s our job to continue to scan for emerging trends, unlocking, participating in, and shaping these nascent markets. Doing that will require some changes at Intel, which we have begun.
Just a few weeks ago, I announced a significant reorganization. The changes we’ve made flatten the organization, improved decision making and will contribute to a culture of even greater accountability. These elements are critical in the fast paced ultra-mobile environment.
In addition to the organizational changes, we have made several strategy and priority changes that will allow us to focus and win in that environment. These changes will drive a greater emphasis on Atom-based products bringing the full weight of our process and architectural leadership to the Atom family.
We will move Atom even faster to our leading-edge silicon technology and focus on the SOC integration of key components like graphics, communications and other devices. This does not mean we will lessen the value or leadership of our Core product family, but rather make Atom an equal player in technology leadership for the ultra-mobile space. Both product lines will be driving Intel's future.
Some of the changes we're making are subtle and some are more transformational. In general, you're likely to see us making moves and adjustments in the market before you hear us talking about them. But we'll of course have a substantive update for you at the investor meeting in November.
What I can say now is that all of the changes are focused on value creation. Our company has a strong record of cash flow generation and returning that cash to our owners. I recognize that we are the stewards of our owners' capital and that tradition will continue. I'm excited about what lies ahead.
Intel is a company with extraordinary assets at its disposal and I'm looking forward to making the most of those assets in an environment where the pace of innovation and market trends force transformation is faster than it's ever been.
With that, let me turn it over to Stacy.
Stacy J. Smith
Thanks, Brian. I'd like to take a few minutes to walk through our second quarter financials and our expectations as we head into the back half of the year. Then we can get right into Q&A.
The second quarter results came in as expected. Second quarter revenue came in at $12.8 billion, up 2% from the first quarter. The Core business came in as expected but we saw some softness in our baseband business. At a segment level, the PC group grew 1% sequentially and the data center group grew 6%.
As expected inventory levels across the worldwide PC supply chain grew slightly as customers began building Haswell based PCs, but inventory levels are still being managed well below historical averages based on uncertainty heading into the back half of the year.
For the third quarter of 2013, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $13.5 billion, up 5% from the second quarter which is at the lower end of the historical range as a result of our expectation that our customers will continue to operate with lean inventory levels exiting the third quarter.
Moving to gross margin, second quarter gross margin of 58% was in line with our guidance and up 2 points from the first quarter as a result of the qualification for sale of additional Haswell products and higher volume. As expected, the reduction in excess capacity charges in the second quarter was offset by an increase in 14 nanometer start-up costs.
For the third quarter, we expect gross margin to increase 3 points to 61% as we qualify our Bay Trail product line for sale, increase our volume, and start to see factory start-up costs come down.
For the second quarter, spending was in line with expectations at $4.7 billion. For the third quarter, we're forecasting an increase to total spending of $100 million. The reclassification spending on process engineers from across the sales to R&D increases our spending but we expect this will be mostly offset by spending reductions across the company. These spending reductions allow us to reduce our spending forecast for the year to $18.7 billion.
Operating income for the second quarter was $2.7 billion with earnings per share of $0.39. Taking a look at the balance sheet, total cash investments ended the quarter at $17.4 billion, up slightly from the first quarter. In the second quarter, we generated approximately $5 billion in cash from operations, paid approximately $1 billion in dividends, purchased almost $3 billion in capital assets and repurchased over $0.5 billion in stock.
While our first half financials played out as expected, the overall PC market segment for 2013 is expected to be weaker than we forecast at the beginning of the year. Our expectation is now that revenue will be approximately flat to last year. As a result, our gross margin forecast for the year is now 59% versus the prior forecast of 60%. Additionally, we have reduced our forecast for capital spending by $1 billion to $11 billion.
We have an unprecedented lineup of products coming to market in the second half of this year across all the segments of our business. Haswell delivers a historical increase in battery life across a diverse line up of ultra-mobile form factors like 2-in-1 convertibles, tablets and other touch-enabled devices. In the second half, we will launch Bay Trail which will further extend our product line across screen sizes and price points in both tablets and PCs.
In our phone business, we are on track to ship multimode data and voice LTE baseline solutions as well as our next generation applications processor codename Merrifield by the end of the year. In the data center, we have new microserver and Xeon [class] products coming to market in the second half.
This leadership product portfolio is built on an extending manufacturing lead which gives us the world's highest performing, lowest cost and lowest power transistors. Building on its leadership further, we are on track to start production on our 14 nanometer process technology in the back half of this year.
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.

(Operator instructions). The first question comes from Glen Yeung from Citigroup.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
Thanks for letting me ask a question. The first one is on the second half of the year and your outlook there. If I look at your guidance for the year and your guidance for Q3, the implication is 7% sequential growth in revenues for the fourth quarter and I wonder – that's obviously high relative to historical norms, kind of like numbers we saw back in the early part of the last decade and I wonder what gives you the confidence there? Is there something about the mix – obviously new products but is there also something about the mix maybe between data center and client?
Stacy J. Smith
Hi, Glen. This is Stacy. I would characterize – I guess I'd say it's a little early to get that specific about Q4. At this point, I'd expect seasonal which is a little less than what you said but still got this into that kind of flat year-on-year revenue growth. And I think the tail for us will really be written in the back half of Q3 when we start to see how our customers are putting in place inventory in anticipation of that fourth quarter selling season. And right now our view on that is just fairly cautious. We expect that they'll continue to run lean inventory levels but the reality is we won't know that until we get into late August, early September. That's when you normally start to see them putting in the supply line that also aligns with other things in the industry and so we think that's when we're likely to really get a sense of Q3 and the momentum into Q4.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
All right, makes sense. Okay. And the next question is for Brian. First of all, Brian, congratulations on your new role. The question is now that you're in that role for a couple of months and as you say you talk to customers. Today, Intel has very good products in mobile and tomorrow we'll have arguably the best products in mobile even [they do today]. But I wonder in your discussions with customers if you think that that's enough? If the customer base is now open to accepting an x86 based processor in what has traditionally been an arm market or does it matter?
Brian M. Krzanich
Okay. As Mark said, it was a little hard to hear you on our side. We're having some network issues but let me try to answer your question. The question is can x86 go into these ultra-mobile markets and how do the customers view that? And my answer would be they are more than willing to accept it. The fact that x86 works on both Android and Windows is a real advantage to our OEM base. They look at that and say that they can have one architectural design, one set of products and use both operating systems. So it's a unique feature that we are able to provide. It's more been in focus by Intel of actually going in and designing for those markets and moving our products in there. You really see that with Haswell and Bay Trail. Haswell on the Core side and Bay Trail on the Atom side really being designed for those ultra-mobile products. We talked about Haswell producing the first stainless Core products out there in the market in any kind of real volume. And then Bay Trail really being designed for the much lower price points that you see these tablets and even down to the entry level of tablets. And so the fact that it’s x86 is an advantage actually because we’ve been able to produce both Android and Windows on our product now.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
Great. Thanks so much.

The next question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thanks for taking my question. Brian, first of all how should we think about ASP trend in the PC segment; I think you outlined 3% sequential declines in Q2 and you got into another 50 point gross margin head from lower ASPs in Q3, why are you not seeing more of an uplift from the rollout of Haswell?
Stacy J. Smith
Yeah, this is Stacy; I’ll take that one, because it was in the CFO commentary that I put out. You should think of it as mix shift for us and share win at the low end of the market. I think if you look at our first half results you’ll see we came in pretty much in line with what we thought, but during a time where the [TAM] was somewhat weaker than we thought. I think the offset there, the plug is that we gained some share at the low end and so we have bit more mix at the lower end and then due to share win in that particular segment of the market.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thanks, Stacy. And as a follow-up, why are we not seeing more benefits from the decrease in 14 nanometer startup cost, like when I look at the uplift we should expect this time they’re not as much as uplift we have seen in prior cycles then when the startup costs have decreased and I think your guidance implies a sequential gross margin decline in Q4. If you could just walk us through the puts and takes, I would appreciate that.
Stacy J. Smith
Yeah. I’m sorry we’re having networking problems, so let me just make sure I got your question. If you’re asking simplifying what are we seeing in terms of the startup cost trend relative to prior and what are the puts and take for Q4, is that what your question is?
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Yeah, relative to gross margins that’s right.
Stacy J. Smith
Relative to gross margin shift. So the startup cost trend is directionally the same as what we’ve seen in other generations, it will be the same shape. Generally the same impact on gross margins, so you’ll see the peak in startup cost in the second quarter will come down some in Q3 and then we’ll get a bigger benefit in Q4 and then they’ll come down a bit more in the first half of next year, so it's a comparable trend. In the fourth quarter the puts and takes we’d just do the gross margin progression across the year we were at 56% in Q1. We hit our forecast in Q2 at 58%. We’re expecting few points of increase in the third quarter to 61%. And then as, if I think about Q4 I think we have a couple of tailwinds, so I’d expect the volume to be up some. We should get some good news associated with startup cost, and then the offset in Q4 is going to be, we should be well into the build of broad well. So during the build on the prequalification material, so my sense is we’ll have an increase in inventory write-offs in the fourth quarter and that’ll offset some of those good news. Net of all that I expect gross margin in the fourth quarter to be at or maybe a little bit higher than where we're in Q3 and that forecasts in another 90 days. So we don’t get lost in code names. That product is our lead product on 14 nanometer, so that kind of aligned with being in manufacturing in the back half of the year on 14 nanometer.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay, thank you.
Stacy J. Smith

The next question comes from Christopher Danely from JP Morgan.
Christopher Danely - JP Morgan
Thanks, guys. Brian, you said in the press release in the scale upfront the year you’re taking in a wide variety of views from customers and people of the company and stuff like that. Could you just give us your opinion on what has surprised you and maybe how your view has changed and what you think has been important out there?
Brian M. Krzanich
Sure. So, I don’t know if anything really surprised me. I think the things that were positive for me is that, our customers especially if they want Intel to get into this expanding ultra level market, they’re looking for Intel to be stronger and have a better and more capable product light up in there, and they’re excited about the products that we have coming, the Haswell and Bay Trail. So I’d say the key message that they’ve been giving us is, we really want you there, we see the products coming, we want even more and we want a faster line up following those. And so that you hear or you heard in my speech today and in the earnings release that we’re really putting much, much stronger effort on Atom and driving our SSE integration and pulling it forward to the leading edge. So, I’d say that was the major point or major comments I got back from our customer base.
Christopher Danely - JP Morgan
Okay, thanks. And then as my follow-up so you guys are guiding for some decent growth here in the second half of this year. If we go back to last year you were essentially flat in the second half. So can you just give us your sense of why, what's driving the confidence that things are going to be better for you guys in the second half of this year versus the second half of last year?
Stacy J. Smith
Yeah, I’d say it's a couple of things. And I’d also say what we’re guiding for Q3 is sub-seasonal growth, so it's off of an okay Q2 but not a game buster Q2. So I don’t think it's a wildly optimistic forecast. In terms of the tailwinds that I see first and foremost is the product cycle. Haswell is a great product for ultrabooks in two end runs and as Brian said with Bay Trail coming to the marketplace we’re going to be hitting price points in the touch enabled segment of the PC market that we’ve never touched before and we’ll be able to do that profitably, and we’ll start hitting share in tablets. We’ve got kind of our first big tablet wins out in the market place and with Bay Trail we think again we enable other designs to come to market at price points that are going to be I think nicer in consumer price points. The second tailwind that I’d say is we expect generally in improving macroeconomic climate as we go into the back half. I think that’s aligned with most economists in the first half the U.S. was a little bit stronger than we have thought starting the year. China was a little bit weaker but generally I’d expect the improving macroeconomic environment in the back half.
Christopher Danely - JP Morgan
Thank you.

The next question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
Good afternoon guys, thanks for letting me ask the question. Brian, although early the initial read we’re getting on Bay Trail with your partners is pretty positive, and I think that’s driving a concern in the investment community with whether or not Bay Trail is going to be so good that it starts to cannibalize Haswell, and so I guess I’d like to get your thoughts on how you can segment the market properly, to what extent do you think you’re a slave to market forces and to what extent do you think you can bring applications that are MIPS attentive into the ecosystem and secure the Core business even as you try to get more aggressive in Bay Trail and Atom?
Brian M. Krzanich
Sure. So, first let me say our view right now on Bay Trail is that we don’t believe it will be cannibalistic in that nature. We believe what it really does it allows us to get into these markets that we’re not in, in a big way today. And that as Stacy said are these sub $400, sub $300 in some case, clamshells and touch enabled convertibles in two in one devices, and tablets $199 and below some you’re going to see even lower below $150 and much below that as we go through the holiday season. So Bay Trail really first and foremost we believe gives solid performance, solid battery life relative to the competition in price points and markets that were simply not in, in a big way today. So we look at it mostly as an expensive. The other thing that I’d think as a point is Haswell as we said is the largest battery life improvement in Intel’s history along with great performance and its providing products that has core level of performance that will be fan less for the first time. So we still believe that there is a strong drive for performance in segments of this market that look for high-definition video performance, gaming. All of the things that if you actually look at a lot of the tablet usage even, people are doing more and more and definitely in these two in one and convertible devices people look for that kind of application. So we believe that Haswell allowing us to go down into those better price points and lower powers will give us the performance option to keep people up into those regions.
Stacy J. Smith
If I can just add a couple of data points on that in terms of what we've seen over the last few years. First off is to reinforce what Brian said. There still is a big gap in terms of performance and features between the best in Bay Trail and the Core i3, i5 or i7 segment of our product line. And if you look at the last three years even in a time where the market's been relatively weak, the Core i5, i7 volumes have been very healthy and if anything we've seen a larger mix overall to Core over that time period. So there still is a healthy segmentation in the marketplace where Bay Trail will play – it will start to expand this into markets where we don't play today. And because of the cost structure we think we can do it with more dollars per unit than we would be able to do if we were going after that segment today with Celeron or even with some of the low end of the Pentium roadmap. So it's a powerful product from that perspective, John.
Brian M. Krzanich
At the end of the day, the market will go where the market goes and better to have a product like Bay Trail that we can play no matter where it goes rather than miss that market which if you look over the past was more than it is.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
Helpful guys. And then just my follow-on Stacy. Several years back, you put out a long-term gross margin target of sort of 55% to 65% and I think for most of the time since you've put that target out, you've been operating near the higher end of that range. I'm just kind of curious as you start bringing Bay Trail, Merrifield, put a renewed effort into the Atom space, should we think that the next three years that that range is going to be more directed towards the lower half or are there other puts and takes within that gross margin range?
Stacy J. Smith
As you probably anticipate I'm not going to get pinned down inside the range. I'm still very comfortable with the 55% to 65%. I think the second half is a great proof point. We're going to be – from Q1 to Q3 we're going to quadruple our tablet volume. We're running a 61% gross margin at the company level. As Brian said, the market's going to go where it's going to go. We've got some great products to give us a cost structure to go after them profitably and I'm still confident on that gross margin range and we'll talk more about the specific segments when we get to the investor meeting.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
Thanks guys, appreciate it.

The next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Sanford Bernstein.
Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. First on the annual revenue guidance. Your prior guidance had total revenues up in the low single digits as well as total units up in the low single digits. With the new guidance of relatively flat revenue, does that essentially imply flat total units? And if so, how important is the Bay Trail launch and Bay Trail volumes to actually achieving that type of a unit target?
Stacy J. Smith
Apology, Stacy, let me restate your question to make sure I'm answering because that was a little garbled in the middle and it's not your fault. We're just having some issues on our part. I think what you're asking me is kind of defend my flat revenue forecast and give you a sense of what's going on in client versus other segments of the business and in particular what's going on with units? Is that where you were going?
Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein
Yeah, that's it. And if the guidance does actually imply flat units correlated with your revenue, how important is gaining Bay Trail volume in the back half to achieving that type of a unit outlook?
Stacy J. Smith
Yeah, okay. Let me go there. So first I'd say we would actually expect that overall computer units, so tablets up to PCs will be down from this year. And that's consistent with a flat revenue forecast for the company, so let me just kind of walk you through them and I'll just start with what you've seen from Gartner and IDC is their view of the year. We're pretty aligned with those numbers in terms of our view of the classic PC market. But to get to then our units you have to make some adjustments to that. So first off, in their class view of PCs that will not include some of the ultra-mobile devices, i.e. the Microsoft Surface Pro. So you'd add that in to get to our PC Client group units. We think we're gaining some share in tablets, so that's a little bit of an offset. Netbooks for us is declining pretty significantly. That's not in the PC Client groups segment. That's in the other IAG segment. And then as I said earlier in my prepared remarks, we think we're gaining some share so that also gives us a little bit of help. But when you net all that out, you'd say our units and our revenue for the PC Client group is down over year-over-year. It's just not down as much as the headline number that you see from Gartner. So you start there. And then the offset to that the places where we're growing is data center group which we think grows in the low double digits. If you do – manage your ramp on that it's 20% of our revenue. So that adds a couple of points of growth to the company. NAND is probably worth a point on its own is they look to be having a good year. Some other smaller things but you kind of net that out against the PC Client group that's down a bit and you get to flat for the year. So just kind of a rough map on viewing the different segments. Does that answer your question?
Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein
No, that's very helpful. And as my follow-up, if I could carve into the data center a little bit. So you are still – looks like it's still looking for low double digits growth in this business that seems to be unchanged from the last couple of quarters. Does that not imply a very significant ramp both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year? I mean in the ballpark of 15% to 20% sequentially as well as year-over-year in the second half. Can you give us some, I guess, where you're confidence comes from that you're going to get that kind of growth in the data center in the second half? Is it all macro or is it something else? What drives that?
Brian M. Krzanich
Sure. This is Brian. I'll answer that one. Yeah, so we're still confident in the second half growth of our data center business overall. As we mentioned, we're seeing strong growth in the cloud, the high performance computing, our networking and our storage. We think those continue through the second half of this year. What was down as Stacy mentioned was – the enterprise data centers were down a bit in the first half. We think as the macroeconomics continue to improve through this year that picks up a bit. When you put that all together, we believe that – absolutely our view is that we can continue through this year with that low double digit growth.
Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein
The enterprise had to have been down more than that, right? You said that the hard drive or storage and networking, all this other stuff was up 20% to 40%. I think your total data center business in the first half year-over-year is just flat to up a little bit. So that enterprise piece had to have been down quite a bit year-over-year in the second. So you're saying you're going to see a very significant reversal of that trend in the second half?
Stacy J. Smith
Yeah. And from a [wonky] finance standpoint, realize there's also kind of prior period comparisons been going on in the first half of last year. We were in the steep part of the ramp for Romley. In the second half of this year, we'll be launching other versions of Ivy versions of the data center. So the short answer to your question is yes, I would expect some pretty steep quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year comps in the back half of this year. That is what we're planning for.
Mark Henninger
And Stacy we're going to have to move on from there.
Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein

The next question comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Hi, guys. Can you hear me okay?
Brian M. Krzanich
We can. Thanks, Ross.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Great. First question is for Brian. That focus on the ultra-mobility side of things, can you talk a little bit about what that implies for the OpEx for Intel? The OpEx is elevated as a percentage of sales versus where it's been historically mainly on the R&D side. My understanding is the majority of that spending is for the mobile effort. Is your efforts to expedite that process likely to mean more OpEx to deliver those better results? And maybe a follow-on to that is when do we get either results on the top line happening or you rationalize some of that OpEx? Thank you.
Brian M. Krzanich
Sure. Let me start. The simple answer is no. We're not going to increase our OpEx spending and in fact, what we've really been focusing on is managing that as well. What you're going to see and remember, as we move our architecture more and more toward SOC, a lot of the work we do bridges between Core and Atom and as we pull Atom forward onto the leading-edge technology, again, that allows a lot of the architectural work to be in alignment and be shared amongst the two products. So, we believe that we can move faster on Atom and into this ultra-mobility space without having to change or increase our OpEx. So absolutely that's the current model that we're working under. From when will you start to see it? Some of these changes have been started a while back and you see Bay Trail coming out towards the end of this year. It's a product that is on that Atom/Core that is truly industry leading. We talked earlier about there are a lot of the benchmarks coming out showing it very strong against the competition if not leading the competition in many of the metrics. And so we believe that you’ll start to see some of this just naturally over the next six months as Bay Trail ramps up and gets into production, but we have a series of products after and you’ll see more and more acceleration. So don’t think of this as a onetime shift where you’ll see a digital move. Look at it as a constant pushing of the accelerator down and the thing just gets faster and faster as time goes by. And so you’ll just see more and more strength of that Atom line as time goes through here, and it will be kind of just, you’ll look back and say well it's obviously that the Atom line has truly become strong and they’ve got share in the tablet space.
Stacy J. Smith
If I could just add to that, maybe I can give you a little bit of sense of where we’re trying to go. You, I’m sure noticed we brought down the overall spending forecast for the Company. We know that we’re running hot in terms of spending as a percent of revenue. We’ve been very consciously making investments in that space. What I’ve seen in Brian in his tenure is he’s very focused on driving that efficiency and bringing it down. We’ll come down a few points between where we were in Q2 in the end of the year in terms of spending as a percent of revenue and the expectation is we can come down more next year.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Great, and I guess …
Brian M. Krzanich
Go ahead.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
No, go ahead.
Brian M. Krzanich
Well, my point was just going to be reemphasize what Stacy just said is that, my answer for why OpEx won't go up. If you just take a look at what we’ve done moving into Q3 right, and efficiency and structure that we put in both the reorganization that we did and flattening and decision making, and just the cost savings that we’ve already put in through efficiencies in both the OpEx and the CapEx that you saw. We expect that same level of efficiency to keep moving forward even as we make this transition. So to me those are not separated. Those go hand in hand actually as you become more efficient.
Stacy J. Smith
Thanks for you patience with the audio’s. Ross, do you have a follow up question?
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Yeah, I do. Switching gears again for BK but on the foundry side of things. I think Paul described that that you’re no longer crawling on the first quarter conference call. I know that’s a business that’s near and dear to your heart given your prior job. Can you give us some benchmarks that we should watch for to being the success or lack there of that Intel plans to have and in generally speaking can you explain how your strategy and foundry maybe any different than the prior CEO?
Brian M. Krzanich
Sure. You have to remember that even when you signup a foundry customer it's 18 to 24 or sometimes even longer 30 months before that foundry customer is able to start producing product, especially when they move from one foundry to another as they do go through their design cycle and their product qualification. So you should think that even the customers that we’ve already signed up that you’ve heard about in the press those revenues and that impact on Intel’s bottom line is still ways out, and any changes we’d make in strategy or additional customer we’d make now will have that same timeline. I think again, Paul said it right, you want to kind of crawl, walk, run not necessarily because that’s what we should do in order to manage it. It's more -- you really want to make sure that the systems and the customer support models that you have are in place to handle the volume that you’re really taking on, and since we haven't been a foundry business all our life we wanted to go and make sure we really knew what we were doing there. We are moving from I’d say that crawl space to at least the walk space. I think that the philosophy we have moving forward is that we’re going to treat every one of these customers that come to us and come talk to us about foundry opportunity individually and look at them from a strategic standpoint, what size of business they bring and whether their products can really take advantage of our process leadership. And so we don’t take or look at this as separating out the do -- we will’s or won't. We’re taking each customer individually and looking at them as an opportunity and what is the right thing for the shareholders from – bringing value to the shareholders with this technology that we have.

The next question comes from David Wong from Wells Fargo.
David Wong - Wells Fargo
Thanks very much. You mentioned moving Atom even faster to the leading edge. Can you give us some detail as to when we might see 14 nanometer atom products in the market and similarly you’ve talked about 14 nanometers going into production end of this year. So does that mean the first 14 nanometer Core products will launch in the first quarter of 2014?
Brian M. Krzanich
Okay. So, let me – you asked a couple of questions. We are not going to give changes to the roadmap or any kind of product schedules here, from what will happen as a result of the strategy. We will try and bring those updates to our Investor Meeting that happens in November. As far as our 14 nanometer Core launch in our – just our general product launch, I think what we’ve said so far is, first half of 2014 and we’re not going to – we’re not ready to give any specifics beyond that.
David Wong - Wells Fargo
Okay.
Stacy J. Smith
I gave you a pretty strong hint with the fact that it will be taking prequalification reserves, you can kind of sense that we’re well – those are going to be material. So we will be well into production on the fourth quarter.
David Wong - Wells Fargo
Excellent. Thanks, Stacy. And just one other, it’s the lower CapEx plans due to lower spending on 14 nanometer and 10 nanometer or lower on 450 millimeter or both?
Stacy J. Smith
It’s a variety of things David. As we said on the call, our view of the overall market is less now than it was when we started the year. I think you’ve seen us trying to be very responsive to changes in demand and get the balance right. And so as our view of the market change, we saw some opportunities for things that we thought we were going to put in place this year that we no longer have to put in place. And it’s across the board, it’s no one thing. Similar to what you saw in Q1, we’ve found opportunities to drive more re-use. Here we’re finding some opportunities to push some capital out of the year. Some of it is 450 not based on schedule changes, but it’s just based on some efficiencies that we’re able to find and shortening the time it takes us to install certain things and that kind of stuff. Some of it is M&E for 14 nanometer, some of it is space, just a variety of kind of small things that added up to a billion bucks.

Great guys. Thank you very much for taking the question. Just a follow-up on the CapEx. Does the new $11 billion forecast still include a full $2 billion for the new shell or is that some of what has gotten pushed out?
Stacy J. Smith

James Covello - Goldman Sachs
Well, yes that shell that you guys had articulated, there were sort of an extra $2 billion in the CapEx that was related to that 450 shell.
Stacy J. Smith
That one is down a little bit, but not a lot. It does change my round. I was rounding up to $2 billion and now I’d round to $1.5 billion, but it’s in the scheme of the billion dollar changes, it’s not the largest driver. It’s not even that large of a driver. I think its interesting when you deconstruct those CapEx and you just kind of get down to the level of CapEx that’s in place for – at current run rate. You take out the 450, you can take out some of the capital has been spend not necessarily for our current production, but things like IT and labs, you take out some of the Greenfield space that we’ve built in place and you get down to a run rate of CapEx kind of in support of the current business that’s in the mid 50s and $55 billion or so in revenue, in that range. That is I think a nice healthy level, nice sustainable level and I can run at that level and generate a 60% gross margin. So, it feels pretty good from that perspective and as we said we’re continuing to try to balance the CapEx relative to the business size.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs
Sure. And if I – I will use my follow-up on the CapEx as well, so it’s great to see the CapEx come down from the ’13 originally to the ’11 today. The first half spending is 409, so that would still imply pretty far below the ’11. Obviously that shell – may be a little more that shell comes in the back half, so that would be some of the increase in the back half CapEx. But can we get any kind of hope that potentially even ’11 is the number that there is some downside too?
Stacy J. Smith
No. So first, the linearity actually, the more of that shell, most of that shell frankly is in the back half of the year, that shifts the linearity and you also see the 14 nanometer spending going up in the back half. So it’s kind of a back half loaded year. I think as I said earlier, we’ll continue to look for the right balance between capital and demand, but I want to stress when you really deconstruct our CapEx at kind of $7 billion to $8 billion of capital being spent to support a business that's in the mid-$50 billion in revenue, it's the right level of CapEx. I'm very comfortable with that. It's not putting in a bunch of incremental capacity and it's a level that I can sustain, gross margin that's in that range as I've been talking about and kind of right at 60%.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs
Thank you very much.
Stacy J. Smith
Sure.

The next question comes from Tristan Gerra from Baird.
Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird
Hi. Good afternoon. Years ago when Atom first launched, I think you had mentioned that Atom was slightly lower gross margin, but same or slightly higher operating margin than the corporate average. Is that view still holding with the new products that you're launching?
Stacy J. Smith
This is probably a better conversation for the investor meeting and keep in mind that Atom spans from servers to the PC segment of the market. Now we're enabling these 299 price points to phones, to tablets, right? So it's worthwhile to have a deeper discussion about the different segments. As we articulated earlier, generally when you're looking at the predominance of our volume, the Core business, when Atom is price point replacing Celeron or Pentium, we're doing it at a better margin dollars per unit than we were selling Celeron into that space and we're enabling lower price points. So from that perspective, it's a great product. It lets us kind of fight on the front foot and go after markets profitably that we had trouble to go after before. I'll save the rest probably until the investor meeting.
Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird
Okay, that's useful. And then on this call, there has been obviously a good amount of discussion about your diversification into ultra-mobile. If we look at the Core business, the ramp of Haswell and the ultra-books obviously hasn't been enough to bring back PC unit growth this year. Should we have the view that PC is basically past the peak, continues to decline and if not, what catalysts do you see going forward and why – what hasn't worked so far could work later in revitalizing PC growth going forward?
Brian M. Krzanich
So let me – we had a hard time hearing that one because of the break and the networking problems we're having on this end. Let me try and repeat it and make sure – I think probably your question – or the basic of your question was PCs have continued to decline. You've introduced Haswell. You're still forecasting a back half decline. What gives us confidence that we'll be able to turn that around or make any change in that? Did I capture your question correctly?
Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird
Yes, that's correct. Thank you.
Brian M. Krzanich
I'll answer first and Stacy can jump in. My answer would be simply Haswell has been not a single product launch. So let me first start with Haswell. We launched the Quad Core products in the second quarter. As we go into the third quarter, the Dual Core products, which go more into those lower price point region is actually going out to the market. So it's a staggered launch, which is a little bit different than we've done with some other product. So we're just now really starting to see the ramp of Haswell into the consumers' hands. So I think it's really way too early to say here's where Haswell is. And you're just going to see as we move into the second half some fan-less devices with Haswell. As we move forward, Bay Trail and 14-nanometer as we move into next year, well you can imagine we'll drive prices and battery life and the number of fan-less devices up even more. So that will be my first answer.
The second answer I'd tell you what's different moving forward, again we've kind of talked about this is Bay Trail. Bay Trail is going into some of these same classic PC devices that you see today. The clamshells where they've got touch-enabled clamshells coming down into the $300 range. You're going to see convertible clamshells where you can detach or flip and it access both a tablet or a PC in the sub-$400 range, right around $400. As we move into next year, those price points will continue to drop. So the fact that PCs especially with Bay Trail are going to move down into this, let's call it $200 to $400 range, is going to shift that market we believe as well and that's different than what's been out over the last few years. So you've got fan-less Haswell. You've got Bay Trail coming in. All of those things allowing devices that haven't been allowed in the past with our designs.
Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird
Thank you very much.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by and welcome to the Intel Corporation's first quarter 2013 earnings conference call.  [Operator instructions.]   I would now like to introduce your host for today’s conference, Mark Henninger, director of investor relations.  Sir, you may begin.  
Mark Henninger
Thanks, operator, and welcome everyone to Intel's first quarter 2013 conference call. By now you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with that. If you've not received both documents, they are currently available on our Investor website, intc.com.
I'm joined today by Paul Otellini, our president and CEO; and Stacy Smith, our chief financial officer. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them followed by the Q&A.
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.
Also, if during this call we use any non-GAAP financial measures or references, we'll post the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliations to our website, intc.com. Lastly, I'd like to highlight that this year and going forward, we'll be holding our Annual Investor Meeting in the fall, rather than in May. We will send out a further date notice this spring with all the important event logistics and we will look forward to seeing you there.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Paul.
Paul Otellini 
Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon.  As you know, I have a month left in my career at Intel, and this will be my last conference call with you.  I’ve been doing these calls since 1993, and have done approximately 80 calls with you.  I want to take a departure from my traditional remarks during this, my final earnings call.  During the next few minutes, I’d like to share some perspective on the company and on our industry, drawing from my career and my experience as Intel’s fifth CEO.  
I came to Intel nearly 40 years ago, eager to join the team of extraordinarily smart, creative, and driven engineers and the legendary team of founders, some of the greatest minds in technology.  In 1974, Intel was still a startup, with revenues of $134 million and a culture built on relentless innovation and designed to thrive on change.
A revolution in computing had just begun, but it would take us another decade before we realized how dramatically it would change our business and the world.  Amid all that change and reinvention, there has, however, been a constant.  From the early days of DRAM to the era of the first microprocessor, from one architectural battle to the next, and across generations of form factors and operating systems, Intel has grown and thrived.
Naturally, constant change and reinvention creates plenty of room for both opportunity and skepticism.  As the industry and the company evolved, risk and uncertainty were common, but the company’s inventiveness, architectural innovation, manufacturing expertise, and intense drive allowed it to create and capitalize on the opportunity over the long haul.  
In May of 2005, I became CEO and over the past eight years, we’ve executed a broad strategy to reposition the company to participate in all segments of computing by capitalizing on all of our considerable strengths.  
We implemented the Tick-Tock model, which set the pace of innovation and has become an industry benchmark of execution.  We developed the Atom microarchitecture to address low power and low cost market segments.  
Through the acquisitions of Infineon Wireless Solutions and McAfee, we’ve invested in strategic capabilities like baseband technology and security that position us to deliver important new capabilities and compete across an even broader range of devices.  And, we’ve invented and implemented manufacturing breakthroughs that are allowing us to deliver on the promise and competitive benefits of Moore’s Law.  
Never in the history of our company has our ability to participate across the spectrum of computing been greater.  From industrial machines that are increasingly connected to the internet to the smallest battery powered devices, from traditional PCs to ultrabooks, and from high performance servers to microservers, storage, and networking equipment, we now compete wherever there is computing.
At the same time, we’ve put more distance between us and the rest of the semiconductor industry than ever before.  In the first quarter, we shipped our 100 millionth 22 nanometer processor, using our revolutionary 3D transistor technology, while the rest of the industry works to ship its first unit.  
That breakthrough is just one in a long history of materials science firsts, following innovations like string silicon and high-K metal gate.  This leadership in materials science and manufacturing technology is the foundation on which our future success will be based, arming us the world’s lowest power and lowest cost transistors.  
But even as I prepare to pass the baton to a new generation of leadership, I know Intel’s story is nowhere near completely written.  I’m excited about what lies ahead for Intel.  The company has a historically broad portfolio of products, spanning the spectrum of computing and price points, and as we begin to transition to 14 nanometer technology later this year, our architectural and [processor] technology investments and innovations will become increasingly apparent and valuable for our customers, and to the market.  
Over the past few months, I’ve been traveling to our sites here in the U.S. and around the world.  That creativity and drive that first attracted me to Intel almost four decades ago has never been higher. The company’s core architectural and manufacturing strength have never been more valuable, and the opportunity presented by the evolution and expansion of the computing industry has never been greater.  
It’s for those reasons that I’m confident that Intel will continue to invent, grow, thrive, and deliver the best technology to a world increasingly hungry for the products of the microprocessor revolution.  With that, let me turn the meeting over to Stacy.
Stacy Smith 
Thanks, Paul.  I’d like to take a minute and talk about what we’re seeing in each of the segments of our business and our expectations as we look forward to the rest of the year.  Starting with the PC client group.  PC client volumes were down seasonally in the first quarter, consistent with our expectations.  In addition, we believe the worldwide PC supply chain saw a continued reduction in inventory levels in the first quarter as customers decreased inventory of older generation PCs.
In the second quarter, we will launch Haswell, enabling a new wave of ultra-sleek designs across multiple form factors by our customers.  We believe the combination of an improving macroeconomic environment, Haswell coming to the market; ultramobile form factors like ultrabooks, convertibles, and tablets; and touch-enabled devices leads to a return to growth in the second half of the year.
Moving to the data center group, data center group revenue in the first quarter grew 7% from a year ago.  On a year on year basis, we saw significant growth in both the cloud and high-performance computing segments of the market.  We continue to refresh our product line to expand our offerings across all ranges of performance, performance per watt, and performance per watt per dollar.
At IDF Beijing last week, we announced that our next-generation Atom processor for the microserver segment of the market, code named Avoton, and our Ivy Bridge product for Xeon [cloud] servers, will be shipping in the second half.  These leadership products, coupled with our leading-edge [process] technology and the secular growth trends of the data [center] markets, give us confidence in double digit revenue growth for the year.  
We are making significant progress in tablets and phones.  First quarter tablet volume more than doubled from the fourth quarter, and we expect it to double again in the second quarter.  We have shipping designs across both Windows 8 and Android operating systems.  In the second half, we will launch Bay Trail, which will further extend our product line across screen sizes and price points.
In the phone segment, we had a good first quarter in our baseband business.  We are shipping LTE versions today, and are on track to ship multimode voice and data LTE baseband solutions by the end of this year.  We are winning designs with our new Clover Trail+ apps processor, where customers and third parties are highlighting both the performance and power efficiency of our architecture and are on track to ship our next-generation product, code named Merrifield, by the end of this year.
In other important segments of our business, we saw year on year growth in both our software and services group and our NAND business.  
Turning to our financials, first quarter revenue finished at $12.6 billion, in line with our expectations.  We are forecasting revenue of $12.9 billion for the second quarter, which is slightly higher than the average seasonal increase, as we expect some pipeline inventory replenishment as we launch Haswell and in anticipation of a stronger second half.
Gross margin of 56% was down 2 points from expectations.  Increased demand from our customers allowed us to increase production of Haswell products prior to qualification for sale.  The result of this was a higher than anticipated inventory writeoff, which we expect to get back throughout the rest of the year as the product is expected to qualify for sale in the second quarter.  
In addition, we saw higher than expected excess capacity charges in older generation process technologies.  We are taking advantage of the excess capacity on older generation process technologies to take capacity offline and reuse more equipment and space for 14 nanometer and beyond.  
The results of these actions allow us to lower our capital spending forecast for the year by $1 billion, down to $12 billion.  In addition, our inventories decreased almost $400 million from the fourth quarter.  For the second quarter, we expect gross margin to increase 2 points to 58%, and the gross margin forecast for the year remains 60%, with gross margins in the second half back into the low 60s.
Operating income for the first quarter was $2.5 billion, with earnings per share of $0.40.  Taking a look at the balance sheet, total cash investments ended the quarter at $17.1 billion, down $1.1 billion from the fourth quarter.  The reduction in cash was the result of shifting almost $1 billion from short term to longer term investments.  
In the first quarter, we generated approximately $4 billion in cash from operations, paid approximately $1 billion in dividends, purchased a little over $2 billion in capital assets, and repurchased $500 million in stock.
As Paul said, our manufacturing leadership is extending, and gives us the world’s lowest cost and lowest power transistors.  In the first quarter, we shipped our first silicon to a foundry customer, and we announced a significant foundry design win with Altera, who will move their leading edge products to our 14 nanometer process technology.  
Building on this leadership, we are on track to start production on 14 nanometer process technology in the back half of this year.  The combination of an improving macroeconomic environment and new products coming to the market over the course of the year to take advantage of our manufacturing leadership increases our confidence in being able to achieve financial growth in the second half of 2013.
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.  
Mark Henninger
Thank you, Paul and Stacy.  Before we begin the Q&A, I do recognize that there are questions about the upcoming CEO transition.  The selection process is on track, and the board’s goal remains to name a successor by the time Paul retires at the annual shareholder meeting in May.  Beyond this, we won’t be offering any additional commentary on the status of the process or the candidates today.  
Moving on to the Q&A, as is our long practice, we would ask each participant to ask one question and just one follow up if you have one.  With that, operator, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.  
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator instructions.]  Our first question comes from Sumit Dhanda of ISI Group.  Your line is now open.  
Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group
Two questions for you.  Stacy, it seems like notebook ASPs were up a little bit sequentially based on the data that you provided in the CFO commentary.  Could you help us understand what that was due to?  Was it enterprise versus consumer mix?  Or was there a bigger proportion of touch that was shipped in the quarter?  
Stacy Smith 
There wasn’t very significant change quarter on quarter in terms of notebook ASPs.  I would just characterize it as a fairly benign pricing environment.  The way we characterized it at the beginning of the year is that we have, I think, a strong product position really across different form factors in the market, and it played out as we expected.  So I’d characterize that as just not a lot of change from the way we saw things a quarter ago.   
Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group 
And then for my follow up, just on the server piece, the last couple of quarters units were pretty flat, and then volumes were down [6%] in the calendar first quarter.  I would have thought that would be easy comps.  You might have seen a slightly better volume pickup in that business.  Anything you could talk to with respect to why that did not occur?
Stacy Smith 
On a year over year comparison, units were up, and ASP was up a little bit in the data center group.  I think it’s a little bit of an improvement of what we saw in the fourth quarter in the enterprise segment of the data center.  And then we continue to see very robust growth rates across the high-performance computing and the big [IT] data centers that support the cloud.  So it’s a nice continuation of growth in those segments, and a little bit better in the enterprise segment.  And as I think forward to the back half of the year, my suspicion is we’ll start to see the enterprise segment growing again just based on macroeconomic improvement.
Operator
Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava of BMO Capital Markets.  Your line is now open.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets

A couple of questions.  My first one is Stacy, if you could please talk about the capacity.  How much of the capex can be moderated lower, if the PC industry continues to be weaker than probably what you thought going into the year?  
Stacy Smith 
I think we’re really well-positioned right now from a factory and utilization standpoint.  And let me just realign what we did in the first quarter.  We saw that units were a little bit weaker than we expected and our expectations came down a bit.  That allowed us to bring utilization down on some older generation process technology.  
You can see we brought our inventory levels down pretty significantly, and actually a little bit more than I thought when I started the quarter.  And we took $1 billion out of capex by rolling forward some older generation technologies to offset things that we needed to buy for 14 nanometer and new process technologies.  
In terms of your question of the levers that we have, I think that’s a good example of how we can be responsive in a very tactical time horizon to changes in demand.  And as I look forward across the year, the prediction right now is we’re going to run at a healthy rate of utilization.  In fact, we’re starting the quarter at that utilization rate.  I think inventories will continue to be healthy.  
If demand turns out to be stronger, we have some white space that we can grow into, so we can respond up.  If demand ends up being a little weaker than we thought, you saw the playbook in Q1.  We can pretty quickly react and bring capex down if that’s the case.  
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets 
And then my follow up on the foundry strategy, maybe for Paul or for you, what’s the long term vision.  Getting Altera was a feather in your cap, but then looking out ahead, what implication does that have for business mix and also for the long term margin structure for the company?
Paul Otellini 
I’ve described the strategy before as a crawl, walk, run strategy.  We’re past crawling.  We’re in the mode of collecting serious customers.  The design win activity leads the announcement activity, as you’d expect in this business, and there are some other customers that we still have not yet publicly announced.
In terms of the business, as Stacy said I think last quarter, it will not have a significant revenue impact to the company for two to three years.  That’s the design cycle for these products.  And in the case of someone like Altera, the products tend to run for quite some time.  So think of that as something that will start two-plus years from now and run for quite a number of years thereafter on several generations of technology.
The business model that we have for the foundry assumes value based pricing.  The people that we are soliciting and people that are attracted to us are those who see the advantages of our technology as it manifests itself in their products and gives them an advantage in the marketplace.  So it’s a healthy business for us.
Operator
Our next question comes from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse.  Your line is now open.  
 
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
First, just relative to what your units did in PCG versus some third-party data and kind of your commentary that you thought that the PC supply chain went through an inventory reduction.  There seems to be a little bit of a mismatch, where you guys have outperformed.  To what extend is that just netbooks not being classified in your PC group and being classified in third-party data, and to what extent is that emerging market strength perhaps picking up that the third-party data’s not sort of capturing?
Stacy Smith 
I’ll start by saying when you take into account all of the different categories that the third parties are looking at, I think we’re pretty aligned with how they view the year.  And so you start with the traditional PC segment of the market, we do expect that to be down.  We expect netbooks to be down significantly.  You can see that in our other IAG results, and in fact it’s getting close to zero.  That category is coming to the end of its life.
And then we see some of the new form factors of computing are growing significantly.   Gartner would call those ultramobile devices, so things like ultrabooks, detachables, convertibles.  We’re seeing robust growth there.  And then we’re now participating across a broad range of tablets between Windows 8 and Android.  And with Bay Trail coming out and Merrifield behind that, we start to participate in a much broader set of screen sizes and price points than we are today.  
And so when you net all of this up, and you look broadly at the market for computing, you see some of the traditional form factors down.  You see growth in these new form factors.  We get to kind of very slight unit growth for the year and that’s pretty consistent with how the third parties are viewing the year.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse 

And then Stacy, as my follow on, just the operating profitability of DCG was down about 500 basis points sequentially.  And I guess it’s the lowest in the data set that I’m looking at.  Is that incremental opex you guys trying to broaden out into new areas like networking and storage?  Is that a gross margin problem?  Can you help me understand the profitability?  And when do we get back to that 50% op margin that we saw maybe five quarters ago, if ever?
Stacy Smith 
It’s a combination of two things, and you’ll notice that it’s also impacting PCG.  As we said at the beginning of the quarter, we had significant excess capacity charges that hit both PCG and DCG, and we had a big increase in startup costs as you kind of expect, based on where we are in the 14 nanometer ramp, and those two business units are the ones that really drive both of those, and so that’s where those costs hit.  
So as the gross margin improves, we expect that Q1 is the bottom.  It’s up a bit in Q2, and then a back half that’s back into the low 60s.  You’ll see the operating profit moving back into what you’ve historically come to expect in DCG.
Operator
Our next question comes from Chris Danely with JP Morgan.  Your line is now open.  
 
Chris Danely - JP Morgan

I guess my first question is on the foundry business.  Paul, you said the response has been tremendous.  You’ve also, in the past, said that you probably wouldn’t take any business that was ARM processor/potential competitor to yourself in the PC or the handset arena.  Has that stance changed at all?
Paul Otellini 

No, it hasn’t.  I think the ground rules that we’ve laid out, I have three that I was looking at.  One would be value-based pricing, to take advantage of our technology.  The second is that we would not enable a chip competitor.  And the third, that we have not mentioned on the call yet today, is that it would be great if we could form a strategic relationship with a customer so that it went beyond just a single foundry transaction.
Chris Danely - JP Morgan 
And then for my follow up, if you look at the sequentials for Q1/Q2 this year, it’s pretty similar to last year.  I know none of us want a repeat of the second half of last year.  Could you just maybe compare and contrast, and what gives you confidence that we’re not going to see a repeat of last year in the second half of the year for sales?
Stacy Smith 

What gives me confidence in the second half of 2013 really comes down to two things.  One, we do expect that the macro environment will improve.  That’s consistent with what we’re seeing from most economists now.  That could be a repeat to what we thought last year.  I think the world was expecting a stronger macroeconomic second half of ’12, but it didn’t materialize.  So that is my believe right now.
That will directly impact our data center business.  There’s a big portion of that business that really is correlated to GDP growth when you look at it over a long period of time.  
And then secondly is our product portfolio, and we now participate across a broad range of devices, tablets and convertibles and attachables, and phones, although phones won’t really drive the results in the second half.  And so we can embrace this broad market for computing now, and wherever the demand increases, we can participate in it.  
And a year ago, we were in the middle of that transition, and so as tablets ramped, and in particular as [unintelligible] tablets ramped, we really weren’t in a position to participate in those segments of the market.   
Paul Otellini 
I had a third thing, Chris, which I think is as the OEMs start looking at new form factors that they can design around our new chips, Haswell in particular, and maybe Bay Trail, and Windows 8, enabling touch, the explosion in form factors and the competitiveness of that platform is going to be substantially different, at price points down into the $300 to $400 range enabling touch.  We didn’t have that last year.  So you go into the prime selling season with new products, new technologies, new form factors, and new capabilities that, up to now, were unapproachable price points.
Operator
Our next question comes from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank.  Your line is now open.  
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
My first question, moving on to the DCG side, again, I know you said, Stacy, that you’re confident in double-digit growth for the year and that macro is a big part of it.  Is there any sort of granularity you can give us to get us across that bridge from what seemed to be a relatively weak start to the year, whether by the end markets within that segment or new products?  Anything you can help us with would be great.
Stacy Smith 
I’ll give you a little bit of color commentary on Q1, just so you can kind of see what we’re seeing in terms of growth rates.  If you look at the traditional enterprise segment of the market on a year over year basis, as I said earlier, it’s growing a little bit, but think of it as a pretty low growth rate.  And that’s compared to the last couple of quarters, where we saw that market in decline.  So I think you’d say it’s improving, but it’s not robust.
And then we continue to see very high rates of growth in things like the cloud and high-performance computing.  And when I say high rates of growth, think of things that are in the 20%, 30%, 40% year on year unit growth rates in those segments of the market.  I think that second piece is really a secular driver.  It’s all these devices computing, connecting to the internet, driving the [unintelligible] out of the cloud.  And then the first piece, I think, is improving and will likely improve into the second half.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank 
I guess for my follow up, thinking a little bit about inventory and how it plays along into utilization.  You guys over the last two quarters have taken the better part of $1 billion out of your inventory.  A year ago at this time, you started ramping that back up, then obviously demand was a problem and you had to go back to the underutilization side of things.  
Are you going to be a bit more cautious on the pace of utilization and inventory build this year, or are some of the things macro-wise and product-wise that are giving you confidence in the back half demand is going to lead you to the same behavior or just as aggressive as a year ago?  
Stacy Smith
I think we’re on a path where inventory levels in the year are no more than what we have today and likely less than what we have today.  I think we’re all learning how to operate more efficiently.  Now, it may go up a little bit in the second quarter as the various versions of Haswell qualify, which is part of the story for the Q1 margin miss.  And it will continue to manage things very lean.  
And as I said in answer to a question earlier, we’re now in a really nice position where we have the capability to flex capacity up if we need to, and so they don’t need to run with big inventory levels.

Our next question comes from James Covello of Goldman Sachs.  Your line is now open.
James Covello – Goldman Sachs
The last time PC units were at this level was Q2 ’09, and your quarter capex was less than $1 billion.  It was $981 million.  The full year capex guidance implies you’re going to be spending three times that amount in quarterly capex for the rest of the year.  Why do you need that much capacity when units are at the same levels as then?
Stacy Smith 
Let me put capex in maybe a broader context.  First, if you take out the 450 mm, we’re down a couple billion dollars from where we were last year.  Pretty significant reduction.  And if you just look at our capital spending as a percent of revenue relative to the last several years, we’re in the high teens and the last couple of years we’ve been in the low 20s.  So I think we’re kind of in the range.  
And you compare that against some of the people we compare against, a TSMC or a Samsung, they’re spending some significant multiple of capex relative to revenue than what we are.  So I think we’re spending the right amount.  I think we can be responsive if the market ends up a little bit weaker.  I think we have the ability to flex up if the market ends up being stronger.  I’m very comfortable with our positioning.  
And as I just discussed with Ross, the operational indicators look really good.  I think we’re at a healthy level of inventory.  We brought it down to $400 million this quarter.  We’re running healthy utilization, and I expect both of those to continue through the year.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs 
I absolutely appreciate the perspective around the numbers, but it still doesn’t really answer why it needs to be 3x higher than when units were at the same level.
Stacy Smith 
I think if you do any quarter compare, capital spending tends to be over a long period of time.  So if you look at it on an annual basis, what we’re forecasting for this year is kind of down a little bit on a percent of revenue relative to what we spent in ’10, ’11, and ’12.  2009 is a weird comparison point, because you’re in the aftermath of the financial meltdown, and as we disclosed to you at that time, that gave us the ability to roll forward entire factories full of equipment from one process generation to the next.  I think if you choose that particular time period, you’re going to a weird compare.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs 
Okay, I was just picking it because that’s the last time units were at this level, but I understand.  That’s helpful.  Thank you.

Our next question comes from David Wong of Wells Fargo.  Your line is now open.
David Wong - Wells Fargo
Just to clarify some of the numbers, you mentioned the 450 mm spending.  Is that still assumed to be about $2 billion for this year and therefore your spending on your core capex for this year is planned to be about $10 billion, down from $11 billion last year?  Is that the way the numbers work?
Stacy Smith 
Yes, that’s correct.
David Wong - Wells Fargo 
And the other thing is, in your full year revenue guidance, can you give us any idea of roughly what percentage of full year sales might be related to tablets and smartphones, what’s assumed for that?
Stacy Smith 
Let me take it at a higher level, and I’ll get to that, but the short answer is smartphones, it doesn’t move the needle for us from a revenue standpoint as we’ve said.  We’re in the design win phase there.  Tablets is interesting, but I want to talk about that in the context of kind of the broader market for computing.  
So let’s start with the data center.  It’s about 20% of our revenue.  We’ve said we expect it to be double-digit growth.  So if you just do simple manager math, that says it’s just the data center is giving a couple of points, maybe a smidge more than that, to the company’s growth rate that we’ve said is low single digits.  So just the data center kind of gets us there.  
Within the broader market for computing, it’s the answer I gave John earlier, which is we’re seeing a decline in some of the additional form factors.  We’re seeing an increase in things like ultrabooks, convertibles, tablets.  We’re refreshing our product line there.  When you net all that out, you get to some very modest unit growth across all of those devices.  
So think of that as being flattish, up a smidge.  And then the rest of it is relatively small compared to those two businesses.  And that’s how you get to low single digit growth for the company.

Our next question comes from Vivek Arya of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  Your line is now open.  
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch

My first question is so far Windows 8 traction has been well below expectations relative to your last earnings call.  So what specifically in Haswell can help turn it around?  And can you give us a sense of how your customers are thinking about how they will roll out products when Haswell comes around?  What will really change in the landscape to improve PC market traction?
Paul Otellini 
With Haswell, there’s a number of things.  First of all, the overall performance goes up, graphics performance goes up, as well as the integer performance.  So it’s a better punch in the package than we’ve had with Ivy Bridge.  Point one.  Point two, the power envelope, or the batter life for that level of performance, is exceptionally better than Ivy Bridge.  
Third, it gets into the form factor innovation and the integration with touch as I spoke about earlier, which I think is really part of the recipe required for Win 8 adoption.  I’ve recently converted personally to Windows 8 with touch, and it is a better Windows than Windows 7 in the desktop mode, when you implement the touch and the touch-based applications and operating environment.  It’s just a lot easier to use.   
There is an adoption curve, and once you get over that adoption curve, I don’t think you go back.  And we didn’t quite have that same kind of adoption curve in Windows 7 versus XP before it.  This requires a little bit of training.  And I think people are attracted to touch, and the touch price points today are still fairly high, and they’re coming down very rapidly over the next couple of quarters.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch 
And as my follow up, Stacy, the buyback slowed down to I think about a $500 million in the last quarter.  You were above $1 billion in prior quarters.  How should we think about buyback activity for this year?  How should we think about overall users of cash for this year.
Stacy Smith 
As I think you know, we don’t share prospectively what we’re planning to do with the buyback, just as a matter of policy.  What I can share with you is that our priorities are still the priorities that we’ve been talking about.  It’s investing in our business first, it’s dividends second.  And I shared with you the expectation that we want a dividend that’s on the order of 40% of free cash flow.  And I think that’s giving us a pretty good dividend yield today.  
And then buybacks we use as the other way to return cash to shareholders and to modulate cash balance.  And so what you can take from less buybacks is just that I’m comfortable with the cash balances.   

Operator
Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon of Sanford Bernstein.  
Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein
You spoke before about your increased confidence now versus last year.  But if I’m just looking over the last three months, we have weaker results in Q1, which raises the operational bar for the second half, on both top line and gross margin, which suggests you’re even more confident in that back half ramp than you were three months ago, even in the wake of what looks to be pretty challenging market data.  You’re also taking capex down, though, which would belie that increased confidence some.  
I was just wondering, could you help me identify the sources of that increased confidence in that back half ramp versus where you were three months ago, as well as help me rationalize that with the cut to the capex outlook.  
Stacy Smith 
First of all, just to make sure I’m not oversoaking things here, you really just need seasonal from where we are in order to achieve the low single digit revenue growth.  So I don’t think we have a hugely high bar out there, and I went through a dissection of where I think the revenue comes from.  
In terms of the things that give me confidence, or at least I personally believe it could be better than seasonal, it’s the things we talked about, improving macroeconomic environment, the fact that we now are participating across a range of compute devices, and so the mix between those don’t impact us nearly as much.  
And then third, as Paul said, you have innovative form factors coming out in ultrabooks, in convertibles, and in detachables, that are hitting these really compelling mainstream price points that are touch enabled.  And as we get into the Christmas selling season, your expectation is you will see touch-enabled ultrabooks that are $499 and $599 pretty commonly out there.  $599 commonly, and $499 as kind of special SKUs.  
And then we’ll see, because of Bay Trail coming into the marketplace, you’ll see touch-enabled thin notebooks with really good performance that are hitting kind of $300 price points.  And then with our Android tablets, you’ll see things that are significantly, [hey, I have that].  So we’ll be participating across a broad range of compute devices as we get into the back half of this year.
Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein
For my follow up, I wanted to dig a little bit into the trajectory of your fab output.  It sounds to me like your current [time] to loading is similar to what you had last quarter, which I think was full fabs on the second half.  It almost sounds like you may be running close to full right now.  
What does that mean for your expectations for how much your fab output may grow in 2014, year over year.  I would think you anticipate running full in 2014, and we were pretty lean in the first part of 2013.  Would double digit upside be the right way to think about that in terms of fab output?  And how much of that increase might be inventory replenishment versus demand upside?   
Stacy Smith 
I think it’s early to talk about 2014 at this point.  We have the ability to respond to lots of different volume scenarios for 2014.  If it’s large, we can put on more capacity.  If it ends up being closer to a bust, we can play the playbook we played…
Paul Otellini 
We’ve also got the technology transition to the 14 nanometers.  [unintelligible] a first order, all of our spending is focused on 14 nanometers , which gives us a fairly significant ramp capability.  If demand for older products exceeds what we could build on 14, we could still build 22 for quite some time.  So I really think it depends on whatever demand scenario you see out there.  In any event, the most important thing for us is to make that transition to 14 and continue to have the leading edge.
Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein 
And I understand that.  Just mathematically, though, if I’m running full in 2014 and I was pretty empty in the first part of 2013, even if you’re not adding a tremendous amount of capacity, doesn’t that imply a very significant uptick in your fab output in ‘14 versus ’13, if ’13 is flattish to ’12, and in ’12 we already had too much?  Mathematically, what does it imply if you’re running full in 2014 even if you don’t add anything?
Paul Otellini 
We haven’t talked about 2014.
Stacy Smith
Yeah, and I think what you’re equation misses there is that we roll forward capacity.  So we take capacity offline.  Think of the change in capex at a first approximation of we took older generation technology offline a little faster than we thought.  And we offset stuff that we were going to buy to make the transition and to build towards that 14 nanometer peak.  We don’t actually have to choose the 14 nanometer peak today.  We can continue to refresh capital.
Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein 
I understand.  I’m just saying if you’re running full in 2014, and you’re not full for ’13, how much would your output [go up]?  Forgetting transitions and 14 nanometers and capex, just on a rough basis, how much are we talking about in terms of increase?
Stacy Smith 
If we’re running full in 2014.  I mean, I’m not sure how to answer that question, because I don’t yet know how much capacity we’re going to put in place for ’14.
Mark Henninger
And Stacy, I think at that point we’ll want to move on to the next questioner.  I’ll be happy to follow up with you a little bit later.

Our next question comes from Doug Freedman of RBC.  Your line is now open.  
Doug Freedman - RBC 
In the past, when you looked at Intel you were successful because your customers were successful.  And right now I think it’s general perception that the PC ecosystem is really not in the greatest state of health.  What is it that you think Intel can do to try to make your customers more successful in the marketplace?
Paul Otellini 
I think continue to give them the tools to innovate.  And I wouldn’t paint the entire customer base with the same brush that you just did.  Certainly if you looked at the last quarter, even inside the PC space, Lenovo outperformed everybody else, and actually had a very good year on year set of numbers, in a down year.  Apple continues to do well.
Subsets of customers in different segments are also doing very well in terms of, say, those.  Those providing products into the internet data centers.  What I see when we look out is a tremendous amount of innovation, particularly at the ODM and Taiwanese OEM side, where the ability to miniaturize and bring things into extremely thin form factors is as revolutionary as the amount of changes I’ve seen in my time in this industry.  
And so I think what we can do is give them the products, like Haswell and Bay Trail to innovate around.  We can help them with other feature sets like voice and speech that go around them, and just help them build better products.
Doug Freedman - RBC 
When we look at sort of what we’re seeing Intel do strategically, that is investing in things outside of what we call core PC, how do I try to quantify how big an investment you’re willing to make in things such as the set top box or in the foundry efforts or other areas of revenue that the company is seeking?
Paul Otellini 
I don’t look at things with quite that level of granularity.  The foundry thing, the investment is really going to be taking advantage, at least near term, with the current customer base, of capacity that we’re already putting in place.  That doesn’t mean that at some point we won’t have to actually build extra capacity for a foundry customer or a foundry business, but today, up to this point, it’s certainly within our ability to absorb.  
The set top box spending, or the stuff we’re doing in Intel media, in the grand scheme of things, is not a lot of spending.  So the real issue is inside of our core microprocessor and platform development, and we’re at the point now where roughly half of our spending is focused on system on chip, inside the microprocessor world.  
And the system on chip environment is really a lot of the ultramobile products.  It’s the phones, it’s the tablets.  It’s embedded systems.  It’s automotive, etc. Where we have fairly strong growth opportunities.  So it’s not the same monolithic Tick-Tock model that we put in place eight years ago.  
Mark Henninger
Operator, we’ll go ahead and take two more questions.  

Operator
Our next question comes from Joseph Moore of Morgan Stanley.  Your line is now open.  
Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley

My question is on the commentary that the pipeline inventory replenishment will be a driver for slightly higher than seasonal Q2.  Can you put some perspective on that?  It seems like you normally have new products in Q2, and you normally have strength in Q3.  Is the current inventory level lean, or how should we view that inventory replenishment comment?
Stacy Smith 
I think inventory levels generally are lean everywhere we look.  We saw an inventory burn in the broader pipeline in Q1.  And our inventory levels are down more than I expected when I started the quarter, and down pretty significantly.  So I think inventory levels are lean.  
And I also want to put it in perspective.  You’re talking a minor difference.  Being up 3% quarter on quarter is kind of well within Q1 the Q2 seasonality.  I don’t think there’s any one big driver there.  I think we’ll see people putting in place some Haswell based systems in anticipation of the second half selling season, just as they burned inventory on some of the older generation systems in the first quarter.  
Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley 
And then in terms of ultrabook, last year you had given pretty precise targets on where you wanted that to come out as a percentage of consumer notebooks.  To the extent that you’re willing to talk about it, can you give us any kind of qualitative assessment of where you think those penetration numbers will go this year, and any kind of goals or targets that you may have?
Stacy Smith 
There’s a market for ultrabooks, and it’s a sizable market.  I mean, if you look at Gartner data, it’s growing robustly.  But there’s this reinvention going on just broadly across the notebook.  And we’re seeing now the percent of thin and light notebooks relative to the total notebook market that are kind of on the order of a third of the market.  And I think that grows from here as we hit price points.  
So I think the reinvention of the form factor is well underway.  Some of those are going to be more premium ultrabooks with touch and then new form factors of convertibles and detachables.  A big chunk of that is going to be that wedge of volume behind that, which are thin and light touch enabled notebooks that aren’t categorized as ultrabook.  All of that is good for us.  
Operator
Our final question comes from Timothy Arcuri of Cowen & Company.  Your line is now open.  
Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Company
I wanted to ask a question about the mix between bricks and mortar and equipment spending.  You had said before, when you had guided core capex minus the 450 mm spending of ’11 flat, you said the equipment portion would be up pretty sizably year over year.  So since you cut $1 billion out of that, will the equipment portion still be up?  Or is it now down?
Stacy Smith 
I haven’t looked at that math.  You’re right.  The way I characterized it, we spent about 40% of our capex in 2012 on equipment.  That percentage came down in 2013.  More of the cut to capex was equipment than realignment of space, so I’d have to go back and look at the map.  And that’s typically something we share with you in the November investor meeting, to just kind of give you a sense of where is the capex going and then some color commentary over the next couple of years.
Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Company 
And then just second thing, you just gave some price points for touch-enabled notebooks that I look back at my notes and you were previously saying $599 to $799 for touch-enabled notebooks, and now from what you just said I think you were saying that you’re going to have some at $499 with line of sight down to $300.  That’s quite a bit lower.  So I’m wondering, did something change?  Because at those price points, you get a much different demand profile.
Paul Otellini 
Separate ultrabook versus notebook.
Stacy Smith 
These are touch-enabled notebooks.
Paul Otellini 
We have a certain spec for ultrabooks, and that is the product that Stacy said is going to be centered at as low as $599 with some [diverse] SKUs to $499.  If you look at touch-enabled Intel based notebooks that are ultrathin and light using non-core processors, those prices are going to be down to as low as $200 probably.
Stacy Smith 
And I’d say the big change over the last 12 months there is that Bay Trail is going to be a great product in that segment of the market.  We think it enables stunning performance relative to what the competition can bring.  And it’s going to enable these price points.  A year ago, we didn’t really have line of sight to hitting that, and today we’re cleanly there.

Good day ladies and gentlemen and thank you for standing by and welcome to the Intel Corporation's fourth quarter 2012 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference may be recorded.
It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Mark Henninger with investor relations. Please go-ahead.
Mark Henninger
Thank you, Huey, and welcome everyone to Intel's fourth quarter 2012 earnings conference call. By now you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with that. If you've not received both documents, they are currently available on our Investor website, intc.com.
I'm joined today by Paul Otellini, our President and CEO; and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them followed by Q&A.
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.
If during this call we use any non-GAAP financial measures or references, we'll post the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliations to our website, intc.com. Lastly, I'd like to highlight that this year and going forward, we'll be holding our Annual Investor Meeting in the fall, rather than in May. We will send out a further date notice this spring with all the important event logistics and we will look forward to seeing you there.
With that, let me turn the call over to Paul.
Paul Otellini
Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon. In 2012, Intel generated almost $1 billion of net income every month. This was in an environment of relatively soft PC demand and weak macroeconomic conditions.
From a product perspective, 2012 was a year of significant transitions in our markets and a year of important milestones for Intel. I'd like to take a moment to recap a few of the most significant developments.
The Data Center Group saw a comprehensive refresh across its product line last year. Romley locked the Sandy Bridge architecture to servers for the first time. While the launches of Knights Corner and Centerton in the fourth quarter expanded the range of DCG Solutions from teraflops to a few watts.
Knights Corner or Xeon Phi brings 60 cores in the familiar Intel architecture programming model to supercomputing applications. At six watts, Centerton is the industry's only low power microserver SoC that delivers critical enterprise features like 64-bit, ECC and virtualization.
Over the last 12 months, we also worked with our industry partners to bring Ultrabooks to the mainstream, ramping from roughly 20 designs to more than 140. At CES last week, I was struck by our industry's renewed inventiveness. PC manufacturers are embracing innovation as we are in the midst of radical transformation of the computing experience with the blurring of form factors and the adoption of new user interfaces.
It's no longer necessary to choose between a PC and a tablet. Convertibles and detachable, combined with Windows 8 and Touch, provide a two for one, no compromise computing experience. Ultrabooks have also served to accelerate the trend towards thinner and lighter notebooks. For example, the volume of systems less than one-inch think grew 18-fold last year in the U.S., and we expect to see the same trend continue around the world.
Last quarter, our customers also began shipping tablets based upon our Clover Trail SoC and Windows 8. These systems boost up to 10 hours of battery life, three weeks of connected standby and come in a range of sleek ultra light form factors, all while bringing the benefits of software compatibility with the millions of Windows applications written for Intel architecture. There are now 10 Clover Trail tablets shipping today with several more launching in the coming months.
2012 was a milestone year for Intel architecture and smartphones with our customers now shipping seven devices across 20 countries. These phones use our 32-nanometer Medfield SoC and our extremely comparative with the best ARM designs on performance and equal or better power and battery life.
We saw the introduction of our 22-nanometer manufacturing process and along with it a revolutionary new tri-gate or 3D transistor technology. 22-nanometer products represented more than half of our volume in the fourth quarter as the rest of the industry works to ship its very first tri-gate designs.
In July, we announced an important strategic relationship with ASML, which combined with our process technology expertise, will accelerate deployment of EUV and 450-millimeter technologies helping to ensure the future of Moore's Law and our growing manufacturing leadership.
Looking ahead to 2013, I am excited about the strong pipeline of our products, we have coming to market. In the first half of this year, we will launch Haswell, enabling one of the most significant changes to the PC since Centrino in 2003. Haswell was designed from the ground up to enable breakthrough innovation in form factor, battery life and usability. It will deliver the single largest generation-to-generation battery life improvement in Intel's history and it is inspiring a new wave of ultra-sleek, convertible, touch-based designs across our customer base.
Later this year, we will ship 22 nanometer versions of our Zion and Atom products for the data center, bringing the power, performance and efficiency benefits of 3D transistor technology to our entire data center product line. In 2013, we will also begin to deliver the industry's first 22 nanometer tablet and smartphone SoCs to OEMs. We are now shipping our single mode data LTE baseband to customers and over the course of the year will begin delivering multimode data and voice modems to customers, giving us a full complement of competitive technologies to grow our device business.
Last, but not least, we will begin our transition to 14 nanometers as we begin the world's first 14 nanometer products towards the end of this year. We see the industry in a period of transition and hyper innovation. We are well-positioned to take advantage of these trends across the spectrum of computing from the lowest-power portable devices to the most powerful data center servers and everywhere in between.
With that, let me turn the meeting over to Stacy.
Stacy Smith
Thanks, Paul. The fourth quarter came in consistent with our expectations for 2012. Although our financial results were below our expectations entering the year, we launched leadership products in every major business segment and we extended our manufacturing leadership. In 2012, revenue was $53.3 billion, gross margin was 62%, operating income was $14.6 billion, net income was $11 billion and earnings per share was two dollars and $0.13.
For the year, the business continued to generate significant cash with almost $19 billion of cash from operations. We increased the dividend per share by 7%, resulting in over $4 billion in dividends paid and repurchased roughly $5 billion of stock. We continue to invest in our manufacturing leadership. We purchased $11 billion in capital assets, primarily building and equipping leading edge factories and made a $3 billion strategic equity investment in ASML.
Lastly, we took advantage of record low interest rates and borrowed $6 billion. Total cash investments ended the year at roughly $18 billion, up approximately $3 billion from a year ago. Revenue of $53.3 billion was down 1% from a year ago and below the expectations we had at the start of the year. Worldwide GDP growth was significantly less than we had thought entering the year and the PC market segment with impacted by the growth of tablets.
Our PC client group was down 3% from a year ago. The data center group grew 6% year-over-year, as a richer mix of products and significant growth in the internet cloud segment of our business was partially offset by weakness in the enterprise server market. Gross margin of 62% in 2012 was flat to 2011 at the high-end of our historical range for the third year in a row.
Our investments in industry leading manufacturing process technology continued to pay off through leadership products and a highly responsive factory network. We invested over $10 billion in research and development in 2012, up almost $2 million from a year ago. The increase was driven by investments in Ultrabooks, the data center, phones and tablets. In addition, we made investments in core capabilities, like security, SoCs and extending our process technology leadership. Spending, as a percent of revenue, was 34%.
Fourth quarter revenue finished at $13.5 billion, in line with expectations. We believe the worldwide PC supply chain saw a continued reduction in inventory levels in the fourth quarter as customers reduced inventory of older generation PCs. Gross margin at 58% was up one point from expectations and down five points from the third quarter. The drop from the third quarter was driven primarily by excess capacity charges as a result of the aggressive tactical actions we took to reduce inventory levels and to redirect space and equipment to 14 nanometer.
Our inventories decreased almost $600 million from the third quarter as a result of these actions. Separately, we start production on our next-generation microarchitecture product code-named Haswell, which we expect to qualify for sale this quarter. This production prior to qualification for sale resulted in an increase in inventory write-offs. Operating income for the fourth quarter was $3.2 billion with earnings per share of $0.48.
As we look forward to the first quarter of 2013, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $12.7 billion, down 6% from the fourth quarter. This forecast is in line with the average seasonal decline for the first quarter.
We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range for the first quarter to be flat at 58% as the impact of higher factory start-up cost and lower volumes are offset by lower excess capacity charges and the qualification for sale of Haswell.
Turning to 2013, we are planning for revenue growth in the low-single digits and forecasting the midpoint of our gross margin range at 60%. Capital spending for our core business is expected to be roughly flat to 2012. Additionally, we will spend roughly $2 billion to start building our first 450-millimeter development facility.
We are forecasting spending for the $18.9 billion, a $700 million increase from 2012. This is the full year impact of the increase to investments and R&D that occurred in 2012 and annual salary increases for 2013. As a result of the significant progress we made in 2012 across all of our product lines, I enter 2013 optimistic about our long-term prospects.
A year ago, we were just introducing the concepts of Ultrabooks to the world. Today, the market has been redefined with thin, light, powerful Ultrabooks and convertibles. A year ago, Intel was not shipping products into the tablet market. Today, we have Clover Trail tablets shipping in the market, delivering performance and power benefits versus what our competitors can do. And in 2013, we will ramp our next generation tablet SoC, codename Bay Trail, in both, the Windows and Android markets.
Intel is now inside seven shipping smartphone designs. And here again, the third-party benchmark show that we are not only capable of matching the competition in power efficiency, we are leading them.
In 2012, we built on the strength of our data center offering and we expect to return to double-digit revenue growth in 2013. And lastly, we built on our manufacturing lead and are well into the ramp of our 22-nanometer factories and will start production on the 14-nanometer process this year. This puts us significantly ahead of the competition. The combination of new products and design wins across all segments and our manufacturing leadership will benefit our business in the quarters to come.
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.
Mark Henninger
All right, thank you, Paul and Stacy. We'll now move on to Q&A, and as is our normal practice, we ask each participant to ask one question and just one follow-up if you have one. Should we please go ahead and introduce our first questioner?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Yes, sir. Our first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
If I look back between the last two years and then heading into what you just guided to for 2013, it seems like your CapEx and your OpEx are outgrowing revenues. I guess, if I partner that together with where the stock is trading valuation wise, it really looks like investors are dubious as to when any returns are going to come from those investments.
So, I guess the question after that is, when do you see the investments come or the return on these investments coming. How long do you think this investment stays last and what are some of the mile markers we should look for to see those returns being generated?
Paul Otellini
Ross, there's two parts to the CapEx this year. I mean, two large parts to the CapEx this year, Ross. One is, you are starting to see in our first significant investments in bricks and mortar and some equipment for the 450-millimeter transition which happens later part of this decade. We have to make to those investments earlier. Now that we've solidified our relationship and contractual relationship with ASML, it gives us line of sight to that conversion and therefore we're now in a better position to predict the exact timing and deploy capital for that, so I would treat that as a more of an extraordinary event that's not related to the day-to-day business in terms of volume in 2014, 2015, 2016.
The CapEx that we are projecting on a base level, $13 billion minus the $2 billion is $11 billion, which is about what we spent last year. And, as I look forward into the business in 2014 and 2015 as we finish up the 14-nanometer factories and begin deployment of the construction of and equipping of the 10-factories, we need those factories principally for our view of the computing market, and in that that would include tablets and certainly the data center. So as we look at it, it gets used.
Remember the leading edge capacity is the lowest cost for us on a per unit basis, the highest performance and the lowest power. So regardless of what you think the size of the market is, the world's leading edge fabs are the single greatest asset that we have.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
I guess, this is my one follow-up, just playing off of that. Is the capacity that you are going to have and I realize the 450 stuff isn’t coming till later but is most of the incremental capacity for your core PC related business? Or when you say computing, is it more DCG and I guess, the word computing could even include tablets and smartphones?
Paul Otellini
Yes, when I am talking about that I was specifically including the enterprise business, the data center business. The PC business, as we have known it and as it's evolving and I would include tablets in that because as we look forward, it's very difficult to distinguish between a detachable, clamshell notebook and a tablet.
The form-factors are going to blur here. The performance requirements are going to be the same spectrum of performance requirements that we think we have seen in the PC space over the last two years. I kept phones separately out of that discussion because I think the relative volume in phones in terms of this deployment of CapEx is still relatively small.
Operator
Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
C.J. Muse - Barclays
Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess this is a follow-up to Ross' question on CapEx. If we exclude that $2 billion on 450 and we look at the core spending, can you talk about the spending on bricks-and-mortar last year and anticipated this year as a percentage and also how we should think about equipment spend as part of that.
Stacy Smith
Sure, Hi, C.J., this is Stacy. I will take that. Let me break out that capacity related CapEx in a couple of different ways. First if you look at it by process, it's very much driven by building for the peak of 14 nanometer and then it's the start of the investment and 10 nanometer. So just building on what Paul said, if you think about that, it's really building for units that we expect in 2014 and 2015 because that’s where you start to see the peak of 14 nanometer and the start of the ramp of the 10.
In terms of the breakout between what's for facilities versus what's for equipment, as I had showed at the investor meeting back in May, we are seeing that the facility related spending is coming back and a higher proportion of that CapEx is for equipment.
C.J. Muse - Barclays
And just as part of that, are you capitalizing investment in ASML or the R&D investment in ASML?
Stacy Smith
No. Now that’s not a capital expense. It was an investment expense.
C.J. Muse - Barclays
Great, and I guess as my follow-up, in terms of the guidance for low single-digit topline growth in '13, can you walk through the underlying assumptions, particularly as it relates to your outlook for PCs and the DCG group?
Stacy Smith
Yes, I said in my prepared remarks, we expect the data center group to return to double-digit revenue growth and diving into that, it's the cloud data center plus our participation in portions of the market like storage and some of the networking sections of the market. It's both unit and ASP based on the strength of our product line and follow-up.
Then for the core PC market, the traditional PC market, we have pretty modest expectations around units and we think where the growth comes from are these devices that sit in the middle. So the convertibles, it's the best of the tablet and the PC and then our beginning of participation across the tablet market.
Operator
Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo. Please go-ahead. Your line is open.
David Wong - Wells Fargo
Thanks very much. The $2 billion for future 450 millimeter production. Is this an ongoing expense? Will you need to put in a similar amount next year?
Stacy Smith
Yes, so as Paul said, what changed over the course of 2013 is the industry consortium around 450triangulated on first equipment to be available in 2015 which is why people are starting to talk about pilot lines in that timeframe. Frankly, a lot of that was enabled by our investment in the ASML allowed the alignment around that timeline. So when we look at 2015 as the time where we can have equipment available, we want to start the production of the big construction of a development facility. That's typically a couple of year cycle and so I would expect some facility related spending next year that’s in the range of what we are spending this year. Then we won't get into the capital related spending for this into the back half of the decade, the production related capital spending into the back half of this decade.
David Wong - Wells Fargo
Great, Thanks. The beginning of the 10-nanometer spending that you'll be doing this year, does that assume immersion lithography or EUV?
Paul Otellini
I think I will save that disclosure for our technologists. We tend to be pretty close to the best with those kinds of things for obvious reasons, David.
David Wong - Wells Fargo
Great, thanks very much.
Operator
Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thanks for taking my question. Paul, there are some reports Intel potentially manufacturing some ASICs for Cisco. My question is not about Cisco per se, but it's really a broader question. Is Intel fundamentally set up from an operational or a financial perspective to become a specialized foundry and what would be some of the financial metrics and the kind of end markets that you would target?
Paul Otellini
My view on this, Vivek, hasn't changed since the Analyst Meeting, Investor Meeting in May, so I can reiterate that for you. We are very interested in being a selective foundry manufacturer for certain customers. We don't see ourselves as a general purpose foundry or competing with the general purpose foundries. The kinds of things we would do, we would not take business that would enable a competitor. We would certainly consider business that would enable and strengthen relationships with strategic partners.
The kinds of things that we've announced so far have been in the programmable logic area, which is an area that Intel is not in today, so that makes perfect sense and those kinds of companies need leading edge technology. So, that's the pattern for which we would do this, so yes, we are in a position to be able to handle those kinds of customers. It's we've been building up that capability for several years now and we are now going into production. I described this I think in May as a crawl, walk, run strategy and we are still in the crawl part of it.
And to the second part of the question around our expectations around return, I mean it's pretty simple. To the extent that we engage with these foundry customers, we want to make money at it. We want to get paid in terms of margin and we want to get a return on our invested capital commensurate with our technology leadership.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you. As my follow-up, we have recently started seeing an increased adoption of ARM's Cortex-A15 processor and I believe earlier today, DSMT spoke about their optimism, but the 20-nanometer process ramping next year at a faster pace than they had ramped 28-nanomer. So, my question is, do you see the competition catching up in terms of performance or in general how should we view the computing landscape? Thank you.
Paul Otellini
No, I don't. Now that we've met the power battery life curves and we are still on 32-nanometers as we move to 22 in 2014, you will see us accelerate. We've looked at the 815, we've looked at the 815 specs and we know our own silicon in terms of Bay Trial and Cover Trail Plus, and we are very comfortable that we can maintain a performance lead there. Micro architecture is hard and it's something we've got 30 years of experience at, and these devices are simply becoming very small computers and that's what Intel is exceptional at.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go head. Your line is open.
Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley
Great, thank you. Just a follow-up on the foundry question. You did say at the Analyst Meeting that you hadn't earmarked any of the capital spending for foundry. Is that still the case when you look at the 2013 spending?
Paul Otellini
Yes. I mean, other than that two or three small customers that you have heard of is not driving our CapEx.
Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley
Okay. Great, and if you talking about getting your historic returns, what does that imply on the price per wafer that you would charge relative to what other foundries charge on an apples-to-apples basis or is that too difficult to think about because you are in process node?
Paul Otellini
Well, I mean, we are pricing real time with customers, so it's not per wafer. Most people are now pricing, the foundries are pricing per die or per millimeter square and that tends to be the model that we would use here to for the most part depending on this level of technology we are talking about. The pricing here is going to be value-based pricing. I mean, obviously it has to be competitive, but the value that we bring in terms of the technology is I think pretty exceptional.
Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley
Great, thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. It sounds to me like you are guiding traditional PCs down a ton this year and yet you seem to making a very big bet on revenue growth in to 2014 because it seems like this flood of CapEx doesn’t really start getting depreciated until then. So how much do you need to take, in terms of share within tablets or how much of that tablet market needs to be eaten up by your convertible PCs in order to fill that big bet in 2014 that you seem to be making and avoid the underutilization that may otherwise happen from the CapEx that you are spending?
Stacy Smith
I take issue with the characterization of guiding PCs down a ton and then some big snap back.
Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein
But you said revenues were up of 2% with data center up in the double digits and phones and tablets ramping, which implies that the core PC business is down.
Stacy Smith
No, so I said for the company its low single-digits in terms of our expected revenue growth, data center up and back into the double digits. You still end up with client growth when you go through that and I think the point that Paul was making earlier was a really important one which was the lines between a traditional notebook, a convertible, a tablet have blurred to the point that it’s a market for computing and we are expecting some unit, now Q1 we think is seasonally down.
That’s what we guided but when we get into the back half and you have a combination of new products in the market and an improving macroeconomic environment I think that’s a fairly reasonable assumption on the year.
As we think, into the future, we think of it as just more or less normal growth, consistent with what we have historically seen, from a unit standpoint. It's just growth across a much wider range of devices than what we have historically supported. You want me to add anything to that?
Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein
Okay, I guess a follow-up on that. My math suggests that you are guiding depreciation this year at $1.7 billion quarterly run-rate, which is flat which suggests to me that your incremental CapEx spending doesn’t actually start getting depreciated on next year, which, again, tells me that you are looking for a fairly solid amount of growth in 2014 to cover that. At the same time, I know you talked about phones and data center and PCs and everything adding to that but the data center business, you sell what, right now 16 million chips a year, something like that which comes from a fab.
You have phones which Paul admitted, we are probably sill going to be small. Then you have tablets where the dies are a lot smaller. So unless you are driving tons and tons of volume, it is actually not a ton away for volume. So what sort of growth, is your historical level of unit growth enough to fill the CapEx you are putting in and what gives you confidence that you can you have that same kind of historical level of unit growth?
Stacy Smith
I think it is and I think that we have line of sight into what our customers are designing around Haswell which is this year's innovative new core product and Broadwell which is next year. So we know the specs on those. The customers know the specs on those. I have seen the prototypes of the industrial designs. They are really exciting products. Our customers have not had this level of performance in this kind of form factor before.
To some extent, we are branch predicting that that level of product will generate sufficient excitement to keep the client growth going. In none of our numbers are we projecting an inflection point, upwards or downwards. We see renewed growth around these new form-factors.
Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein
Got it. You have room to modulate CapEx down?
Mark Henninger
Stacy, we want to make sure we make time for everybody on the call.
Operator
Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Sumit Dhanda with the ISI Group. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group
A couple of questions. One question on what happened in Q4. It seems like your PC client units were down 4%. So third-party data for PCs was up 2% to 3% sequentially depending on the way you look at. Was this mainly an inventory drain and perhaps if you could talk just broadly about the inventory picture at your customers, Paul, as you exited the fourth quarter?
Paul Otellini
Yes, I will take that. We think that there was an inventory drain and a worldwide supply chain for PCs in the fourth quarter. Our channel checks would suggest that a lot of older generation Windows 7 PCs were burned off in the quarter. When we look overall at inventory levels across all the downstream inventory, we think it’s a healthy level of inventory. It looks appropriate for how we see demand and then in terms of our own inventory levels, obviously we reduced them significantly in the fourth quarter.
Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group
Okay, and then for my follow-up, it's on ASPs. They are up, both on the data center and the PC client group. Any particular dynamic at work? I know in the third quarter, data center ASPs are weak because of the mix. If you could shed any light on both of those categories? Thank you.
Paul Otellini
Sure, in the data center, as I said in my comments, the driver was Romley was shipping to the Sandy Bridge for server part. That drove the mix up and it drove the mix to [MP] up and that helped drive the overall richness of the data center business.
On PCs, what we saw was the strength in the core product line principally going into Ultrabooks and laptops and little more weakness than we would have first thought in the bottom of the PC market in our Celeron and Pentium product lines.
Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Glen Yeung with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Glen Yeung - Citi
Thank you. I guess, question for you Paul on the potential for hybrid or even just Ultrabooks in the second half of 2013, and [point] of it, I think we are starting to see a bifurcation where we are selling the small tablets and they seem to be selling well and actually the tenants tablets may be not selling as well as one would have expected and I wonder if that's somehow opening up opportunity for the laptop, the Ultrabook, the hybrid to make a bit of a comeback.
Paul Otellini
Yes. I think coming out of CES, the trends are pretty clear, and certainly in Asia in terms of the buying patterns. Phones are getting bigger and you saw the core tablets, which is a phone tablet sort of form factor emerge which are six, even seven-inch phones. And then, of course, the shift of tablets from 10 to 7 inches, and I think that's probably what you are going to see. That the market will bifurcate between sort of the 5 to 7-inch type of products and the 10-plus inch type of products. And then 10-plus inch type of products, particularly as you get to 12-13 inches are going to be more classic PC level of performance and now enabled by these convertible detachable form factors that only get thinner as Haswell and Broadwell come on.
Glen Yeung - Citi
Interesting, and maybe to follow-up Stacy, just trying to think through the cash balance that Intel is comfortable working with, because it is a lot of spending coming up in a year where it's kind of anemic revenue growth. What's the level of cash at which you feel comfortable and is there any need? I know you raised that recently any need you think to have to do that at some point during the course of the year?
Stacy Smith
Not need, but we would certainly look opportunistically like we have been and we certainly have capacity if we ever wanted to, but I think it's instructive to just look at where we are. If you take Q4, which we would say was a relatively tough quarter at the top line, macroeconomic weakness, the impact of tablets on our business, we generated $6 billion of cash flow from operations, we had $2.5 billion of CapEx, we paid a little over $1 billion in dividends.
So, we are generating plenty of cash to invest in our business and to pay the dividend and protect the dividend. So, I am not worried about it from that standpoint, and as I model out 2013, I get to a similar model where I am generating more cash than I need for those two things.
In terms of the cash balance that I'm comfortable with, I am comfortable with how much cash we have today. I could live with a little bit less also and we make those decisions tactically as we go forward.
Glen Yeung - Citi
Okay, thanks.
Operator
Thank you, sir. Next question in queue comes from the line of Craig Berger with FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Craig Berger - FBR Capital Markets
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my call. I wonder if you could update us on your acquisition Infineon Wireless. It's been almost a couple of years. And specifically, where you are with 4G LTE, where you are with an integrated baseband plus Atom part and when we can expect to see more progress in handsets? Thanks.
Paul Otellini
Well, Infineon is doing well. They are well on their way to an LTE solution. I talked about that in my commentary, but to reiterate what I said was that we are shipping the data mode now, the dual data mode and the voice mode shipping later this year.
First LTE phones, I would expect to have launched early next year, principally around MWC-14. We believe we have a very competitive solution. The Infineon team is known for not necessarily being first to market, but being really good at engineering a very solid solution and being cost effective and cost competitive and I think that they are doing a very good job with respect to this product. In terms of integrated solutions, you'll see higher levels of integration from us next year.
Stacy Smith
Craig, if I could just add to that too? Paul talked about our roadmap side. The thing I'm struck by in this space is how hungry it is that the customers are to work with us in this space. So I think it’s a nice combination. We got a good roll of products across the year and it looks like people are really lining up to have us as one of their key partners.
Craig Berger - FBR Capital Markets
Just following up on this topic of conversation. Any plans to do anything more interesting strategically in terms of putting them in PCs or any plans to develop Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPS, NFC to integrate down the road? Lastly, do you expect growth from Infineon in 2013? Thank you so much.
Paul Otellini
Well, on the middle, all of the above. We have many of those technologies in-house now and are doing levels of integration that makes sense at the right time. In terms of PCs, the problem has not been technical. The problem has been price and most PC manufacturers would prefer, for IP and royalty based reasons, to not build that into their PCs and to have it be either an add-in chip through a slot or add-in service through a dongle.
Stacy Smith
Sorry, we broke off. But I would expect that as the LTE solutions are ramping in the marketplace, we will start to see growth. So I don’t its going to be much in '13 and then it goes from there.
Operator
Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Mark Lipacis - Jefferies
Thanks for taking my question. The question I have is, if you share with us your view on price elasticity in the client PC market in either and aggregate or on the notebook side? I guess what I am wondering is, for the better part of last decade, the model seemed to be you drop your price something on the order of like 5%, 6% a year. You drive like and then that drove 10% to 12% unit growth and you got single-digit revenue growth. Then in '10 and '11, you crushed growth, your prices went up and your unit growth really did not. Now in '12, we have a down year, '13 is low single-digit growth and I am wondering if you think there is elasticity in the market and if you expect to drive your ASPs down in order to drive that elasticity. Thank you.
Stacy Smith
Mark, thank you. I don’t think this price elasticity. There is just much elasticity in the classic form factors. If we wind the tape back earlier than your comments, what we saw was a similar kind of price elasticity the desktop in the 80s and 90s. When PCs broke the $1,000, volume went dramatically up and the desktop PC continued to drop down until it stabilized at the price points where minimum margin was available for all the players. The cheapest desktop was $299 sort of model or something like that.
Notebooks went the same way. First notebooks were $3,000 and now notebooks are $299 to $1,299 in terms of the sweet spot. I think people will buy based upon their need within those price points, but it is very difficult for me to see them going from $299 to $99. The bill of materials just doesn’t support it.
What we are likely to see and what we saw in the fourth quarter, in fact in the Windows 8, touch-enabled models was that people willing to spend a little bit more to get a more capable product. That certainly has been true in the Apple model for many, many years and I think that there is model of getting paid for innovation. Intel's core product line has always shown that. Now you are starting to see it in the system-level price points as well.
Mark Lipacis - Jefferies
Thank you. For a follow-up, if I may. EUV, do you guys have a view on when you can expect to start putting that into the factories? Thanks.
Paul Otellini
Again this is like the emergent question. It's why we keep those things pretty close to our vest. So it's not what I am prepared to talk about.
Operator
Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Romit Shah - Nomura
Thanks a lot. Stacy, if you take the 10-year median for revenue growth, starting in Q2, I only get the slight revenue growth for 2013. So it looks like you are expecting a better than seasonal quarter. Could you talk a little bit about just how the year may play out in terms of trajectory?
Stacy Smith
I don’t think you mean better than seasonal quarter for Q1. I think you mean back half gets stronger that normal seasonality. Is that what you mean?
Romit Shah - Nomura
Right.
Stacy Smith
Yes, and that’s consistent with our view. First and foremost, it comes down to, if you consensus GDP estimates, the consensus today is that there is a pretty significant strengthening in the worldwide economy over the course of the back half of this year.
Over that same ten years, the first correlation of our business is GDP growth. And then beyond that, it's the kinds of things that Paul has been talking about. You have Haswell coming into the marketplace, Windows 8 gaining traction, Touch gaining traction, so you have these great devices that are coming in that are convertibles and kind of the best of the PC and the tablet experience and then we become more and more represented across both, the Windows, tablet section of the market and Android over the course of 2013, and the combination of that puts us into a situation where we believe we have more than seasonal second half.
Romit Shah - Nomura
I'm a little confused on how to think about Q2. It seems like seasonality is changing and the 10-year median is down 1%, but I've noticed just off the last couple of years, Q2 has been actually up anywhere from 1% to 5%. How do you guys look at it?
Stacy Smith
We will talk about Q2 in 90 days.
Mark Henninger
Excuse me. We are going to go ahead and take two more questions if you would please?
Operator
Yes, sir. Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Paul, in 2011, the emerging market was perhaps a better cushion that investors thought for the core PC business. In 2012, it was kind of maybe a bit bigger headwind than people thought coming into the year.
I am kind of curious when you look at the 2013 guide, how you are thinking about emerging market? Was 2012 all just about decelerating GDP, or do you think there was some interplay of some white box tablets starting to cannibalize within that region as well?
Paul Otellini
I think, in particular in China, the market dynamics are not much different at least in the Tier 1, 2, 3 cities. It's different than the U.S. so, yes, there is clearly some tablet sales that impacted low-end or first-time buyer PCs in China.
I think the bigger issue was in China and in Brazil last year, which are the two largest emerging countries, was their overall economic health. Remember, Brazil started seeing inflation that slowed down PC sales. China, the growth dropped and they had a regime change and we saw people stalling around what the policies would be post regime change and so forth.
Now, as we look into 2013, as Stacy said, China is still outgrowing any other large economy in the world and I think will be a driver for PC sales. We've been pleasantly surprised by the data center growth in China. They are deploying fairly large amounts of servers for infrastructure build out and that's helped our overall revenue picture in that country.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
Thanks, Paul. That's helpful. And as a follow-up, Stacy, on the OpEx side, Other IA in the quarter is now annualizing an almost a $2 billion operating loss. As you think about kind of the OpEx, is this now the right run rate for all the new initiatives and how do we think about that Other IA category maybe marching towards a breakeven number as tablets, phones become a bigger part of the revenue stream?
Stacy Smith
Yes. We are not increasing. We're not making incremental investments in 2013. And so, if you look at 2013, we expect employment to be pretty flat, so I think that the answer to your question is, yes, we think we are investing at the right level. We do have an increase in OpEx as we go from 2012 to 2013 and it's just a full year impact of the R&D investments that we talked about in 2012 and that investments are really being driven by Ultrabooks and tablets and phones and our SoC capability as well as our process technology leadership and it's interesting.
I think that when you look at our performance in the business, we've got some great products in the market. I think 2013 will be a year, where we're fighting and hopefully winning some big designs. I think you will see many of those designs coming to the market in the tablets spaces we've talked about and the phone space, the volume will grow over time and we expect that the business grows into this investment level over time.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator
Thank you. And our final question will come from the line of Shawn Webster with Macquarie. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Shawn Webster - Macquarie
Great. Thanks for squeezing me in, guys. First question on gross margins. Looks like they are a little bit better. I was wondering if you could share with us, you said your utilization rates would be below, I think, 50% in Q4. I was wondering if you could share with us where they landed and what you expect the trajectory to be in Q1 and maybe even beyond if you can?
Stacy Smith
Sure. Yes. We came in at a gross margin level a little bit better than expect in the fourth quarter and it played out from a utilization standpoint, pretty much as we expected. We brought the loadings out in the factories significantly. It was below 50%. We redirected equipment to intercept some of the leading edge process technology, and we managed to bring inventory levels down on the order of $600 million which was consistent with what we said.
As we go into Q1, the forecast for gross margin is roughly flat. What you are seeing there in terms of excess capacity is, we will continue to see an improvement in excess capacity and we are going to start to see the increase in startup costs. The rough order of those two things offset and then there are couple of other puts and takes but it ends up with a slight gross margin.
As I think through in the shape for the year, which was the last part of your question, when I get to Q2, I think what happens is we see the further reduction in the excess capacity charges. In fact, they will be pretty much gone in Q2 but Q2 is where we will peak in terms of the startup costs. I think that the startup cost impact is a little bit more than the reduction in the excess capacity. So I expect gross margin in Q2, everything else being equal, to be flat to down.
Then we put 60% out for the year. So you should think about the second half expectations of gross margin back into the low-60s. When I think about the drivers of that, it’s the reduction in startup cost because we peak in Q2 and they start to come down. It increases in volume which would be consistent with the seasonal second half. Then our cost comes down over the course of the back half of this year. Those are the three tail winds that I projected getting back up above 60%.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
Okay, great, thanks. If I might, I have a question on some of the other. If you reload in the low single-digit revenue growth you have for this year, and we throw in the double digits datacenter, we throw in the single-digit growth in PC client, that means the rest of your business must be falling something like 8% year-over-year for calendar '13 and some of these segments like the other IAA group includes some of your growth areas like you have been talking in tablets and smartphones. Can you share with us your build plan, I mean not your build plan but your plan for the year? Or how you are thinking about some of these other groups over the course of the year?
Stacy Smith
First, I don’t get to the same math and so we will just start there. We talked about both the PCCG group and we talked about the data center group but being back in the low double-digits. When we run through the rest of the businesses, we would expect to start to see some progress in tablets over the course of the year. Phones is going to be, we will be winning designs but it is not going to move the needle from a revenue standpoint.
We talked about IMC in terms of the growth returns to that business as LTE ramps which is really in time. We are at the end of this year and in to next year. We expect embedded will see some growth. It's been a nice growth engine for us. We think NAND will grow.
I think I hit them all there. I don’t think I missed anything.

Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Intel Q3 2012 earnings call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
I would now like to introduce your host for today’s conference, Mark Henninger. Please go ahead.
Mark Henninger
Thank you, Patrick and welcome everyone to Intel’s third quarter 2012 earnings conference call. By now you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with it. If you’ve not received both documents, they’re currently available on our investor website intc.com. I am joined today by Paul Otellini, our President and CEO and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we’ll hear brief remarks from both of them, followed by the Q&A.
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today’s discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Also, if during the call, we use any non-GAAP financial measures or references, we’ll post the appropriate reconciliations to our website, intc.com.
With that, let me hand it over to Paul.
Paul Otellini
Thanks, Mark and good afternoon everyone. Our third quarter results came in slightly above our revised guidance as PC related billings improved in September over the July and August levels. We believe that Q3 PC sales grew approximately half of the seasonal norm and reflected flat enterprise sales. The billings upside we saw late in the quarter reflected our customers beginning their system production in advance of the Windows 8 launch later this month.
As we look into Q4, we believe that the overall PC business will grow at about half of what we would expect from normal seasonality. Our revenue forecast growth is below these levels as our customers are taking a cautious inventory approach in the face of market uncertainty and the timing of the Windows 8 launch. Our forecast assumes an incremental decrease in inventory at our customers going into year end.
Our Data Center business saw the Corporate Server segment softening over the course of the quarter, with the Cloud segment growing 50% over last year and storage revenue growing 27% to a new record. During the last month, I have met with all of our major customers and while the market remains tough, I have been encouraged to see a renewed appetite for innovation across the entire ecosystem.
Our customers are designing entirely new categories of PCs that will take advantage of our new microprocessors combined with Microsoft’s new touch enabled Windows 8 operating system to bring dozens of beautiful new tablet, convertible and Ultrabook designs to the market.
In the coming months consumers will see tremendous form factor and industrial design innovation. There will be more than 140 Core based Ultrabooks, more than 40 of which will have touch. This will include more than a dozen convertibles that combine the productivity of the laptop with the convenience of a tablet.
Many of the Ultrabook SKUs will hit the mainstream $699 price point with some Burst SKUs well below even that number. Q4 will see more than 20 Atom based tablets from six or more leading OEMs using Clover Trail. Clover Trail is a brand new SoC that will enable tablets as thin as 8.5 millimeters and as light as 1.5 pounds.
With three weeks of connected standby battery life and all of the compatibility that Windows users and Intel customers have come to expect, I am excited about the these products and the capabilities they bring to consumers and the enterprise.
Last month at IDF, we shared details of our next-generation Core processor codenamed Haswell. Originally targeted at 15 watts, we have made significant advancements in micro-architecture and process technology that will allow us to move Haswell down into the 10 watt envelope fostering even more innovation in form factor as well as new usage models like gesture computing and voice recognition.
We continue to make progress in handhelds with Motorola’s launch of the RAZR i, the world's only two gigahertz smartphone that delivers better battery life than similar computing devices. In general, I see the computing market in a period of transition, but also a period of breakthrough innovation and creativity.
Intel has a history of navigating the industry’s transitions and emerging better and stronger. With the hardware and software roadmap that spans the smallest portable devices to the most powerful datacenter servers and world leading silicon process technology, we are excited about the future and confident in our strategy and prospects in all the markets we serve.
With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.
Stacy Smith
Thanks, Paul. Third quarter revenue came in at $13.5 billion flat from the second quarter and slightly better than our revised expectations. For the fourth quarter of 2012, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range of $13.6 billion, up 1% from the third quarter. This slight increase in revenue in the fourth quarter reflects the caution we are seeing in the order patterns of our customers as a result of concerns about the global environment, ongoing consumer softness in mature markets and a slowing enterprise market segment.
As a result of weaker than expected demand environment, we are taking several actions. We significantly cut factory loadings at the end of the quarter and we will maintain low factory utilization rates throughout the fourth quarter. We expect these factory adjustments to help bring down our total inventory levels by approximately $0.5 billion. Additionally, we are redirecting equipment and space to 14-nanomter from older generation technologies. The result of this is a $1.2 billion decrease from our July forecast for capital spending with the midpoint of our capital spending forecast for the year now at $11.3 billion.
Moving to gross margin; third quarter gross margin of 63% was slightly better than the midpoint of our revised guidance and flat to the second quarter. We are forecasting the midpoint of our fourth quarter gross margin range to be 57%, down 6 points from the third quarter. Two-thirds of the gross margin decline is a result of that excess capacity charges. In addition, we expect an increase in inventory reserves as we start production on our next-generation micro-architecture product codenamed Haswell which we respect to qualify for sale in the first quarter of 2013.
Taking a look at the balance sheet, total cash investments ended the quarter at $10.5 billion, down approximately $3 billion to the second quarter. We generated over $5 billion in cash from operations; paid approximately $1 billion in dividends; repurchased nearly $3 billion in capital assets and had roughly $1 billion of stock repurchases. In addition, we closed our $3 billion strategic equity investment in ASML.
As a result of lower than expected sales in the third quarter inventory grew by approximately $400 million. More than all of the increase in inventories came from the Ivy Bridge product ramp with an offset as we reduced inventory levels of older generation products.
We are taking aggressive tactical actions to reduce inventory levels and redirect space and equipment 14-nanometer and we are also seeing some important positive trends in the markets. In the client space, we are seeing innovative products coming to the market with Intel Inside, ranging from Ultrabooks, to smartphones to tablets.
In the Data Center, we expect to continue to benefit from the dole out of the Cloud and a substantial performance cost and power benefit that our enterprise customers get from our leadership products. Underlying all of this, our manufacturing advantage is extending over the rest of the industry as we start to ramp-up Haswell, our new micro-architecture on 22-nanometer and begin to build-out our 14-nanometer factory network. The combination of the tactical actions we are taking coupled with new products and design wins across all segments and our manufacturing leadership will all benefit our business over the coming quarters.
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.
Mark Henninger

Alright, thank you Paul and Stacy. We’ll now go ahead and move on to the Q&A. As is our normal practice, we’ll ask each participant to ask one question and just one follow-up if you have one. Patrick please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Ambrish Srivastava from BB&T [BMO Capital Markets]. Your line is open.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets
Last I checked, I was from BMO, hi guys. First question is Stacy, just on the startup cost cadence, given that you are moderating the 14-nanometer a little bit. Typically, if I remember correctly, it's a two quarter cadence, how does that play-out this time around?
Stacy Smith
I am not seeing anything that would cause it to be off of historical patterns. So if you look at what’s happened in odd number of years when we started the new process technology, you’ll see a increase in startup costs that hits pretty significantly in Q1, goes up some more in Q2 and then it will start to come down from there. So I am not seeing anything that would cause that to be different from historical patterns.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets
And then my follow-up is on the CapEx Stacy, does that change from what you had given us during the 2012 Analyst Day for 2013?
Stacy Smith

Yeah, we’re not putting out a forecast yet for 2013 CapEx yet; we’re reducing ’12 capital pretty significantly. 2013 will be a function of the unit growth that we see in ’13 and our expectations for ’14. Right now, we want to fight through the Q4 where we don’t have a lot of visibility before we lock in on 2013 number.
Operator
Our next question comes from Doug Freedman from RBC Capital. Your line is open.
Doug Freedman - RBC Capital
Stacy, you gave a number at the Analyst Day regarding full year 2013 gross margin. Can you give us some idea what range you are looking at now that you are taking the actions you are presently communicating today?
Stacy Smith

Yeah, we will provide a forecast for 2013 when we get to January, so again similar to the prior question, I think it’s premature to provide a forecast at this point across revenue or gross margin or CapEx for ’13. We need to fight through Q4 first.
There is a couple of things that I think you can model for ’13 though that are helpful, we've just talked about the startup costs. We are starting up 14-nanometer, so historically that's worth two to three points of gross margin.
In terms of excess capacity charges that we are taking, we are taking a lot in Q4. I think we’ll see that significantly better in Q1 and by then by the time we get to Q2, I don't expect really any excess capacity charges. So yeah, you will see that play out.
And just to size those two things in Q1, I think the excess capacity charges and the startup costs are kind of roughly similar orders of magnitude; so those two things should offset. Beyond that, wait till we get to January because there are just many other moving parts for 2013.
Doug Freedman - RBC Capital
So as my follow-up, on the revenue side we did see some movement this quarter, probably not completely expected, PC Clients a little bit better than maybe you might have expected when you pre-announced. The Data Center, however, though has seen some ASP movement that caused that revenue to be soft. Can you communicate to us what your outlook is as far as the revenue mix for next quarter and maybe what that might do to our gross margin number?
Stacy Smith

Yeah, so just to come back to Q3 for a second and then I’ll answer your question on Q4. What we saw specifically in the Client side, it played out roughly as we thought when we did the preannouncement and if you step back from that, what we saw was some growth in consumption. But our customers continuing to manage inventories very lean, and in fact we saw across the worldwide PC supply chain, we actually saw a reduction in overall inventory levels in Q3, and normally in Q3 you would see an increase, so you can kind of get a sense of how lean they are managing things.
In the Data Center, what we saw was strong growth in the internet IP datacenters, the Cloud, that was up actually 50% from a year ago. It was offset, but we started to see some weakness on enterprise side and that's where you are seeing the lower ASPs just because of the difference in ASP between those two segments.
As we go into Q4, in terms of the overall mix of our business, I’ll direct you to the gross margin recon, there is an issues there with the excess capacity charges. We have some builds on Haswell; really ASP is not impact any gross margin and so you can take from that that we expect it to continue to be kind of similar mix in a roughly benign ASP environment.
Operator
Our next question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
Paul, how do you assess how much of what's going on in the PC market right now; is macro, timing of Windows 8 versus kind of the more structural bearish view that tablets and smartphones are just plain and simple eating into PC TAM. How do you think about those dynamics?
Paul Otellini

I think it's a bit of each and I would be reticent to quantify it John. Clearly, we saw a softening in the consumer segments. We talked about that when we did the pre-announcement about a month ago and the surprise there was that China which had been very strong in those current week on us on top of continuing weakness in the mature markets of U.S. and Western Europe.
However, having said that, we do believe that when the numbers are all in, the PC consumption did grow in Q3 at about half the normal seasonal rate and will also grow in Q4 about half the normal seasonal rate. How much of that happening is macroeconomic versus the timing of the Windows 8 builds and the share of wallet, war for tablets versus PCs is TBD, and we’ll know a lot more about that 90 days from now after the Windows 8 launch, after we see Intel based tablets start shipping, when people start playing with the operating system and have all the touch based Ultrabooks out there. We’ll know a lot more. So we’ll try to quantify that a bit more for you in 90 days, but right now it’s a bit of each.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
And then guys as my follow-up Stacy, I appreciate the fact that it’s too early to talk about next year CapEx, but underutilization in Q4 is clearly helping you kind of lower this year’s CapEx a bit and back in ‘09 off of about half the CapEx base, I think the underutilization is around the credit crisis saved you about $1.5 billion in capital spending. Is this going to hold where as we go into ‘13, the lack of underutilization will allow you to save on CapEx and if you are twice the base then can we think about $3 billion number in total?
Stacy Smith

I am not going to get to that level of granularity. You can see that 2012 capital spending is down $1.2 billion from what we thought a quarter ago. Although, we have some indications that we were trending down a little bit and so you know that’s a big chunk and we’ll talk about ‘13 when we get to January.
Operator
Our next question comes from David Wong from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
David Wong - Wells Fargo
Thanks very much. You commented on Clover Trail tablet; are you seeing many Ivy Bridge tablet designs in addition to the Microsoft Surface and can you give us some idea of how many tablet makers you are currently working with on Haswell tablets for the future?
Paul Otellini
I can help you on the former, not the latter. On Ivy Bridge, you know, there is, I would say, a handful, five to eight, something like that that I’ve seen off the top of my head. And for Haswell, it's too soon to tell, I mean we have, when you start seeing an Ultrabook with a detachable touch screen, is it a tablet and it's based on Haswell, so the tablet is an Ultrabook or is it a convertible, you know, I don't know; lots of inventive names for these things as we go along. What I can tell you is that the level of innovation there is really unbounded; I haven't seen this in a long time.
But, I think in terms of, just little bit near term selling season, there are some Ivy Bridge ones. They tend to be skewed more towards to the enterprise, where our customers believe that their customers, the CIOs of the world want a high performance tablet that is compatible, that is secure and that runs all their enterprise software. So I think that’s where you’ll see those migrate versus I think Clover Trail stuff which was going to be a bit more consumer centric.
David Wong - Wells Fargo
Great. And, you said you expect to qualify Haswell in the March quarter, will Haswell be appearing in systems in the March quarter or should we look for that a bit later in the year?
Paul Otellini

The first half.
Operator
Our next question comes from Christopher Danely from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Christopher Danely - JPMorgan
Thanks guys. So Paul can you just give us maybe just your take on what you think is going to take to pull the PC industry out of this slunk? And do you think that with the advent of tablets cannibalizing notebooks that we’re never going to see the growth in PCs we used to; is it going to be something lower than what we have been used to?
Paul Otellini

Again, since we don’t know how much of the flatness that we’re seeing this year in PCs as a function of which of those variables that we talked about earlier, it’s pretty hard to say that in good economic cycles that we wouldn’t return to normal growth. But, what I get back to as I lookout here, I don’t think and I said this to you guys before, I don’t think that the tablet as we’ve seen it evolve over the last several years is the end state of computing.
The innovation is going to start pouring in now that you have widely available SKUs on a widely distributed operating system that will come from multiple vendors that can unleash their creativity. And, what I can’t predict is what form factor is going to win here, but I do think that some of these things that have sort of the best of both worlds, the performance and the capability of a laptop and the form factor and convenience of a tablet, are likely to be the things that are most high volumes earners, but we honestly won't know for 12 months.
Christopher Danely - JPMorgan
Thanks. And a follow-up question for Stacy, just a clarification on the Q1 gross margins Stacy, so you’ve given us what the utilization rates, underutilization cost look like. If we look at typical seasonality for Q1, you guys are probably down like a $1 billion or something like that. So if sales are down $1 billion and depression is up a little bit and startup costs are up, can the margins be flat with current utilization rates and what would inventory look like?
Stacy Smith
You are trying to back me into a forecast, a few lines and I hear that, I would maybe make a couple of comments though to your thesis. One is, based on what we are seeing in the back-half of this year I am less convinced that normal seasonality is a great guide. What we are seeing is that the customers are managing things very cautiously; depending on how sales go, you know I think yeah, multiple different outcomes for Q1 and we will get there in a quarter.
In terms of inventory levels, we are too high today, because the unit volume that we expected in September didn't materialized, we were under on what we thought from Q4, that’s one of the reasons we’re bringing that the utilization down; lowering inventory levels down significantly in Q4 back into a healthy range and our intent would be to keep them in that range.
Operator
Our next question comes from CJ Muse from Barclays. Your line is open.
CJ Muse - Barclays
Yeah, thank you for taking my question. I guess just as a follow-up on the inventory side. Can you discuss what you have seen downstream particularly in China and then also as part of the healthy days, my math suggest exiting December at roughly 75 days. Is that kind of the new normal we should think about for you guys in a lower PC growth rate environment or do you think that you need to be some thing lower?
Paul Otellini
Let me try the China one CJ, and Stacy will come to the inventory.
Stacy Smith
And I’ll do the second. Yeah.
Paul Otellini
I was just in China a week and a half ago, so there is a fairly current view. I see the same situation. China as a manufacturing center is reflecting the comments that we had in our commentary which is that the OEMs are being very cautious with their inventory comments at this point in time for all the reasons we've discussed and it’s as lean as we've seen it in normal times without the shortage of let’s say their hard drives of last year.
In terms of the channel inventory, there really isn't very much. I went into Tier 3 city, you don’t see things stocked up or sacked up on pallet and stuff. People are generally -- I think most of our customers worldwide spent a lot of Q3 thinning out their Windows 7 inventory, so they wouldn't have an overhang at the launch. And that accounts for a lot of this inventory shipped of our billings versus the consumption that we've been talking about. And now with the launch of Windows 8 coming in a week or so, you'll see a new round of build and hopefully consumption.
Stacy Smith

Yeah and in terms of the inventory targets, the number you threw out is in the 70s is where we're planning to get to in Q4. Just to put that in perspective maybe two other comments on what we're doing. One is we are taking down utilization in the factories down to sub 50%, again to take inventory out and free up the opportunity to move both space and equipment and redirect that to 14-nanometer. So it’s a pretty significant series of actions. And I also want to point to the inventory that we have in place while it’s in terms of units more than I want to hold. It’s on the order of 70% Ivy Bridge, so it’s our freshest stuff. I am not worried about the salability of the inventory, but I do want to bring the Ivy Bridge inventory levels down. It’s just healthy for us to have less.
Operator
Our next question comes from Kevin Cassidy from Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel Nicolaus
And maybe along those lines of the utilization or underutilization, in last year’s Investor Meeting, Andy Bryant had presented and his presentations around the risk of too much capital spending and that Intel had one more fab building that needed what we would do; is this part of that plan; are you mothballing one building?
Stacy Smith

I would say it’s more down the line of my presentation where I showed you that we're constantly trying to match our capacity that's in place to the demand. We are putting in capacity for bigger second half than we got. We are going to now make adjustments, so that we can move capacity to 14-nanometer and bring our inventory levels down.
It doesn’t change the fact that our planning model, we’re always looking to make sure we have the ability in terms of what we call white space to some unallocated factory space as well as some equipment to respond to upsides. The risk of being caught short and the cost of being caught short is much more than the cost of being long, because as you can see when we get a little long, we can take actions and within a six month period, we can get back aligned. If you are sure it can take you two years to get caught back up.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel Nicolaus
And with the reuse of equipment, can you give an idea what percentage that is that can be reused from 22-nanometer to 14-nanometer?
Stacy Smith

It’s not different than our historical pattern. So you could think of it in the range of 80% to 90% of the equipment that we buy and 22-nanometer is usable at the 14-nanometer nodes. And that’s not by accident. It’s one of the things that technologists spend a lot of time to make sure we have these forward reuse paths because it gives us great flexibility to respond to things like we’re seeing today.
Operator
Our next question comes from Daniel Berenbaum from MKM Partners. Your line is open.
Daniel Berenbaum - MKM Partners
When you talk about clearing inventory, does pricing come into play in any fashion on the PC, just talk about pricing a little bit on the Data Center side, clearing inventory on either the consumer side or the enterprise side, is that helping? And then follow-up also a little bit on an earlier question, is there anything else that Intel can be doing to spur demand? We’ve already seen sort of Microsoft take matters a bit into their own hands with some of the designs that they are trying to sell; is pricing help you spur demand or is there something else that you can do?
Paul Otellini

The short answer to your question is no on pricing. We do forward pricing with our customers. It’s priced I think aggressively to move into the mainstream price points in terms of the stuff I talked about. If you look at our PC group numbers quarter-over-quarter, the ASP was about flat year-over-year. It was down a bit, mobile was down a bit. What that reflects was really us going after some incremental share at the bottom of the market, so didn’t really change pricing but it changed the mix, and we thought it was time we could do some of that and we did it opportunistically. That’s more the driver on that side.
In terms of demand stimulation, a lot of what we are doing is really to make sure that the feature set of this season’s Ultrabooks are really consistent with where the market is, that’s why we've been so focused on working with our customers and the ecosystem just, for example, bring the touch SKUs in. So six to eight months ago that we did not have line of sight to 40 out of a 140 SKUs of Ultrabooks being touch enabled, it was probably five or 10; we are up to 40 now, and that’s just going to get bigger as we go into 2013. So working with the vendors and the glass manufacturers to bring the cost of touch as an increment down has been one of the key things we think we can do to drive demand.
Daniel Berenbaum - MKM Partners
And related to pricing, you've obviously got a wounded competitor out there now. Are you seeing that competitor get aggressive on pricing, especially in this environment? Your competitor talked about a big inventory write-down in its negative preannouncement; are you seeing lower pricing there and is that in any way impacting you?
Paul Otellini

I think you would have to ask them their strategy for pricing. As Paul said, we had last quarter and this quarter, we believe, we’ve won some share at the lower end of the market; that's our strategy here. So you’ve got to ask them the question about their pricing strategy.
Operator
Our next question comes from Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs. Your line is opened.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs
Guys, kind of a question stand on the margins. In the context of cyclical history, what we are seeing here isn't too unique from the standpoint of the margins usually decline pretty significantly on the other side of the big CapEx cycles. I think the average margin decline is 700 basis points. The peak is 1,300 basis points. You are down about 1,000 basis points now from the peak gross margins, so pretty normal. Is there anything you see in that context that would cause this margin decline to be worse than some of the more dramatic declines you’ve seen historically?
Stacy Smith

Right; I think that when you go back and look across the long range of history, when we have seen a situation where the industry got a head on capacity, the time that it took to get things realign typically was much longer than two quarters. I think we have done a lot to improve the responsiveness, and I think that has been helpful and you saw that in 2009, but if you go back before that as opposed to a couple of quarters, you are sometimes starting at couple years to get capacity back in line. I think that's different.
And then the other thing I would point to that's different is while the decline is significant and we are taking some excess capacity charges, if you compare what we're going through now with 2009, in 2009 we were into the mid to high 40s; now we're in the mid to high 50s and I think that really points to the structural improvements we made in our business in terms of cost and mix and the competitiveness of our products, and so while it may have seem the same to you but actually I think it’s faster and we are still maintaining a higher gross margin.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs
So my follow-up question stands specific to the Data Center Group, some of the ARM based server players are arguing that they can now address a significant part of the workload from the Google’s and the Amazon’s and Facebook’s data centers. Is that some competitive dynamic that you're seeing in that area or do you think that ARM still isn't competitive in that realm?
Paul Otellini

They need to add features sets like 64-bits and ECC and RAS features to be particularly in those environments to be considered, so that maybe a roadmap planning opportunity that they are pushing but the products that are being shipped today certainly don't have those feature sets.
You can look at some of the workloads, things like Hadoop, Jim that would be conducive to let me say in a ray of micro servers, and those can easily be run on Atom; we've got our second generation of the Atom micro server chips out now, the first one is on 32-nanometers. Now we’re now sampling the 22-nanometer one and what we’ve decided that we are just going to push Atom as hard as possible in this space and have it be a better offering for our customers than having to switch all their software and worry about all the reliability features.
Operator
Our next question comes from JoAnne Feeney from Longbow Research. Your line is open.
JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research
Yeah, I was hoping you can elaborate a little bit more on what you are seeing and what you saw last quarter and what you expect this quarter in terms of the mix of demand, both across consumer and enterprise geographically and then PC, you know, notebooks, desktops; just some more color if you would on what kind of mix you are seeing out there and where you expect it to go and what you’re relying on to get those inventories clear say by the beginning of 2013?
Paul Otellini
Well, let me start with the last part. The inventory, I thing is straight forward. The work-in-process and finished goods that we’re expecting to come down over this quarter are our Ivy Bridge products which is the mainstream high-end product we have today. And as the market picks up, Windows 8 launches, Ultrabooks pick up and so forth then that just consumes that inventory. And as I said earlier, in my comments and Stacy’s, our OEMs are running very lean right now. So any kind of demand blip would cause us to be able to reduce that even more perhaps.
In terms of the mix, there is really not much more to add than we put in our pre-release and in the comments today which is that the U.S. and Western Europe PC markets remained soft in terms of consumers. The change that we have seen and we talked about at the pre-announcement was that the enterprise PC market has gone relatively flat now and I think that’s just a reflection of large corporations making hard decisions on CapEx versus people, and where they want to put their investments and now that seems to have spilled over from the client side of the enterprise also the data center server part of the enterprise. And you know I think we will see how that sorts out over the next quarter or so as CEOs and CIOs make their next round of decisions.
In terms of China, the slowdown there was – it’s principally a notebook business and the slowdown there was in consumer notebooks.
Stacy Smith
And I’ll just add in the DCG, we saw strength in the Cloud customers and over the course of the quarter weakening in the large enterprise purchases of server chips. So the mix there was more towards the Cloud.
Paul Otellini
Mix had been strong in the first half.
Stacy Smith
Mix had been strong in the first half, yeah.
JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research
And then as a follow-up, Stacy could you let us know what happened with units versus ASPs in PCs versus servers last quarter?
Stacy Smith
Yeah, it’s actually in the CFO commentary JoAnne, but in general we saw PC units up 1% versus the prior quarter and datacenter units were also up 1%. This is a quarter-on-quarter compare.
JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research
Sorry, and the ASPs?
Stacy Smith
The PC ASPs were down 1% and the server ASPs were down 7% based on the mix kind of things that I have been talking about.
Operator
Our next question comes from Patrick Wang from Evercore Partners. Your line is open.
Patrick Wang - Evercore Partners
Great, thanks so much. First question, I want to see if we can go back to China and Paul may be kind of recap some of the feedback you are hearing from those meetings you did have, because it seems like the slowdown in China is really impacting global PC demand and weakness out there. So just curious what the latest you are hearing?
Paul Otellini

Well, what I don’t know is how much of this is and China is in their own macroeconomic cycle slowing down, I mean the GDP forecast for the year have come down for next have come down. There is also a reasonable amount of anxiety around the change in government and that tends to put a little bit of nervousness into the system and what I don’t know is how much of that clarifies after they change, because it’s not so much they don’t know who is coming in. The issue is what are the policies, in terms of stimulus and taxation and so forth. They have been pretty generous the last year or so, a year or two rather, in terms of stimulating domestic consumption and the question is will those polices continue or not.
Patrick Wang - Evercore Partners
I want to talk quickly about Data Center. The trend that we’re seeing in ASPs right now are down since the last quarter; I am just kind of curious how you see that over the next couple of years, because when we take a lot at your Cloud segment, you’re forecasting pretty robust growth there. You talked about 50% growth last quarter. As that continues to really outstrip growth from your more traditional server customers, what kind of impact does that do to your blended ASPs?
Paul Otellini

Well, I think the better comparison for us the Data Center is year-on-year, for which the ASP was up a bit, up 1%. The down a bit was really a big shift in the mix between what would be normal enterprise growth and of slowing in the enterprise growth. In general, for storage, for networking and I think for some aspects of the internet data center the mix was actually quite good. Sometimes they – two way machines versus four way machines, but they tend to be fairly high mix and one of the fastest growing elements of the business is high performance computing which buyers buys at the top of the line of our skews. As those product lines get flushed out more and more, I really don't see the mix shifting away from where it’s been in the first half of this year; I see the current mix being a bit of an anomaly as a result of the softness of corporate datacenter server purchases.
Mark Henninger

Thanks Patrick and operator we have time for two more questions.
Operator
Our next question comes from Glen Yeung from Citi. Your line is open.
Glen Yeung - Citi
Stacy, maybe the first question for you. As you sort of think about your capacity for 2013 and you are obviously taking action now, what kind of PC environment are you notionally targeting and maybe just in up or down is sufficient unless you want to be more specific?
Stacy Smith
Yeah, I am going to be less specific. If you wanted the other, yeah either up or down; hold off on triangulating on a capital forecast or on a unit growth until we get to next quarter. The CapEx number as I said is going to be really be dependent on where we think unit growth is in ‘13 and ‘14 and right now we’re fighting through Q4. There is a lack of visibility on the current quarter; I want to have the 90 days to really think about what we want to put in place.
Glen Yeung - Citi
And then Paul maybe next question for you. Notionally, we won’t expect to see when we have an operating transition like we're seeing a spark to PC demand and yet we don't seem to be seeing that and I wonder if you could just give us your thoughts as to why you think this time that’s not happening?
Paul Otellini
Yeah, I don’t think, we know it’s not happening yet. I am very excited about this new operating system. As I said earlier, it brings touch into the mainstream for the first time and we know that in the last couple of years the tablets have changed the paradigm for people to use computers, they like touch, they like to make the photos get larger with their fingers and everything else is good about that. And so I think we haven't had a chance to really judge how the consumers will embrace this in the mainstream PC space or not.
I am very optimistic as we've been playing with these things and we see the products being built and we take them out for testing to consumer and we've now on test on Windows 8, touch enabled Ultrabooks in number of the major cities around the world, across multiple demographics. The feedback is universally positive. So I think we’re just too soon to tell. The designs aren’t even launched yet and we'll know a lot more about this 90 days from now.

Mark Henninger
Patrick, please go ahead and introduce our last questioner.
Operator
Our last question comes from Sumit Dhanda from ISI. Your line is open.
Sumit Dhanda - ISI
Yes hi, two questions. First question for you either Paul or Stacy, you know you noted that inventories are lean and you expect half the normal seasonal growth in PCs, but you're dialing down that number. If the set up is lean from an inventory perspective, why are customers choosing to take down inventories even further or is that just a cushion you are building into your forecast for the fourth quarter?
Stacy Smith

I think it's just caution. We're seeing a very cautious environment there. But I think it's a combination of what they are seeing from macro standpoint and a slowing enterprise and operating system transition and weak consumer mature market segment, I think all of that is just leading people to be cautious. Ultimately, I think leaner inventory levels are healthy, but that's what we're seeing right now.
Sumit Dhanda - ISI
My second question was actually a follow-up on the server ASP stuff that was talked about earlier on the call. I guess my question was I think you talked about the fact that you have twice as many SKUs with Romley with a sort of $1,000 mark from a processor pricing perspective. Has the uptake on the higher SKUs stalled and I guess sort of in line with this question, I was a little confused by why the Cloud mix would be so much poorer versus the enterprise mix, because I would have assumed that the uptake in Cloud would be a richer mix and that would actually help your ASPs relatively (inaudible)?
Paul Otellini

A lot of the cloud is two way versus enterprise at four way. That will add 50,000 (inaudible) that’s the simple answer.
Sumit Dhanda - ISI
Okay. And then the uptake for Romley of sort of above the…
Paul Otellini

Romley has been quite good. All right, thanks everyone for joining us today. Patrick, please go ahead and wrap up the call for us.

Good afternoon, my name is Hope, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I’d like to welcome everyone to the Intel Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)
Thank you, Mr. Mark Henninger, Director of Investor Relations; you may begin your conference.
Mark Henninger
Thank you, Hope, and welcome everyone to Intel’s Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. By now, you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with that. If you’ve not received both documents, they’re currently available on our investor website, intc.com.
I’m joined today by Paul Otellini, our President and CEO; and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we’ll hear brief remarks from both of them, followed by Q&A.
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today’s discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Also, if during this call we use any non-GAAP financial measures or references, we’ll post the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliation to our website, intc.com.
So with that, let me hand it over to Paul.
Paul S. Otellini
Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. Against a backdrop of mixed macro economic trends, our business in the second quarter played out largely as we expected. We continue to enjoy a rich mix of products in both the PC and data center group, and our distributor channel had its best Q2 in five years.
Our Technology and Manufacturing Group once again delivered fantastic results. Our 22-nanometer process health is ahead of where a 32-nanometers was at the same point in its ramp, and ahead of our own plans. That enabled us to ramp Ivy Bridge to nearly a quarter of our PC volume, our fastest ramp ever.
We also announced an important agreement at the ASML last week that we expect, we’ll accelerate the developments and deployment of 450 millimeter and EUV Lithography technologies by up to two years, and deliver significant value to our shareholders.
Ultrabooks continued to build momentum, and achieved our volume goals for the first half. We are very pleased with the level of innovation and invention being brought into this category, and are now tracking over 140 Ivy Bridge base designed in the pipeline. Of those, more than 40 will be touch enabled and a dozen will be convertibles.
With visibility into this many designs, we are very confident that we’ll see $699 systems at retail this fall. We are also tracking more than 20 Windows 8 Tablet designs based on our low power and low cost Clover Trail Atom SoC in addition to a number of core based tablets.
In our data center business, volume growth combined with a rich mix drove record server revenues. In fact, the mix up to our highest performing [Walnut] products was more than two times that of the prior-generation Westmere at the same point in this ramp. DCG grew 15% over the second quarter last year with cloud volume growing at more than twice the rate of the rest of the server market segment. Those figures put the data center on track to the growth targets that we shared with you in May.
High-performance computing continues to be one of the fastest growing segments within our data center business. And earlier this quarter, we announced more technical details behind our new Many Integrated Core Co-Processor throughout later this year. Branded Xeon Phi, this new product family will combine the throughput of highly parallel computing with the familiar programming models of the Intel architecture. Phi will be an impressive product for the HPC market segment with more than 50 cores manufactured on our 22-nanometer Tri-Gate process technology. We already have more than 40 customers bind up to support the architecture.
In the smartphone space, we saw the launch of Medfield-based phones from Lenovo, Lava and Orange to great reviews. These launches further established Intel in the market building on the wide presence we have in baseband.
Overall, our business in the first half was consistent with our expectations. As we look ahead at to the second half of the year, consumer market growth in Western Europe and North America is not forecasted to recover as fast as we had anticipated. Worldwide enterprise demand is growing as expected.
Emerging markets, especially China and Brazil are still growing nicely, but are moderating due to GDP adjustments and currency fluctuations. Taken together, these factors have led us to adjust our expectations for the second half. We are now expecting full-year revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range versus our prior expectation of high single digits.
Our results in the second quarter demonstrates, that having a deep and long established presence in every geography, combined with leading technology, manufacturing and products are important in any environment, but they’re especially valuable in the mixed market we are now experiencing. With the wide range of Ultrabooks and Intel-based tablets expected to be available this year, and an exciting Windows 8 launch just around the corner, we remain optimistic about our future.
With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.
Stacy J. Smith
Thanks, Paul. The second quarter results came in largely as expected. Second quarter revenue came in at $13.5 billion, up 4% year-on-year.
Enterprise in emerging markets contributed to the year-on-year growth somewhat offset by continued weakness in mature markets. The core business came in as expected though we saw softness in our NAND memory business. At the segment level, the PC Group grew 4% from a year-ago and the Data Center Group grew 15%.
Inventory levels across the worldwide PC supply chain are healthy, but are being managed below historical averages based on macroeconomic uncertainty and ahead of the Windows 8 operating system release. For the third quarter of 2012, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range of $14.3 billion, up 6% from the second quarter, which is at the lower end of the historical range.
Moving to gross margin, second quarter gross margin of 63% was slightly better than the midpoint of our guidance and down slightly from the first quarter. Our forecast for 2012 is unchanged at 64% gross margin for the year and our gross margin forecast for the third quarter is 63%.
As expected, the fast ramp of Ivy Bridge resulted in a cost increase in the second quarter. We expect that the second quarter was the peak in terms of platform unit costs with cost coming down in the third quarter and more in the fourth quarter. For the second quarter, spending was in line with expectations with $4.6 billion. Based on the macroeconomic environment, we have taken actions to slow hiring and as a result, by lowering our spending forecast for the year to $18.2 billion. We expect spending in the third and fourth quarters to be flat to the second quarter.
Taking a look at the balance sheet, total cash investments ended the quarter at $13.6 billion approximately flat to the first quarter. We generated approximately $5 billion in cash from operations, paid approximately $1 billion in dividends, purchased nearly $3 billion in capital assets, and had roughly $1 billion of stock repurchases.
Inventory grew by approximately $400 million. More than all of the increase in inventories came from the Ivy Bridge ramp, but then offset as we reduced inventory levels of older generation products.
While macroeconomic weakness and our expectations that our customers will continue to maintain lower inventory levels has lead us to reduce our expectations to 3% to 5% revenue growth for the year. We continue to make great progress in the market. Both Romley and Ivy Bridge ramps are significantly faster than their predecessors. We are winning significant designs in Ultrabooks, phones and tablets. And our manufacturing lead continues to generate leading products and low costs.
With that let me turn it back over to Mark.
Mark Henninger
All right, thank you Paul and Stacy. We’ll now move on to the Q&A and as is our normal practice; we ask each participant to ask one question and a follow-up if you have one. Hope, would you please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Our first question comes from the line of Glen Yeung, Citi.
Glen Yeung – Citigroup Inc.

Thanks very much. I think my first question is about the distributors, I think Paul you said that they had their best future in the five years. Anyone if you could just explains the reasons why that’s the case?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, over the – that’s Q2 in five years. Over the last several years, our distribution channel role has shifted and evolved quite a bit. If you take a snap shot five years ago, most of the business was then distributing desktop microprocessors, and mother boards, and then went into white box builds. And as the PC market shifted from desktops to notebooks they became less of a driver of the PC volume. They picked up skill sets to do systems integration and they’re now among our larger server channels. So the distribution channel has sort of reinvented itself and is now a fairly significant force in not just the desktops, in emerging markets or pre-assembled notebooks, but increasingly for servers and storage systems.
Glen Yeung – Citigroup Inc.

Got it. All right, thanks. And as a follow up, maybe for Stacy, looking at the gross margin guidance and looking at your reconciliation in the printed commentary, it sounded like the only negative impact to gross margins in Q3 would be these other cost of sales, and I wonder if you could just explain what’s going on in there?
Stacy J. Smith
Sure. What’s going on with other cost of sales in Q3 as we are finding some opportunities to take some 32-nanometer capacity offline. They’re relatively small today, but it’s just a result of the lower demand expectations on the year. And so we are taking some of those factories off and so you will see a little bit of demolition costs and some of those things that flows through other cost of sales. And, yeah, it’s not huge, it’s between half a point and a point, but it’s a bit of an offset in gross margin in the third quarter.
Glen Yeung – Citigroup Inc.
It is temporary or does it happen once and then it doesn’t recur?
Stacy J. Smith
Yeah, absolutely. Again, if you’ve seen us do this before Glen, when we have demand coming in less than expected and I actually talked about it in the investor meeting, we look for opportunities to take the older generation capacity offline and because we can reuse that equipment at the leading edge, we just take advantage of those opportunities.
Glen Yeung – Citigroup Inc.
That’s perfect. Thanks Stacy.
Stacy J. Smith
You are welcome.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Sumit Dhanda, ISI Group.
Sumit Dhanda – ISI Group, Inc.
Yes. Hi, guys. First question, Stacy, could you just tell us in terms of your expectations in the channel refill that you talked about on the previous call, are you shipping back to demand levels, the 3% rise in PC Client units reflect that or was that below your expectations? And how exactly you’re thinking about that into the third quarter?
Paul S. Otellini
Yeah. So generally in the second quarter, the core business came in as we expected when we started the quarter, that being slightly below the midpoint was really entirely due to NAND, which I can talk about separately later in the call. In terms of what our expectations are for the inventory pipeline, I think we saw more than in Q2 than we expected. And as we look into the back half of the year, our current expectations that some of you are hearing from customers is, based on macroeconomic uncertainty and the timing of the Windows 8 launch, they’re going to continue to manage inventory levels lean, and that’s a change from where we were a quarter ago in those points, so they’re below seasonal guide for the third quarter.
Sumit Dhanda – ISI Group

Okay. and then as my follow-up, just a question on the – what seems to be a pretty significant dichotomy between notebook volumes and desktop volumes sequentially, especially, given that you said kind of price was decent. so I would have thought desktops might do a little better, but curious to hear what your explanation on that is if any?
Paul S. Otellini
It’s not new. We’ve been seeing robust notebook growth rates now for several years, well in excess of what’s happening in desktop. I’d say notebooks really is a volume story and then in desktops, I think that they’ve done a really good job of driving segmentation. And so, again, even with lower unit growth, they’ve been driving some nice revenue growth but a lot of that is segmentation and ASP uplift.
Sumit Dhanda – ISI Group
Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Berenbaum, MKM Partners.
Daniel Berenbaum – MKM Partners LLC
Thank you. Maybe actually just a follow-up on that, when you talk about segmentation and the ASP uplift that also leads it to the competitive scenario question, obviously, you’re doing a lot better than your primary competitor just based on their recent news. can you talk a little bit about why you think that is with the PC space, you mentioned a little bit that emerging markets are still growing well, do you think it’s competition at the emerging markets or is it more really with the data center, can you help us understand that?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, if I understand their pre-announcements, well, we did a little bit better than them. We thought this quarter was probably in the low-end desktop and notebook business. So we probably took back a little share at the bottom of the PC SKUs, I think our position in the servers is really unchanged and is really quite good.
Daniel Berenbaum – MKM Partners LLC

Okay. And then going back to the inventory question, you talked about the inventory and the channel being a bit low, but your own inventory is quite high. Understand that a lot of this is coming from the ramp of new products, but what gives you the confidence in guiding to relatively high gross margins for the rest of the year, for the full year, are you – what are the puts and takes there and what should we be concerned about or what are you concerned about potentially with that inventory build?
Paul S. Otellini
Yeah. So, let me take those as two separate things. The inventory build is directionally what we expected. I think the one thing that we are able to fill Ivy Bridge a little faster than we thought and Ivy Bridge, it accounts for all of the inventory growth, its both the units and dollars this quarter. And when I look across CPU inventory level, Ivy Bridge is not more than half of the inventory that just sitting in there. As I think about the next quarter, I think it will be pretty flat and we’ll see business level start to grow, and the days of inventory will start coming down from here would be my expectation. With the gross margin story for us really is a cost story and I talked about this last quarter. We have this phenomenon and we’ll ramp in multiple factories at the same time on 22-nanometer. Those early products coming out of the factories are pretty expensive products that led to a peaking cost in Q2.
As we move into Q3, we now have the phenomenon where cost comes down rapidly on Ivy Bridge, but as Paul talked to you about, it’s about a quarter of our volume in Q2. We are going to more or less double that volume in Q3, and so yeah, this phenomenon where cost come down, but the volume doubles, I’ll see some cost good news in Q3, it’s between half a point to a point, and then I get more cost good news in Q4, as that ramp starts to flatten out a bit.
And so, really the thing I mentioned on gross margin is, are we on the path of cost reduction of Ivy Bridge, and on the ramp rate, we’re doing great on the cost, with ramp rates little ahead of forecast, that gives me the confidence, that we’ll see a gross margin in Q4, that’s kind of around 65% and that gets me to 64% for the year.
Daniel Berenbaum – MKM Partners LLC
Okay, great. Thanks very much.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Danely, JPMorgan.
Christopher B. Danely – JP Morgan Chase & Co.
Thanks guys. First question for Paul. Paul, can you just talk about maybe put a little more color around the macro slowdown you are seeing, when it happened, was it just a sudden jump down, has it been a slow erosion, but maybe going to the geos a little bit, which has been more impacted or less impacted?
Paul S. Otellini
Sure. Well, first of all, let me color it by saying that we still see growth in all of these geographies, and we’re forecasting a stronger second half and first half, and gave the year-over-year numbers. What we had expected, that we would see by now is that the U.S. and Western Europe consumer businesses will be recovering from sort of a softness that we’ve seen for several quarters. And as a result of not seeing that, two things are happening: one, we don’t see the PC sales to be as robust as we first thought, but the inventory replenishment coming off of the hard drive shortage is not as deep as we thought or as large as we thought, because people are expecting to sell into a smaller overall TAM growth.
In terms of China and Brazil, which I singled out, but I could have also spoken a little bit about maybe Russia and India. In some of the countries we’re seeing the prices of computers go up as a result of the currency fluctuations against the dollar. Most PC components including ours are sold globally in dollars, and the PCs are typically priced in dollars. So – at least to the distributors in those countries, so the price goes up as the currency changes.
In China, it is a little bit different. And what we’re seeing there is an abatement of the GDP growth and sort of 8.8% in the quarter down to 7.7% in the quarter. And while we still see growth there, we don't see quite as much as we first thought. So we add all those together plus the fact that the enterprise is doing pretty good, you come down to a more muted growth scenario than we first thought.
Christopher Danely – JPMorgan

Thanks. And as my follow-up, it sounds like you’re guiding Q4 to be somewhat back to normal. Is that because you expect Win 8 to drive PC demand or some inventory replenishment or well your tablet and handset efforts start to be material, can you just go into detail on that?
Stacy J. Smith
I think if you take – Chris, if you take the midpoint of our revenue guidance for the year, you’ll come out to Q4 that’s kind of seasonal on the back of the low seasonal Q3. So I'd say, it's a continuation of the trends that we’ve seen. Specifically, to your question, no, it's not predicated on doing more sales in either tablets or in smartphones, but don’t take from that, those aren’t important segments. We think we are on a path to have a lot of products in the market, we’re wining design wins, which really is the momentum that builds into 2013.
Christopher Danely – JPMorgan
So then why Q4 back to normal then?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, we would, we expect that we’re going to leave Q3 with relatively lower inventory levels. You have refresh with Windows, and we have seen over 20 years of history, a pattern in the back half sales tend to larger than front half sales. And so I think it’s a reasonable baseline forecast for us.
Christopher Danely – JPMorgan
Great. Thanks, guys.

Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy, Stifel Nicolaus.
Operator
Kevin?
Paul S. Otellini
I think we may have lost Kevin.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah, Nomura.
Romit Shah – Nomura Equity Research
Thanks. There have been reports over the last month or so that Intel has been cutting prices on Ivy Bridge, I was hoping you could just comment on that. Is it true? What’s behind it?
Paul S. Otellini
No. Our pricing strategy is unchanged and Ivy Bridge is coming in at the top of the scale. What those reports may – I haven’t seen the reports, Romit, but they may be just pointing to the fact that, we’re filling in more price points with Ivy Bridge, but we have not reduced our price points.
Stacy J. Smith

As Paul said, by the way, the place where we probably won some share and where we are seeing kind of robust pricing as more at the very lower end of PC market is not where Ivy Bridge is pointing.
Romit Shah – Nomura Equity Research
Okay. That’s helpful. And then Stacy, in your gross margin guidance for Q3, you highlight lower platform ASPs, could you give us some color there?
Stacy J. Smith
Yeah. And we realized that we’re talking kind of half a point to a point, relatively small changes. But in the third quarter, there’s a couple of things that has caused me for that forecast though. First, Q3 tends to be a larger consumer quarter, where you see a little bit of a mix impact associated with that, again, not changing our price point is just a mix of what we think sells through in the third quarter.
And then the second thing is, well, I was just talking about, we think we’re probably gaining some share at the low-end of the market, we’d expect that to continue into the third quarter, but fairly muted impact. So all of this is in the context of what I articulated at the beginning of the year of a pretty benign pricing environment, I hadn’t seen anything that causes me to change that view.
Romit Shah – Nomura Equity Research

All right. Thank you.
Stacy J. Smith

Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer, Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse

Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations. Stacy, you guys are kind of controlling OpEx relative to the slightly weaker than expected demand environment. You’ve also talked about kind of doing what you did back in the financial crisis as moving some spare capacity forward. But you haven’t changed the overall CapEx number for the year. Is that because this is predominantly brick and mortar, and does that give you more flexibility on next year’s CapEx, if you can just help me understand that dynamic?
Stacy J. Smith

Well, what we’re spending CapEx on this year is really kind of building that 22-nanometer ramp, but it’s not key 22-nanometer, and that capital is appropriate to invest really in any economic climate. So the change in the demand environment hasn’t changed our view of at least to the 22-nanometer capital we’re putting in place today.
That said, as I said earlier, we are seeing some opportunities to take some older generation capacity offline and roll forward. My guess is, as we work through those we’ll end up at the lower end of the range on CapEx. We’re just – we’re looking through those opportunities as we speak, and I think we’ll come down a bit from here.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse
And then Paul, relative to the Win 8 launch, Microsoft did now come out and decided they want to be a tablet company with the Surface products, and it sounds like their intent is not to use that as a Reference Design for other OEMs to follow, but actually try to make a real business out of that. What kind of impact do you think that might have on the traditional PC business, if any?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, I think you again have to ask our customers that question. From our perspective, I guess we’re certainly happy to have them as another hardware customer. We haven’t sold chips to them for quite some time since the Xbox days. But in terms of the ecosystem, I don’t know that, we know their plans deeply enough in terms of this, flagships skew or they tend to have broader designs on the market, I don’t know, until. I think that question has to go to them and to our customers.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse

Thanks for taking my question. First, your PC client ASPs are staying within the benign range that I think you have mentioned multiple times. I’m curious, is there some scope of benefit from becoming a little more aggressive on pricing to stimulate demand or is this a very price inelastic market? Then where I’m going with that is on the Ultrabook side, but it has to be somewhat more aggressive because you do have cost leadership and flexibility?
Paul S. Otellini
I don’t think so. I think that the value associated with the Ultrabooks, they start with the core product line, the Core i3, 5 and 7s is still pretty good, and I commented in my statement that I think that we’re quite sure that the prices are going to be $699 and in the sweet spot. If there was that kind of elasticity, which we have not seen then I would expect some of the thin and light designs around the Pentium and Celeron chips that we sell, we’d pick up some of that volume and we don’t see that today. What we are seeing is that in the time of tight consumer budgets people buy quality and they tend to buy the high-end of the line or reasonably high-end of our product lines.
So it’s not going to last, if you want something to last a few years that that tends to give them a bit more of assurance. And I’d also say the other thing that I haven’t come up yet is, the Win 7 to Win 8 transition. And as we have done in the past in terms of working with Microsoft, the units that are shipped now in the marketplace are Win 8 ready. And they have programs, incentive programs to be able to buy the upgrade with the coupon at a discount.
Vivek Arya – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch
All right. Thanks, Paul. And for my follow-up, I think you had mentioned consumer weakness in the mature markets mostly due to macro, but I’m wondering what role are tablets playing in that and how soon can we look to Clover Trail based tablets to somehow help reserve back the trend? Thank you.
Paul S. Otellini
Yeah. Well, certainly over the last couple of years as tablet volumes have ramped up, they do present and have presented an alternative for consumer share of wallet, particularly at the time when consumer share of wallet is tighter than it has been in the past. And our thesis really hasn’t changed here, which is that that these are incremental machines for the most part, people still have primary computers in the likes most people do, much like they did that we saw when the netbooks ramped up several years ago. As Intel based tablets are shipping both on Windows 8 and Android, we expect to be able to participate in that fast growing market, but I don’t think those numbers are going to be material this year. I think that just because of the start on, the timing of the start is going to be a slower ramp, and Stacy really addressed it earlier in his comment on phones and tablets.
Vivek Arya – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch
All right. I’m just wondering why [video amp] camp has been so much more aggressive after that Windows 8 tablet market and why Microsoft did not launch a Clover Trail based or did not announce a Clover Trail based tablet? It’s just a difference of timing or…?
Paul S. Otellini	

I think you need to – they talked about core-based machines more like an Ultrabook, those convertible kind of machine, which I think is actually a pretty good machine. And, so no compromise device. So my term is when I go shopping that’s the device, I’d buy.
Stacy J. Smith
And you will see Clover Trail tablets time to market where…
Paul S. Otellini
Yeah, at launch.
Stacy J. Smith

At launch. So I think it’s just a choice that Microsoft made in terms of their read to the market at a higher performance, more like an Ultrabook device is what they wanted to lead with.
Vivek Arya – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch
Okay. Thank you.
Paul S. Otellini

Your next question comes from Vijay Rakesh, Sterne, Agee.
Vijay Rakesh – Sterne, Agee & Leach

Guys, thanks. I was just wondering when you look at the inventory side, obviously came up and you mentioned this Ivy Bridge. How much of it was (inaudible)?
Stacy J. Smith

I think you mean units or costs right?
Vijay Rakesh – Sterne, Agee & Leach
Yeah. How much of it was, if you could break it out, the pick up between unit versus pricing?
Paul S. Otellini
Yeah, I think last quarter I said that unit growth was relatively muted and that was really cost. This quarter where its units primarily I mean and cost is secondary. So about to get that level of granularity, but you should kind of visualize it as we are – our inventories we are reducing units on older generation products and we are refilling our inventory pipeline with Ivy Bridges. It’s primarily units of Ivy Bridge and then those units are a little bit more expensive still than the Sandy Bridge parts that they’re replacing.
Vijay Rakesh – Sterne, Agee & Leach
Got it. And one last question is on the Ultrabook side and you mentioned you expect pricing to go to 699. What are the dollars you see there, because of SSD pricing, NAND pricing has gone starting to extrapolate that to red zone?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, NAND pricing is not been stable, coming to some of the reasons we didn’t hit the midpoint this quarter, it was the reason. And what we're seeing those is, there’s a variety of SKUs that our customers are designing, I talked about over 140 designs, some of them are aiming at a premium segment and higher prices using SSDs. Some of them are using these ultra low-profile very high capacity drives, which are now becoming available, which gives you the capacity and the thinness at the same time, which I think it’s a nice way to hit lower price points.
Vijay Rakesh – Sterne, Agee & Leach
Got it. Thanks a lot.

Your next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann, Raymond James.
Hans Mosesmann – Raymond James
Paul, couple of questions on Windows 8. How much of the guide in Q3 is due to this potential air pocket in front of Windows 8, and how do you see Windows 8 next year in terms of traditional, historical operating system cycles? Thanks.
Paul S. Otellini
I don't know how much of the – was – for the air pocket is Windows 8 versus the macro economics, in fact it’s very hard for us to distinguish that today. Given that if we have not seen stalls before, because we’re shipping chips in to our customers in advance of the operating system being loaded. But having said that, since the last Windows release, we've moved to more of a hub model with our chips, so that means people can draw these bit more just in time. So that maybe some of the air pocket that we’re seeing, to use your phrase in Q3, but I think that gets filled up pretty quickly in Q4, and it’s – as I said earlier, a lot of people buy the Win 7 machines with the coupon and then upgrade?
Hans Mosesmann – Raymond James
Okay. And then, for next year?
Paul S. Otellini

To some extent – my sense is that you’ll see a very rapid adoption in consumer as you’ve seen before, and an enterprise will convert, you’d typically be starting with the first equivalent with the service pack release hereafter their fall cycles were done, so it tends to like initial deployment, tends to like six months or so.
Hans Mosesmann – Raymond James
Great, thank you.
Stacy J. Smith
Thanks Hans. And Hope, I think we have time for two more callers.

Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello, Goldman Sachs.
James Covello – Goldman Sachs
Thanks so much for taking the question, I appreciate it. Somewhat related to John Pitzer's question, Stacy, you have presented some slides at the Analyst Meeting, that I think you said kind of hold on tax, what if our view on unit growth changes, and then you presented a very helpful responsiveness case study. Is what you described to John relative to ramping down some older products and fabs and putting newer products in that and being at the low end of CapEx, is that the responsiveness case study or would that be another step altogether?
Stacy J. Smith
No. it all falls under that general category of responding to changes in the demand environment. We're kind of constantly looking at demand. Now we realized, we are – CapEx, it’s more important as we figure out what, ‘13 and ‘14 demand looks like. But yeah, as we see opportunities to take 32-nanometer capacity offline, and roll it forward, then it offsets capital that we would have had to buy for 22-nanometer. The case study I shared was one where you see a dramatic shift in demand levels that happens as a result of a financial crisis that takes everything down in a very faster rate of time. This is one where our expectations are just moderating. and so we’re finding some incremental opportunities to start to react that way.
James Covello – Goldman Sachs
And so I guess as my follow-up, I mean what do you think about factory loadings or utilization as you go through the third quarter as your outlook for the year changes and some of capacity from the previously spent CapEx kind of ramps up, you think the factory loadings will remain at high level utilization stays at the same level or do you begin to bring that down some?
Stacy J. Smith
At 22-nanometer, so the process what we’re doing, Ivy Bridge, that will stay full. We see the demand signals continue to be strong and we’re going through the inventory replenishment to get the production stuff in the inventory. We have seen loadings come down some in 32-nanometer, not to the point that we’re taking underload charges, but to the point that we can start to take a little bit of that capacity offline. And as I said to John’s question, if I have the brands to predict, I think we’ll find more of those opportunities over the course of the back half of this year.
James Covello – Goldman Sachs
Thank you very much.
Stacy J. Smith
You’re welcome.
Paul S. Otellini
Thanks, Jim.

Your final question comes from the line of Craig Ellis, Caris & Company.
Craig Ellis – Caris & Company
Thanks for taking the question. Paul, just back on Ultrabook topic, as you look to end of the back half of the year, how do you see the Ultrabook mix shaking out as a percent of notebooks, I think in the past, you’ve referenced a 40% of consumer notebooks by the end of this year. is that still a reasonable number or how are you looking at that?
Paul S. Otellini
Yes, it is. We really haven’t changed our view on that. a couple of things give us confidence there. One is, first half shipments on Ultrabooks were essentially right on our expectation set over six months ago. And the design pipeline for what we see in the second half, and the price points that we see, we think will get as there. In a softer selling season, I think these machines become even more attractive. And so, I'm fairly confident, we’ll hit our volume goals of this in terms of percent mix for the consumer notebooks.
Craig Ellis – Caris & Company
(Inaudible) and then switching gears, Stacy you have mentioned in earlier commentary, you’ve come back to the NAND business, I don't think, I heard you do that, so I'd just not give you an opportunity to make any comment that you might have?
Stacy J. Smith
Yeah, I was assuming someone is going to ask me the question. Yeah, we saw NAND soften in Q2, we saw on our commentary and as Paul alluded too, I don't think its just as, I think you're seeing that from other company, it led to us being a little lower in revenue, I think that continues as part of the lowering of expectations into the back half, you know there is a chunk of that, that’s NAND related.
I want to contrast it, it's really different compared to the last downturn we went to, which I think it was about four years ago, you can really see the impact of the strategy that we've been pursuing in that business. The fact that we now have process technology leadership, and we've transitioned all of our shipments to higher margin segments of the NAND market, like SSDs and compute NAND. So that even though while it’s impacting us at the top line, it’s a business that still is generating positive profit, and its still generating positive cash flow. As a fairly new CFO, the last big downturn hit NAND and it was quite different, because we didn't have that cost leadership. And we were shipping into the commodity segments of the business. So, I think it's a real testament to what they have accomplished in the business, but it's definitely soft.
Craig Ellis – Caris & Company
And nice going with that business. And thanks very much for answering the questions guys.
Stacy J. Smith
Thanks.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Quarter 1 2012 Intel Corporation Earnings Conference Call. My name is Misty, and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Mark Henninger, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Mark Henninger 
Thank you, Misty, and welcome, everyone, to Intel's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. By now, you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with that. If you've not received both documents, they're currently available on our investor website, intc.com. I'm joined today by Paul Otellini, our President and CEO; and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them, followed by Q&A. A brief reminder that we'll be hosting our Annual Investor Day at our headquarters in Santa Clara on Thursday, May 10, and we look forward to seeing many of you there.
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and, as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Also, if during this call we use any non-GAAP financial measures or references, we'll post the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliation to our website, intc.com.
So with that, let me hand it over to Paul.
Paul S. Otellini
Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. The first quarter played out much as we expected, with ongoing strong demand in emerging markets and in the enterprise being offset by continuing softness in the mature market consumer segments. PC consumption in the BRIC countries experienced solid double-digit growth over the first quarter of the year -- of last year. In addition, we see continued momentum in IP Data Center solutions, from servers to networking to storage, across both mature and emerging markets.
Our commitment to long-term research and development is paying off. We are beginning a year of major product and technology transitions that will have a very positive impact on our company and the industry. I'd like to highlight a few examples. We are ramping our 22-nanometer manufacturing process into high volume. This revolutionary technology uses our third-generation, high-k metal gate and the industry's first 3D Tri-Gate Transistors.
The move to Tri-Gate Transistors delivers roughly twice the improvement in transistor performance over conventional planar scaling when applied to low-power applications like smartphones and Ultrabooks. We combine our process technology, manufacturing and design to produce a highly leveraged business model that is becoming increasingly rare in our industry. That model allows us to do things others can't, like advancing our Atom roadmap at twice the rate of Moore's Law through 2014.
We're doing this at a time when the rest of the industry is struggling to ramp older technologies that lag our prior-generation, 32-nanometer process. Our research on 3D transistors began over 10 years ago, and advancements like this don't come easily. In fact, they're getting harder and harder to achieve, and our lead over the rest of the industry continues to grow, giving us product advantages in power, performance and cost.
Ultrabooks are reinventing computing with new form factors, high performance, better battery life, advanced security and other exciting new features. With more than 21 designs already shipping and more than 100 designs in the pipeline for 2012, we're very pleased with our progress. And yet, this is just the beginning. Earlier this month, we launched our largest advertising campaign in a decade. And over the next few months, we expect Ultrabooks to reach mainstream price points. By the holiday season, we expect the touch interfaces and innovative new hybrid designs will combine the convenience of a tablet with the performance and productivity of a notebook for truly no-compromise devices and experiences.
Global trends in data centers also continue to look favorable. We expect that by 2015, IP traffic will triple and data storage needs will grow by about 50%. This isn't just a mature market phenomenon. Data centers in China have grown at 8x the worldwide average over the last 5 years, making it the second-largest server market in the world.
The Xeon E5 processor, code-named Romley, was engineered with exactly these trends in mind, improving performance up to 80% and performance per watt more than 50% over the prior generation. One month after launch, Romley has shipped nearly twice the volume of Nehalem at the same point in its ramp.
At IDF Beijing last week, we also provided details about our upcoming Atom-based microserver System on Chip, code-named Centerton. Centerton will launch in the second half of the year with 2 cores, 64-bit capability, ECC and virtualization technology, all in a 6-watt power envelope delivering outstanding performance and power efficiency with unmatched software compatibility.
This quarter, we made significant progress in smartphones as well. Following our announcements with Lenovo and Motorola at CES, we followed on at Mobile World Congress with announced designs with Orange, ZTE and Lava, as well as a strategic partnership with Visa for mobile payments.
And finally, McAfee posted its best first quarter bookings in the company's history. McAfee's Deep Defender security product, the first fruit of McAfee and Intel's collaboration, also successfully blocked the day-0 Cridex worm attack, missed by many other antivirus systems, demonstrating the value of our hardware plus software security strategy.
Looking ahead, our expectations for 2012 remain unchanged, and Q2 will bring several exciting announcements. We've already begun high-volume shipment of Ivy Bridge products, and you will soon see system availability. Ivy Bridge will be our fastest ramping product ever, comprising nearly 1/4 of our microprocessor volume in Q2 alone and crossing over 50% of our microprocessor shipments this fall. And we expect to see another important milestone for our business later this week with the launch of the world's first Intel architecture-based smartphone.
Q1 was a solid quarter, and it provides a great step up -- setup for the year of important transitions built on a foundation of growing process technology leadership and the performance, compatibility and power efficiency of Intel architecture.
With that, let me turn the meeting over to Stacy.
Stacy J. Smith
Thanks, Paul. The first quarter results came in slightly better than our expectations. From a revenue standpoint, the first quarter came in at $12.9 billion, slightly better than expected. Similar to the fourth quarter, our business was negatively impacted by hard disk drive shortages and the resulting additional reduction of inventories across the supply chain.  Despite this discontinued reduction in inventory levels, it is our belief that the shortage did not impact actual sales of personal computers in the first quarter, with demand trends playing out as expected. Our expectation of high single-digit revenue growth for 2012 is unchanged.
For the second quarter of 2012, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $13.6 billion, up 5% from the first quarter and a return to year-on-year growth. This is better than the average seasonal decline of down 1%, as we see the beginning of the refilling of the PC supply chain as hard disk drive shipments recover.
Moving to gross margin. First quarter gross margin of 64% was slightly better than the midpoint of our guidance and down slightly from the fourth quarter. Our forecast for 2012 was unchanged at 64% gross margin for the year, and our gross margin forecast for the second quarter is 62%. As we move into the second quarter, we will be ramping up our Ivy Bridge production in 3 new 22-nanometer factories, resulting in an increase in unit costs.
As we progress through the year, we expect unit costs to come quickly down the cost curve, resulting in second-half gross margins improving from the first half.
For the first quarter, spending was in line with expectations at $4.4 billion. We are maintaining our spending forecast for the year at $18.3 billion. As we move into the second quarter, we are forecasting a $200 million increase to spending when compared to the first quarter, primarily driven by the start of our Ultrabook marketing campaign. We expect spending as a percent of revenue to come down in the second half.
Taking a look at the balance sheet, total cash investments ended the quarter at $13.8 billion, down $1.1 billion from the fourth quarter. We generated approximately $3 billion in cash from operations, paid approximately $1 billion in dividends, purchased nearly $3 billion in capital assets and had $1.5 billion of stock repurchases.
Inventory grew by approximately $400 million, with more than all of our growth attributed to our ramp of Ivy Bridge. On a unit basis, our microprocessor inventory went down from the fourth quarter.
Our first quarter results and our forecast for the second quarter are consistent with our expectations at the start of the year and reinforce our expectations for 2012. Against the backdrop of the worldwide shortage of hard disk drives and continued macroeconomic weakness in the mature markets, our execution remains strong.
We are in the midst of an unprecedented refresh of our product line across segments of our business. Both Romley and Ivy Bridge ramp rates will be significantly faster than their predecessors. Our manufacturing lead continues to extend with 3 new 22-nanometer factories ramping in the second quarter and a fourth factory ramping in the second half. Additionally, we are winning designs in embedded smartphones and tablets that will add to our growth rate over the long term. We are making investments in our business which bring us competitive advantage, and we are using the cash flow we are generating to increase shareholder returns. We will talk more about all of these trends at our next month's investor meeting. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.
Mark Henninger 
All right. Thank you, Paul and Stacy. We'll now move to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Now Misty, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Stacy, just a follow-on to the gross margin in Q2. It sounds like the entire hit is just the ramp of the Ivy Bridge. I just want to get a little bit of understanding. Was this an unexpected unit cost uptick? Or is there something different going on with the yield curve with Ivy Bridge at 22 than you had anticipated?
Stacy J. Smith
No, it's absolutely consistent with my expectations when I started the year. Maybe it's worthwhile. It's been 2 years since we've gone through a process transition; that was the 32-nanometer transition. So let me just take a second to go through a tutorial on how the cost accounting works as we go through one of these. We have 3 new 22 nanometer factories. And at the beginning of that ramp, the first units that go through those factories in essence absorbs all of the cost of those factories. So that is, by far, the most expensive part of the ramp. Those are the products that are today sitting in inventory. And as we ramp up sales in Q2, those will be the products that we sell-through. And so the result of that from a cost accounting standpoint is we'll have a peak in unit cost in the second quarter, and then we come down nicely in Q3 and nicely again into Q4 as those factories ramp. And as I said, it's consistent with what I thought at the beginning of the year, and it's consistent with what we saw with 32 nanometer. If you go back and look at the same quarter, you'll see that same peak in unit cost. The difference there was it was 2 factories and today it's 3 factories because of the speed at which we're ramping Ivy Bridge.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
And then guys, as my follow-up, Paul, just recognizing that sometimes things don't happen nicely within a 4-quarter period, you guys have talked about DCG -- that DCG would be about a 15% long-term growth CAGR on top line. To achieve that this year, given the March quarter run rate, it kind of implies a pretty healthy ramp to about $3 billion a quarter for the next 3 quarters. Is that kind of how we should expect the Romley ramp to play out? Or if you can give us some guidance around that, that'd be helpful.
Paul S. Otellini
I'll give you a little color around it, then I'll let Stacy handle the CAGRs and the dollars per quarter. We went into very high volume production on the enterprise version of Romley, which is the EP version in March, and that was the data point I gave you in terms of 2x the volume of Nehalem. In anticipation of that, I think there was a bit of a lull on Nehalem shipments in the first part of Q1 from our customers as they knew this transition was coming. So that was really part of the profile of the quarter. And particularly, if you look year-over-year, remember last year, we had some large deliveries of products to some Internet data center customers that -- I think Stacy described that as being very lumpy in terms of their demand. And that's Q1 of last year, as well as the 14th week. So when you adjust for those factors, I really don't see anything on our Data Center business that puts us off-track from the numbers that we committed to in terms of the 15% CAGR. And yes, we do expect double-digit growth in the second half of the year for this product line.
Stacy J. Smith
Yes. Actually, I'd just add to that. I would expect the Data Center Group -- I think Paul did a really nice job of describing the Q1 compare. As I think about Q2, we would expect the Data Center Group to get back to double-digit growth. And then as we move into the back half of this year, it's growth rates that are at or above the historical average. So it's -- it's expected to grow, and we're still committed to the goals that we talked about last May of doubling the business over the next 5 years. And the trends that are driving it are still intact.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Stanford Bernstein.
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
I had a question on the impact of hard drives and seasonality. So you obviously got hit by it in Q1. You're seeing a bit of a snapback in Q2. You said you're not -- in your CFO commentary, you said you weren't forecasting any more negative impact. But is a possible -- is a positive impact possible? Have we seen all the snapback you think that we're going to see from the hard drives coming back? Or is there potential for further-above seasonal growth coming in the back half? How should we think about overall seasonality in the wake of the hard drive situation through the rest of the year?
Stacy J. Smith
Yes, great question. Thanks. This is Stacy. And actually, I'd characterize Q2 as being -- our forecast is pretty consistent with underlying demand, and that I think the inventory replenishment really kicks in as we get into Q3. So let me kind of talk through what I think hard disk drives have done to the shipment of PCs. Q4 was obviously impacted significantly as the impact of the Thailand floods reduced the amount of hard disk drives out there. And as we said on the January call, people weren't buying processors because they couldn't marry that with a hard disk drive and make the system. And so we saw a significant reduction of inventory levels. I think that reduction actually continued into Q1. So we saw further reduction of the worldwide supply chain. What you see in Q2, I believe, is pretty indicative of in-demand, just the fact that you have a Q1 that's depressed because of that contraction in the supply chain. And then what I think happens in Q3 is that's where you're going to really start to see the replenishment of the worldwide supply chain for PCs, and it's a combination of: they're going to replenish the supply chain with Ivy Bridge as opposed to doing it with older-generation technology, and it's anticipation of a good Q4. We have lots of catalysts in the marketplace that we think are driving a reasonable amount of excitement for how sales could go at the end of this year.
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
Got it, that's helpful. And for my follow-up, another question, I guess, on gross margins. So this quarter, gross margins came in a little bit better than expected, and it looked like it was because your platform unit costs were better than expected. Next quarter, on at least versus where the Street was, it looks like gross margin is coming a little worse, and it looks like it's probably because of higher-than-expected gross margins -- higher-than-expected platform and unit costs. I know there have been some fluff floating around of push outs on Ivy Bridge. Is this -- should we take this as, I guess, some sort of evidence that the initial ramp of Ivy Bridge actually did see a bit of a push up from Q1 into Q2? I mean, how did that ramp versus what's going now compare with your original expectations as in back in January when you gave the gross margin guidance for the quarter?
Stacy J. Smith
Yes. If you remember during the quarter, we were pretty public that we shifted the ramp of Ivy Bridge out 3 weeks. That was to make sure that there was enough inventory in the pipeline...
Paul S. Otellini
Shifted the launch out.
Stacy J. Smith
I'm sorry. We shifted the launch of Ivy Bridge out 3 weeks, yes. And so what that means is we sold through a little less Ivy Bridge in Q1. Those products were in inventory. And then that's the Q2 impact that I talked to you on cost. So Ivy Bridge really explains the little bit of good news in Q1 and then the Q2 gross margin forecast. And again, that Q2 margin forecast is consistent with what I thought when I started the year. It's just Q1 was a little better.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Shawn Webster with Macquarie.
Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research
I was wondering if you could help us understand some of the moving parts within desktop and notebook for the quarter and what your expeditions are going into Q2.
Stacy J. Smith
The -- yes, we don't forecast at that level of granularity. But what we're seeing -- and remember, we're comparing to a 14-week quarter back in Q1 of '11. But in general when you step back and look at what's happening in the different businesses, what we see is that the notebook segment of the market continues to grow nicely on a unit basis. Emerging markets continues to grow, and that tends to be a bit more desktop-centric. Enterprise was relatively strong and then we saw some weakness in mature-market consumer. Those kind of play through the different segments. But if your question is are we continuing to see notebook market growth, we did in Q1 when you look at the actual demand for computers relative to where we were a year ago and relative to what you'd expect seasonally.
Paul S. Otellini
I would add on top of that, that the first versions of Ivy Bridge that we're shipping are quad cores, and then bulk of those are going into desktops. And there's a lot of interest in these new generation, all-in-one desktop. If you haven't seen them, they're pretty attractive machines. And then the second launch of the products is in the dual core, which is the mainstream notebooks. So I think that helps put a profile over the course of quarter as well.
Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research
And then I guess as a segue from the mix perspective and the pricing, pricing was roughly flat for you guys in Q1. Do you expect it to remain kind of flattish over the course of the year? Or are there some things happening in terms of your ramps that you're expecting more pricing could actually maybe increase over the next quarter or 2?
Stacy J. Smith
No. I characterize the pricing environment in January as -- I think the word is ""relatively benign,"" based on the process technology leadership we have and the strength of our products relative to competition. I haven't seen anything that would cause me to change my view. I think 2012 will be a relatively benign pricing environment for us.

Your next question comes from the line of Uche Orji with UBS.
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Paul, can I just ask you a 2-part question on the Ultrabooks? You talked about being able to achieve mainstream pricing in a few months. Can you just talk about where you were able to make changes -- helping your customers make changes in the bill of material? I know you said up -- a $300 million fund to help achieve some of those improvements. Given the way these Ultrabooks look compared to regular PCs, I just kind of want to know how much were you able to achieve improvements to achieve those mainstream pricing. And how much of those improvements are proprietary to Intel, given your investment in taking costs down?
Paul S. Otellini
Yes. The Ultrabook fund really hasn't kicked in to where it's yielding near-term bill of materials reductions, Uche. We're making those investments now. Some of them have to do with capacity that's coming online for the second half of this year, particularly around capacitive touch screens, to be able to make sure that those come down in price. The biggest changes are, quite frankly, just competition. When you -- I talked about 21 designs shipping now, another -- over 100 more coming through the second half of this year. That's driving volume and it's driving people to be competitive on some of these previously niche sort of technologies. And I'll give you one example. ASUS is now shipping a very low profile, 500-gig hard drive into an Ultrabook, something that we didn't think was possible. Yet they've found the technology to do this, and that helps give them an advantage. And I think you'll see other customers do that. The biggest change and the one that we're really focused on is trying to make sure that we intercept the Windows 8 launch with sufficient quantities of Ultrabooks that have touch enabled. And up to now, touch has been a fairly -- almost a $100 adder to cost, the bill of materials cost, and we've seen that come down very dramatically over the last 60, 90 days. As we've worked it and as more and more customers have committed to SKUs, that drives the volume. So the combination of all of these things, of the OEMs and Taiwan Inc. aiming at these volume opportunities is really what's driving prices and costs down.
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
That's great. Any -- do you feel -- think you'll be able to achieve 40% of consumer notebooks and Ultrabooks exiting in 2012? And any update as to enterprise adoption of Ultrabooks? I know it's probably early days to say, but any sense as to what you can give us, that'd be helpful.
Paul S. Otellini
On the 40%, yes. I'm still very confident we can do that. All the signs are tracking there. I mean, everything we've looked at since we first gave that number set has gotten more positive. More designs, better price points, et cetera, et cetera, lower costs. So all the first derivative indicators are very positive around that. In terms of enterprise adoption, enterprise tends to be a little bit slower. A lot of enterprises like our vPro technology, the vPro-based SKUs for Ultrabooks I think come out this summer, first ones, and then start ramping over the course of the year. I will say that hasn't stopped the people in this room from having Ultrabooks. As I look around the table, most of them are Ultrabooks. So this enterprise, for one, is adopting them.
Stacy J. Smith
Over the objections of our CIO.

Your next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo.
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Could you tell us where we might expect the Romley equivalent for multiprocessor or four-way servers?
Stacy J. Smith
I'm not sure what we've said publicly on that. It's not far off, David, but I don't want to preannounce that. I don't want to preannounce the MP version of Romley. There's more Romley versions to come, as you said. The MP version and then the low-end version of Romley. And I'm not sure how precise we've been in terms of the launch date, so I'm, Mark's telling we haven't said. So let's just say it's in the not-too-distant future.
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Okay. I think that you have said, though, that the die size on Ivy Bridge is about -- for a quad core, is about 160 square millimeters, quite a bit less than the quad core die size of a Sandy Bridge. So does that mean that the Ivy Bridge platform cost, when you've got your cost normalized, will actually be quite a bit less than Sandy Bridge too?
Stacy J. Smith
Yes, I'll talk more about long-term trends in May in the investor meeting. But I will say that even -- I kind of talked about the cost accounting of these new factories coming on in Ivy Bridge. I'll end 2011 -- 2012 with a lower platform cost than I had at the end of 2011, even with these new factories. So I think that gives you a sense of both the ramp rate and the cost curves.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of JoAnne Feeney with Longbow Research.
JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC
I was hoping you could perhaps give us some insight into the mix you anticipate for corporate versus consumer this year. What kind of demand are you seeing out of the emerging markets? And what kind of demand are you seeing out of the more industrialized markets right now?
Stacy J. Smith
We don't get into that level of detail on a forecast basis. I'll say for Q1, JoAnne, our mix was quite healthy. We didn't see any significant shift in mix. Generally I think as we progress through the year, what we're going to see is relative strength based on the strength of the Ivy Bridge product line and the Romley product line in their respective segments. And then we're likely to see some price competition at the low end of the market that all kind of plays into my benign pricing environment that I expect for the year. But we don't get into that level of detail typically on a forecast.
Paul S. Otellini
But I'd add, though, JoAnne, that typically, the enterprise SKUs, particularly in notebooks, tend to be about 1/3 of the business. And that's been true sort of year in, year out for a long time. The trend that is underlying that, though, is that more and more businesses are allowing their employees to bring any kind of computer they want into the office. And so you're seeing a bit less rigidity around that number than we've seen in the past, and it tends to get a little bit more mixed. We think that we've got some ideas on how to improve those -- the security and manageability of those machines over time, while still giving the employees the choice of what they want to bring in.
JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC
Great, and I -- a nice segue into the follow-up. On the margin front, how do you see the PC CPU margins? I know you had said overall pricing is expected to be benign. I'm thinking more about next year. How do you see those margins differing between, say, your standard notebook and your Ultrabook and your tablet? Do you see mix as a threat to overall margins or as, perhaps, a helping factor?
Stacy J. Smith
I think our mix has been very strong. And I'll talk more about the segments of the business in May. But between Ultrabooks and the rest of the client business, we've got a great cost structure and a rich mix. And I think you can kind of see it in the overall results. If you just do the gross margin math for the company between our Q1 actual, our Q2 forecast, we kind of average 63% for the first half. To get to a 64% gross margin for the year, it says we have to be up around 65% on the back half. And that's -- as we're ramping Ivy Bridge, it says we're seeing Ultrabook volumes really ramp-up.

Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Paul, I have a longer-term question. It's clear the emerging markets have been driving a lot of PC growth. I'm curious, longer-term, do you think these emerging markets go more towards Ultrabooks or towards tablets? And what implications will that have on Intel's pricing?
Paul S. Otellini
I don't think anyone in the world knows the answer to that question, Vivek. I think a lot of that has -- has to depends on -- if you look at people buying tablets today, particularly in the iPad arena, there are people that have started out PCs and very often still use PCs. And it's a complimentary device. How that unfolds 2, 3 years from now, I don't think anyone knows. What I am very excited about, and I alluded to this in my opening comments, is this notion of bringing the convenience, the thin-ness, the instant-on capability and the touch of a tablet combined with the productivity, the compatibility and the usefulness of a keyboard into the same device. And you'll see a number of these shipping second half of this year as the energies of our OEMs and the ODMs gets unleashed into this category. And I think that it's way too early to have a debate on Ultrabook versus tablet because in fact, in my view, the long-term form factor is probably somewhere in between those 2 devices.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Got it. And Paul, secondly, on your smartphone and tablet strategy, I mean, if I look at the industry, it's clear that Apple and Samsung are now accounting for an increasing number of units and even more, almost half of the industry sales. So does that leave enough room in the market for you to go after and have an impact on your sales and profitability? Is it enough potential for you to go after this market?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, sure. I mean, any numbers that we look at going forward has smartphones, going from sort of $450 million to close to $1 billion as smartphones, as most phones become smartphones. And even if you take out half of the market, which I would be loath to do, but even if you take it out, it's still a very large number. I'd point out, too, that those are both companies that we are continuing to have dialogue with in terms of our product line. And Samsung doesn't universally use its chips in its phones. They use other vendors, and that's certainly an account we would love to win for phones. And I can't ever speak for Apple, but we know where they are and they know where we are.

Your next question comes from the line of Gus Richard with Piper Jaffrey.
Auguste Gus Richard - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division
Stacy, just a follow up on the comment on gross margins and the ramp on 32. When I go back and I look at '10 in Q2, your margins peaked. And so if we were following the historic patterns, I would expect margins to be pricing here and not falling. And I'm just not sure if the ramp on -- shifted in time or there's something else going on that I don't understand?
Stacy J. Smith
You have to go back one quarter. It was Q1 of '10, not Q2 of '10.
Auguste Gus Richard - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division
Okay. So there was a -- all right. So it was a slight drop. So that the cadence...
Stacy J. Smith
It is offset by one quarter. Then if you look at that margin every time you see that, our cost in Q1 of '10 went up. I don't remember the exact number, but it was pretty significantly based on the ramp of 32 nanometer, just as we're seeing as we get into that C part of the ramp on 22 nanometer.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Craig Berger with FBR Capital Markets.
Craig Berger - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division
Can you help us understand what your capacity growth looks like by the time we're in the second half of the year versus, say, last year's second half and what utilizations are at and what might they be ramping to in the second quarter, second half?
Stacy J. Smith
Well, the first part of your question is a little -- yes, the CapEx that we're spending is more to transition from one generation to the next. There is some capacity growth in there, but it's probably less than you're thinking. We expect utilization rates to be high through the year. And you can see it in Q2 where we're selling every Ivy Bridge unit we can make, and we think that continues.
Craig Berger - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division
Okay. And then just as a follow-up, can you help us understand, I think depreciation is supposed to be $1.6 billion in the second quarter. Where might that go in the back half of the year as any additional 22-nanometer factories turn on?
Stacy J. Smith
I think you can kind of see the -- you can interpolate the depreciation number because you've seen Q1 actual, Q2 forecast and then the back half or -- then the forecast for the year. I think at the base of your question, it's probably going up less than you were anticipating. This comes back to my comment in the January call. You have to keep in mind that a pretty large proportion of our capacity or our CapEx in 2012 is in building factories, and that has a much longer depreciation schedule than does putting equipment into the factories. I think back in January I said it was over 1/3. I actually refined that later in the quarter and said it was more like 40% of the total amount of CapEx that we're spending this year is going to be on buildings and fabs as opposed to equipment. So I think that's why you're seeing less of an impact to depreciation than maybe your historical models would suggest.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung with Citi.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
The first one is just looking at this idea of high single-digit growth for the year, it implies that the back half is at least seasonal. Actually, it should be higher than normal seasonal. And I've heard your comment on Data Center being very strong. But if we looked across PC clients, maybe a potential for handsets or a micro server or maybe software, where do you see the above seasonal strength coming from in the back half of the year?
Stacy J. Smith
I think the biggest part of this is that we're exiting Q1 with historically low levels of inventory. There's not much of a replenishment in Q2. And then as Ivy Bridge ramps in, as people gear up for the kind of normal Q4 selling season, we expect inventory levels to replenish some in the third quarter. That's the biggest shift and we talked about that at the beginning of the year. That's what kind of causes the shift of units to the back half.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
Okay. Fair enough. Second question, Paul, is for you. As you talked to your customers or your potential customers in handset, can you talk about to what extent 2 things matter to them? One, your technology roadmap, particularly as you're able to talk to them about 14 nanometer? And then two, just the fact that you actually have or will have the capacity available -- because obviously elsewhere, we're seeing very tight supply on what's now 28-nanometer.
Paul S. Otellini
Well, the roadmap is certainly the best door opener we have in talking to these customers, but it's not the only asset we have here. Then there's 2 classes of handset customers. There's obviously the traditional OEM manufacturers, and we've announced a number of those; but there's also carriers that are interested in doing a private label, and we've announced one of those with Orange in Europe. And the relationships that we have with carriers globally are pretty strong, and they go back a number of years. And those are -- those have to do with a lot of the work that Intel has done in their data centers and in the reconfiguration of the cellular network infrastructure. As both classes of customers look at the handset roadmap, what they want to do is find ways to provide differentiation from what's out there and service platforms for themselves. That's where the other element of our strategy, the non-silicon element of our strategy, becomes much more critical. And so what's our security roadmap as it relates to that? What's our location-based services capability? What kinds of sensors can we build into the handset? All of those are really hardware-centric features that employ software that allow someone to create a service annuity stream. That discussion is much more sophisticated and complex than just showing a roadmap. And that's the level that we're at today with most customers.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
First question for Stacy. I think you mentioned earlier that the BCG group would start growing double-digits. Did you mean year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter in that second quarter comment? And how should we think about the contribution of the network and storage traction that you really hadn't been addressing as much in the past?
Stacy J. Smith
Year-over-year. And thanks for the opportunity to clarify that. So yes, when I think about BCG, I'm always doing year-over-year comps because of the growth rate of that business. And I'll hold off, I think, on going through the various segments of the BCG business. We will talk a lot about that in May. But if I take you back to what we said last May, which I still believe to be true, we're seeing secular demand drivers that are driving the classic server business, and that's the build-out of these big IP data centers. And then from an Intel perspective, we're benefiting by the fact that our architecture is now extending into things like storage and networking and even some of the backplane infrastructure in the data center, and so that's giving us added growth. But we'll go through that in a lot more detail in May.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Great. And the follow-up question is one for Paul, and it's a bigger-picture manufacturing one. In your preamble, you mentioned about Intel being able to do things others couldn't from a manufacturing point of view. To that end, as you're able to pull further ahead of the competition on Moore's Law, how should we think about that benefit manifesting itself, either strategically for Intel or on the types of markets you can address, the revenue growth margins or even the business model implications that you can do with things like potentially entering the foundry business, et cetera?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, the business model that we have today is one that I'm extremely comfortable with and we're working as hard as possible to maintain, which is -- and I described this last year in the analyst meeting. As compared to other non-integrated device manufacturers, we get paid twice for our products. We get paid the equivalent of a foundry margin, and we get paid the equivalent of an architectural margin and that allows us to generate fairly nice margins. So as long as we can fill up all of the factories we can build with Intel products at those kinds of rewards in terms of the ROI, that makes the most sense for us. Are there opportunities out in time to take advantage of the lead that we're building in areas like foundry? Yes, perhaps, and I've said that before. And you've seen some small announcements to that effect, where we've signed up some companies for some foundry activity over the next several years. I would look at those, and I would ask you to look at those as being learning experiences for us. A lot of the work we're doing here is to build the libraries, the tools that allow us as a company and our designers of the company to be able to use quick time to market, quick derivative capabilities, modularity for our SoC businesses going forward. And the best way to test those is to have some third-party customers to really validate how good they are, how -- or where they need some work. So it's a learning expense for us. It is for profit, it is not done strictly for -- just to get to know how to do this. And in terms of where it goes long term, I'll leave that point open.
Stacy J. Smith
And if I can maybe just add, one of the tactical benefits we see being an integrated design and manufacturing house is the speed at which we can ramp these factories. We'll have 25% of our shipment volume in Q2 coming from Ivy Bridge on 22 nanometer. And it's just an incredibly fast ramp rate. And even compared to what we did on 32 nanometer, that's a lot faster than what we're able to do. So we can just transition the market to these great new products. And I think you've seen some of the non-integrated models where they really struggle with ramp rates and yields and things like that. So it's a benefit in the long term to the product lineup, and it's a benefit tactically to our ability to transition the product line.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Danely with JPMorgan.
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Actually, Paul, just a follow up on Ross' question. I mean is there anything that would prevent you from getting Apple's processor business for the foundry or QualComm's business? I mean, it would be kind of competing against the Atom. But is that theoretically possible? Are you opposed to anything like that?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, anything is theoretically possible. The things that would stand in the way with that, both of those, would be the right commercial agreement. I have to say that from a -- from the kind of taste it would leave my mouth, the Apple win would be a little bit -- a lot more attractive than the QualComm win.
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Something tells me it will help the stock, too. As my follow-up, can you just maybe give us your sense of just the trend in PC demand out there? And in particular, if you could just spend a little time on the various deals, what you see happening in China and North America and Europe? Is it seasonal yet? Is it better than seasonal? Worse than seasonal? Getting better or getting worse? Any words would be appreciated.
Paul S. Otellini
Our geo managers are in this week, and we're going through the reviews. And the question I've been asking everyone as they come through here is do you see the year any differently than you did 3 months ago, the last time we were all together face-to-face? And the answer is universally no. It's -- this is playing out exactly as we had predicted so far. It's only 3 months into the year. But given that we now have line of sight to Q2 and we've sort of worked our way through the HDD morass, it's feeling pretty good. As I look out towards the second half of the year, it doesn't take a lot to deliver the kind of numbers we're talking about. Stacy gave an indication of our view of some inventory refill around Ivy Bridge as that ramps up. I'll remind you that we are going into a new -- a year where we have a new version of Microsoft operating system, and that traditionally has been very strong for the industry. And this particular version gives us the opportunity to participate with a mainstream operating system around touch, and I'm very excited about that. So you add those things up, and I think the battle for the consumer dollars even in a soft consumer environment can be -- is not going to be as clear anti-PC as it perhaps was last year. And lastly, we're not going to get trapped into giving numbers, but we do feel a little bit validated about the fact that the third-party analysts raised their numbers to equal ours, particularly around the desktop business, which has been a point of difference between us. Also, we're looking for a relatively decent year with strength in emerging markets in all segments, strength in enterprise globally and continuing softness in the Western Europe and potentially United States markets.

Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Stacy, relative to the balance sheet, you guys have done an absolutely terrific job returning cash to shareholders, dividends and buybacks, and you certainly have a terrific capital position. But cash is coming down because your free cash flow is kind of neutral. And then obviously, with the dividends and buybacks, that's drawing the cash level down. How low do you feel comfortable drawing down the cash and still feeling like you're in a tremendous capital position that gives you an advantage?
Stacy J. Smith
Well, one cautionary note. I think you want to be a little careful on the free cash flow generated in Q1 relative to the long-term trend. You have a couple of issues in Q1. First is it's pretty depressed, given what happened with hard disk drives. And as our business recovers, the cash flow is going to improve. And then secondly, remember there's things we accrue for all year long. We have big payments in Q1. That's kind of a couple of billion dollars worth of shift in free cash flow. So that's on the free cash flow side. In terms of cash balances, what -- we don't peg a specific number out there, although I think, as you know, we have very specific conversations with the board. I think you can see in the first quarter, we're obviously pretty comfortable with our cash balances. They changed a little bit, but we've kind of been now bouncing around this number for a couple of quarters.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Okay. And then if I could ask for my follow-up, relative to the view that Ultrabook adoption will pick up steam as the price points get down to a ""mainstream price point,"" if I look at consumer activity today, the iPad 3 is already at a higher price point of where Ultrabooks are today and obviously, had tremendous adoption almost immediately. So how do we get comfortable that it's really a price point issue and not a product preference issue?
Paul S. Otellini
I don't think -- I'm not a subscriber that it takes mainstream price points to get us to high volume. I mean, I think this is -- that just helps. And what you're going to see is an incredible amount of differentiation from $699 to $1,299. And I love that. People are doing different experiments with different screen sizes. I talked earlier about convertibles and hybrids and slide-out keyboards and things like that. Some people are putting touch in, which is a cost adder. I really don't see the need to get to those price points to deliver the value proposition. The price points make everything work better because it lowers the bill of material's cost on some of these previously very expensive niche components.
Mark Henninger 
Right. One last question please, Misty?
Operator
Your final question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Barclays.
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division
I guess first question, as you think about a PC recovery in the second half, curious what you think will be a bigger driver there between Windows 8 and Ultrabooks?
Paul S. Otellini
I think it's way too -- it's a little hard for us to predict that. I mean, the Ultrabook, even as we hit our numbers, we said that's going to be 40% of consumer notebooks at year end. So that's still not the majority of PCs. I think the general issue is that this has been a market which, as we've talked about, has not had a lot of new and exciting products the last few years. And so this year, you've got a one-two punch with Intel and Microsoft both delivering dynamite products that are the result of years of innovation and lots of R&D. And we're hoping -- we are optimistic that the combination of those 2 will bring growth.
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division
That's helpful. And as a quick follow-up, you talked earlier about your manufacturing leadership and clearly, no doubt there. I'm curious if you could provide an update on your plans for 14-nanometer ramp in terms of equipment, installation and when you think you'll come to market there?
Stacy J. Smith
No.
Paul S. Otellini
We'll give you some -- better granularity to that in the Analyst Meeting in May. But generally, it's every other year. From a rule-of-thumb standpoint, that's as granular as I think I want to be right now.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Quarter 4 2011 Intel Corporation Earnings Conference Call. My name is Misty, and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.  I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mark Henninger, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Mark Henninger 
Thank you, Misty, and welcome, everyone to Intel's Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. By now, you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with that. If you've not received both documents, they are currently available on our investor website, intc.com. 
I'm joined today by Paul Otellini, our President and CEO; and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we'll hear a brief remarks from both of them followed by Q&A.
By way of announcement, we'll be hosting our annual Investor Day at our headquarters in Santa Clara on Thursday, May 10, and we look forward to seeing many of you there.
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Also if during this call, we use any non-GAAP financial measures or references, we will post the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliations to our website intc.com. So with that, let me hand it over to Paul.
Paul S. Otellini
Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon everyone. 2011 was a year of records, milestones and breakthroughs. I want to begin by highlighting a few of the most significant. We reinvented the transistor with our 3-D Tri-Gate technology. We unveiled a new generation of personal computers, the Ultrabook. We closed 2 large acquisitions: McAfee and Infineon Wireless Solutions. We broke ground on the world's first 14-nanometer fabs, D1X in Oregon and Fab 42 in Arizona. And our 2011 revenue and earnings were the best in Intel's history.
We surpassed $50 billion in revenue for the first time, after crossing $40 billion for the first time just last year. This was our second consecutive year of more than 20% revenue growth. Since 2009, we have added $19 billion to the top line. The investments we've made to innovate and to expand our capabilities are paying off. Let me highlight a few examples.
As the volume of traffic crossing the Internet continues to explode, this has left companies and individuals searching for simple ways to store, manage and access this flood of information. This mega trend led to a fantastic year for our Data Center Group, with revenue up 17% on record microprocessor units, exceeding $10 billion for the first time. But this wasn't just servers. Storage revenue was up 42% to a new record high, and our Embedded Communications Infrastructure business was up 18%, also to a new record high.
Volume shipments of our Sandy Bridge server product, code-named Romley, have begun. We also demonstrated Knights Corner, the first single-chip coprocessor capable of delivering a teraflop of computing power.
Turning now to our PC business. We saw record notebook microprocessor units in 2011, as the PC Client Group grew 17%, fueled by demand in the enterprise and emerging markets, and PC users' appetites for higher performance and more energy-efficient computing. The result was a second consecutive year of rising ASPs, as our mix of core CPUs increased to nearly 70%. Sandy Bridge microprocessors accounted for approximately 40% of the company's total revenue.
Emerging markets now account for 2 out of every 3 incremental units of PC demand, a shift that's rewarding Intel and the PC companies that have a long-standing, deep presence in these markets. 
Looking back at the last 12 months of reported data, emerging markets like India and Indonesia grew 22% and 37%, respectively. China, now the largest PC market in the world, represents 20% of all PC demand, and grew a remarkable 15%. Even with that, China has a household penetration rate of just 35%, versus almost 90% in the U.S. China is the world's largest market for mobile phones with more than 950 million subscribers. It's also at the forefront of the smartphone boom and will be the home of the world's first 32-nanometer smartphone.
Last week at CES, Lenovo announced the K800 smartphone based on our Medfield SoC. The K800 will be available on the China Unicom network in Q2, and will showcase Intel architecture in a phone with very competitive battery life and outstanding performance.
2011 was also a year in which we completed several important acquisitions. In the first quarter, we completed the purchase of McAfee and Intel Mobile Communications, formerly the Infineon Wireless division. Together, McAfee and IMC added $3.6 billion in revenue and new strategic capabilities in security and connectivity that will allow us to extend our strategies across the continuum of computing. McAfee has already announced the Deep Safe platform, around which we are building a family of products to take advantage of the combination of McAfee software and Intel silicon to deliver first-of-its-kind protection against day 0 threats.
Lastly, in the fourth quarter, we announced the acquisition of Telmap, whose location-based search and navigation expertise will allow us to add differentiated services to Intel architecture-based devices from Ultrabooks to smartphones. As many of you know, we made several important announcements at CES last week. In addition to the Lenovo K800, we announced the Medfield-based smartphone reference design that boasts a sleek form factor, 8 hours of talk time, 6 hours of 1080p video playback and 14 days of standby power, clearly demonstrating the low-power, high-performance capabilities of Intel architecture. Yet as the performance of this device that really showcases what's possible when you combine advanced process technology and the world's most popular computer architecture. Though Medfield is our very first smartphone SoC, independent testers appointed to benchmarks to place Medfield reference design among the very best in the markets.
It was this differentiated performance and exceptional roadmap and exciting new usage models that led to our multiyear, multi-device strategic relationship with Motorola Mobility. The first of these Intel architecture-based devices will go through carrier certification this summer with commercial availability shortly thereafter. And while the Lenovo and Motorola designs are exciting first steps, we're not done making announcements in the smartphone space.
In the months ahead, we're looking forward to sharing with you a range of exciting new products. Let me highlight just a few. We'll launch Romley for servers in the first quarter. We'll launch Ivy Bridge, our first 22-nanometer product, in early spring. Ivy Bridge will improve on the graphics performance of Sandy Bridge by more than 70%. The industry will bring more than 70 new Ultrabook designs to market this year. And when Windows 8 launches, we'll be ready with both PCs and tablets.
In summary, 2011 was an outstanding year for Intel. As we look to 2012, we're excited about bringing more Intel innovations to the market. With that, let me turn the meeting over to Stacy.
Stacy J. Smith
Thanks, Paul. 2011 was our most profitable year and a year of record revenues. Revenue of $54 billion was up over $10 billion or 24% from a year ago and was our second year in a row with business growing greater than 20%. Our PC Client Group and our Data Center Group both grew at 17% year-on-year. In addition, we closed on the acquisitions of McAfee and the Infineon Wireless division in 2011 which contributed $3.6 billion to our revenue growth.
Gross margin of 62.5% in 2011 was at the high-end of our historical range, as our investments in industry-leading manufacturing process technology continued to enable leadership products, which drove a richer mix across client and server. Spending, as a percent of revenue, was approximately flat at 29.7%. Operating income, net income and earnings per share were all records.
Non-GAAP operating income of $18.4 billion was up 18% year-on-year, and non-GAAP earnings per share was up 25% from a year ago.
For the year, we generated a record $21 billion of cash from operations. We invested over $8 billion in research and development, $10.8 billion in capital assets, primarily building and equipping leading-edge factories; and spent $8.7 billion on acquisitions. Additionally, we paid $4.1 billion in dividends, increasing the annualized dividend per share by 33% and increasing our dividend payout ratio to 40% of free cash flow. Lastly, we used our stock repurchase program to return over $14 billion of cash to shareholders in 2011, reducing diluted shares outstanding from a year ago by roughly 450 million shares.
Total cash investments ended the year at $14.8 billion, down approximately $6.7 billion from a year ago. Fourth quarter revenue finished at $13.9 billion, up $2.4 billion and 21% from the fourth quarter of 2010.
As we announced in December, revenue in the fourth quarter was negatively impacted by the floods in Thailand and the resulting hard disk drive supply shortage. As a result of the hard disk drive shortage, we saw a reduction of orders for microprocessors as customers reduced inventories across the supply chain. Despite this reduction in inventory levels, it is our belief that the shortage did not impact the actual sales of personal computers in the fourth quarter, with demand trends playing out as expected. 
Gross margin improved to 64.5% from the third quarter, with lower factory start-up costs as we qualified for sale our first product on 22-nanometer process technology and lower unit costs. Non-GAAP operating income of $4.8 billion was up 20% from a year ago and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.68 was up 21% from a year ago. 
As we look forward to the first quarter of 2012, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $12.8 billion, down 8% from the fourth quarter. This decline is slightly more than the average seasonal decline as we expect the shortage of hard disk drives to continue to impact our business in the first quarter. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range for the first quarter to be down 1.5 points to 63%, but manufacturing costs going up as we begin to sell our first 22-nanometer product, Ivy Bridge, and ship lower volumes, when compared to the fourth quarter.
Turning to 2012. We are planning on another strong year, with revenue growth in the high single-digits and gross margin at the high end of our historical range, at 64%. Importantly, we will continue to invest in our business in 2012. We are forecasting an increase in capital spending to $12.5 billion as we build the world's first high-volume manufacturing factories for 14-nanometer process technology. We are also forecasting an increase in investment in research and development of $1.8 billion. We are making critical investments in R&D for Ultrabooks, data centers, phones and tablets. In addition, we are making R&D investments in core capabilities like security, SoCs and extending our process technology leadership.
The trends that we discussed in May drove our performance in 2011, and we expect will drive our financial performance in 2012. We expect continued strength in emerging markets as rising incomes increase the affordability of personal computers. We will continue to benefit from the explosion of devices that compute and connect to the Internet as they've drive the build-out of the cloud infrastructure and as we expect to generate more sales in storage, communications and networking products for this segment.
Our process technology and manufacturing advantage will continue to extend in 2012, enabling a leadership product portfolio, not just in PCs and servers, but also in low-power products for phones, tablets and embedded systems. With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.
Mark Henninger 
All right. Thank you, Stacy and Paul. We'll now move to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Misty, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Your first question comes from the line of Glen Yeung with Citi.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
I guess, the first one is, Stacy, in your forecast for gross margins, I think you have 50 basis points in there for higher revenues. And I hear your point about higher -- high single-digit revenue growth for the year. What's your PC forecast assumption that underlies that?
Stacy J. Smith
You're talking for the year, Glen? Or are you talking...
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
Yes, for 2012.
Stacy J. Smith
For 2012. It will play out, we believe, pretty similar to this year. There'll be some unit growth, but I believe we'll also benefit from the fact that we have a very strong product portfolio and we'll benefit from a rich mix. You've seen that over the last couple of years. And if I can just take a second here, just to put the high single-digit revenue growth in perspective. If you go back to 2011 and you strip out the acquisitions and the fact that we had a 53rd week, you're left with an underlying growth rate for what I'll call the existing core business, of about 15%. You compare that to the high single-digit forecast for 2012, you see. We do expect it to come down some, that's because we expect GDP growth rates to come down a little bit and we do correlate to GDP growth rates. But still, the same kind of drivers in '12 that we saw in '11.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
Okay. The other question I have is on unit costs. And again, in your written comments, it suggests that they'll be up for the quarter end for the year. And I wonder if you could just walk us through the puts and takes on unit costs in particular. And I guess, I'm kind of wondering if more Ivy Bridge ultimately results in reduced unit costs at some point.
Stacy J. Smith
Yes. The unit cost increase that we're seeing in Q1 and over the course of '12 is a normal phenomenon, as we're ramping new factories and new process technologies. If you go back 2 years, and you have to offset it for a different quarter, but if you go back and you look at the first 32-nanometer products, what you see is, as we're just starting to ramp those big factories, the first products are coming out, those tend to be pretty expensive products, and then the cost kind of comes down over the course of the year. It's a consistent phenomenon that we've seen before.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.
Mark Lipacis - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division
In thinking about, as you guys get more success in the smartphone and tablet markets, comparing the strategy there to your PC market -- PC microprocessor market, in PCs, you're up and down the stack, you're everywhere. And I'm wondering if that's your intention in the handset and tablet market? And whether or not that necessarily means that there's a different business model for that business versus your core business.
Paul S. Otellini
Let me take that one, Mark. Our intention is to participate broadly in all 3 of those markets. In tablets, I think we'll be able to do that from day one, as you see the Android tablets coming out and Windows 8 tablets coming out. And you'll see us well-positioned in multiple price point on those. And who knows where those prices go over time, but our intention would be to use the advanced silicon integration capability we have to be able to drive the build material cost down, integration up in tablet space, which I think is going to be a sweet spot for Intel. On phones, our strategy is a little bit different. We're coming in at the top of the smartphone market. Our value proposition initially is aimed at best performance and very competitive feature sets and very good battery life. Over -- and then let me say on the other end of the market, the Infineon acquisition has given us a very strong position in basic phones and feature phones. They shipped 400 million modems this year into the cell phone business. So over time, what we'll want to do is grow that capability up by integrating the apps processor and the comm processors onto the same chip, while we drive our initial positions in apps processors from the top down.
Mark Lipacis - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division
And does that mean that -- are those businesses -- are they -- do they inherently carry a different profitability than your core PC microprocessor business? Or is that too early to say?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, the pattern today of the vendors in that space is that the margin is -- their margins are lower than ours. Now if you remember, their margins only reflect half of the equation. Most of -- virtually all of them use a foundry. So as we enter this business, we intend to get paid twice. We get paid a foundry margin while optimizing our product on our silicon, and then the architectural margin.
Stacy J. Smith
If I can just add to that, Mark. As I look out over the next few years, we'll have success in these devices. I think they'll start to grow earnings for us out in time. It doesn't change my intermediate view of long-term gross margins. And if we end up in a situation where we're seeing a lot more success in those businesses and we're growing earnings but it causes gross margins to come down a little bit, that's a trade-off that we'll gladly make at that time.
Mark Lipacis - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division
Fair enough, and if I could ask a follow-up on the...
Mark Henninger 
Mark, I want to try and make sure we get as many callers as we can, so we'll move on.

Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
My first question is on Ultrabooks. So a number of announcements at CES. Conceptually, do you expect this to expand the category? Or do you think it's just going to cannibalize notebook sales that you might have had anyway? How has the feedback been from your early customers?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, let me just say, I'm not seeing this level of excitement in our customer base since, even before Centrino, which is 2003. People are very excited about the feature set and having the PC reenergized. I think initially, what you're going to see is that this will be replacement of existing notebook sales and customers and so forth. People will trade up for it. It's a very exciting new product. As we go through the course of 2012, particularly as -- and into '13, as Windows 8 machines rollout, you have the possibility, and then as I look at our design wins, the probability of many of those machines incorporating touch. At that point, it's hard to tell what the market impact is going to be because the PC now has the characteristics of the best of all tablets and very high performance-capable machine -- notebooks. So I don't know that we know how that plays out. No one knows how that plays out. What I know is that we'll be well positioned for it in any direction.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Got it. And one on -- follow-up on CapEx this time. So you obviously decided to raise the CapEx for this year. And -- Intel has always had a very strong lead versus competitors, 1 or 2-year lead. So I'm curious, what are the criteria that you use to decide to accelerate CapEx? Like what is the incremental benefit that this provides you? And I know that in the past year you said that you expect to get paid for it, but over what time frame? And I'm just curious as to how you make those decisions.
Stacy J. Smith
Yes, it's a good question. So I just want to come back and clarify something. The CapEx that we're spending doesn't increase our cadence of Moore's Law. We're still on a 2-year cadence, and as we have shown you in investor meetings, we would go faster if we could but we don't think the industry can keep up with us. Your point, though, is still valid and that based on everything we see from other people that are building factories, they're struggling to solve some of the same problems that the cadence that we solved. So I think our process technology lead is extending. The way we get paid for that is simple. We can put more features, more performance and bring power envelopes down faster than the competition can. I think if you look historically, we've gotten paid for that by driving cost down at a curve, and we're going to still use cost as one of the ways that we get paid here. But increasingly, if you look at the last 2-plus years, we've also gotten paid by bringing out these really capable products and driving a richer mix. And that's really been the story over the last couple of years, is by integrating the graphics transistors to end -- to our leading-edge process technology, we're creating much more capable products, we're putting other features on those products, things like WiDi and things that differentiate us from the market, and we get paid in a richer mix. And so that's where our strategy going forward is we'll have cost-reduced products, and we'll have then also a portfolio of really capable products where we drive a sell up.

Your next question comes from the line of Alex Gauna with JMP Securities.
Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division
Paul, I know you don't guide by segment, but can you talk about what's in the down March quarter? What's happening on the Data Center side of things? And what's your sense on how market demand is holding up ahead of the Romley refresh? When do we really see those numbers coming through and how strong will they be?
Stacy J. Smith
Yes, let me do kind of a higher level of what we're seeing by segment and then Paul will pick up and talk about Romley in particular and where it’s heading. If you step back and look at the Data Center Group in 2011, it grew revenue 17%. And if you think back to the investor meeting, we told you our plan was to grow 15% at the top line and consistent on the bottom line. We did that in '11. Based on everything we see for '12, we have high confidence that we can continue to grow at that kind of a rate. We're not going to get into a quarter-by-quarter because remember, the service business can be pretty -- the Data Center business can be pretty lumpy if there's one big customer that's buying and a big buying pattern, you'll see a pop-up and it can come down the next quarter. But on the secular basis, we're pretty confident in the growth trends.
Paul S. Otellini
And let me address the Romley one, in particular, Alex. We're seeing right now, stronger demand for Romley than we did from the Nehalem at the same point of its life sort of 2 years ago. The product is in high-volume production now getting ready for our customers assistance launches later this quarter and into early Q2. It provides an outstanding value proposition and a good ROI for CIOs to evaluate. I think, though, that this is not -- initially it will not drive that kind of replacement cycle that we saw for Nehalem because it's still relatively new machines. On the other hand, I think people will embrace this machine for high-capacity needs. We talked earlier about the build-out of Internet data centers, about storage and other segments in this type of Data Center and I think this product is probably the most well-rounded product we've produced in this genre so far.
Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division
And then as a follow-up, if could ask. If we think about...
Stacy J. Smith
Actually, Alex, I'm going to -- Alex, we want to make sure we get on to the next caller. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Paul, congrats on a very strong year. Overall, as we look at the flood impact that you mentioned in your guidance, how should we think about that snapping back and maybe just within your guidance of being up 8% for the entire year of high single-digits, how should we think about seasonality considering the floods snapback, multiple discrete items like Ivy Bridge coming out, Romley, Windows 8, Ultrabook, et cetera?
Paul S. Otellini
You're absolutely right. There's probably more moving pieces as I look out over the next 11.5 months than I can recall for a long time, Ross. So let me start with the flood first. Our view and the view from our customers, and I talked to everybody at CES, from OEMs to OEMs, it's very consistent, is that the industry seems to be hitting the bottom of their output trough in the January, February time frame and then it starts recovering from there. Everything we've seen so far suggests that anyone on Earth who wanted to buy a PC has been able to buy a PC. There's not -- there may be some spot stockouts of a particular SKU at a particular store, but all of our channels are still showing pretty good sales outgrowth and that seems a strong indicator as we go through this underlying demand. I think that you will see -- we have seen a compression of the supply chain that hit us very dramatically in the fourth quarter and was the result of the driver for our pre-announcement. And it's also the driver, as Stacy said, for our being under seasonality in Q1. We think that there's likely to be some refilling of those pipes in the second quarter, early third quarter, as the supply lines come back in normalcy. On the other hand, it's very possible that people just learned to live with leaner inventories, which is always very good for us. As a result, we see a more nonlinear, more second half loaded year this year than we've seen for quite some time, in terms of CPU shipments, not necessarily for a PC shipments.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Great, and I guess as the one follow-up switching to Stacy on the gross margin line, ASP has been a lot of a tailwind for your goodness in the gross margin line over the last 2 years. What's the expectation for ASPs in 2012? And do they need to rise again for your gross margin guidance 
of 64% to be attained?
Stacy J. Smith
I'm predicting growth of ASPs to be what I'll call pretty benign in 2012. We have a strong product line. We’ve generated a strong mix. I think maintaining that is probably a pretty likely case. And then what we're watching is with Ultrabooks, as they ramp into the -- a much higher percentage of the consumer market in the back half of the year, that could give us a little bit of an oomph, but I'm not counting on that -- my gross margin forecast, but it certainly one of the things we'd like to see happen. You also have to keep in mind that one of the less bright spots for us in 2011 was that netbooks were way down. And so I'm going to see kind of a natural mixing up as I go from '10 to '11 and '11 to '12 with less netbooks and a large percentage of the total being Core.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
I guess my main question is: What is the incremental growth in capacity as a result of last year's CapEx and this year's CapEx? And how does that capacity kind of layer on over the course of the year? And then the follow-up part and parcel of that, so that we can just kill everything at once, is what is the assumption around factory loadings as that capacity growth ramps over the course of the year?
Stacy J. Smith
I'll be -- I have to be a little long-winded I think, to get to both of those. So first, let's talk about what's driving the capital spending. And I'll be the first to admit when I see numbers like the $10.8 billion in 2011 and $12.5 billion for 2012, those are big numbers. I have to step back and look at it against the context of how much our business has grown. We were up 25% from '09 to '10, we're up 24% from '10 to '11, so it's more than 50% growth in 2 years. Put another way, it's almost $20 billion of incremental revenue over the course of that time period. When you look at that in that context, it makes sense. And just to give you one other data point that at least helps me be comfortable here, I think my depreciation as a percent of revenue in 2012 stays in a healthy range. So I think that gives me some comfort. In terms of the makeup of the specific capital in '12, it's more heavily weighted than what we've historically seen to building buildings. And Andy told you in the investor meeting that we've kind a -- it's a 2-year cycle and we're building buildings. So we're seeing that it's more than 1/3 of the total capital in '12. I think that piece starts to come down in '13. And remember, that piece has a much longer useful life which means we depreciated over a much longer period of time. The equipment piece actually comes down from '11 to '12, and that's a little more -- it's heavily weighted towards 14-nanometer equipment that we're putting in place. So that's kind of the makeup of the capital. In terms of utilizations, we're running full out today. We're just at the beginning edge of 22-nanometer. Every unit that we can get out there, we can sell. So we're running the new stuff full out. We did take a little bit of advantage in Q4 based on the hard disk drive shortage. We took some older generation capacity off-line to avoid putting some older generation product in inventory and we utilize that equipment, as you've seen us do before, to offset -- to go a little faster on 22-nanometer. So those are responsive things that we do. But I think we're running full out today, and I think will be nicely loaded over the course of 2012.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Uche Orji with UBS.
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Stacy, can I just start off by asking you about gross margins? Your full year gross margin guidance is about 1 point higher than Q1. Is there any way for us to think about it typically not in Q4? How that should play out through the year?
Stacy J. Smith
It's a hard year to talk about normal seasonality. But you should, based on what Paul told you in terms of how we're viewing the impact of the hard disk drive shortage, it says we have a back-end-loaded year from a unit standpoint that will clearly give us a little bit of a tailwind. You also have to remember that those first wafers that come off the line for 22-nanometer, these are big factories, the very first products are coming off the line now. Those tend to be pretty expensive and that cost comes down over the course of the year as well. So those are things that give you a tailwind into the back half of the year -- give me tailwind over the back half of the year.
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
All right. Can I just go back to the question of channel inventory? I mean, you described it as historically lean. And Paul, you said people might just be willing to leave with -- they may choose to leave with these levels of inventory. But let's assume that we get to the hard disk drive issue and inventory were to go back to normal levels. Where are we now? Can you quantify where these historically low levels are? And if we went back to normal, how much more weeks of inventory do you think your distributors need to carry to sustain what should be a fairly robust second half of the year?
Paul S. Otellini
I think we're talking about less -- I mean, remember, we ship kind of a 1 million unit today as an industry. So we're talking about something – a correction, that's in the order of a week, Uche. It's not like this is a months’ worth of inventory. And really, as much as that can get compensated for, in either direction, by the decisions of OEMs to put things on boats versus airplanes. And so I think while there's still a shortage of drives, you're going to see more use of planes, shipping things from Asia to the end markets. And depending on how things, how fast things recover, you may see people go back to boats, which puts a bit more buffer into the system. It's on the order of a week, not in the order of a month.
Stacy J. Smith
Yes, and it probably comes down a little bit more -- and it doesn't probably. It almost certainly comes down more in Q1 and our view is in that that's the level of inventory that they can live with. They just -- they may not go all the way back up to the previews inventory levels. We see that as these things play out. And as Paul said, over time, leaner inventory levels in the supply chain and then the kind of things we can do to be just in time, they actually make the supply chains much more efficient. They benefit our business over time.

Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
I guess, Paul, my first question on Ultrabooks. Are there any sort of milestones that you can share with us as far as percent of notebooks exiting the year that you would expect to be on Ultrabook? And I guess, as you think about kind of ASP versus unit growth this year for you guys in PCG, how important is getting Ultrabook up in the curve as a percentage of notebooks to kind of the mix story this year?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, let me start with the mix and work backwards, John. I said that core is approximately 70% of our mix already and I don't know that that's going to go 90%, and there's no way it's going likely down to 50%. So I think we're sort of in -- it's historically high for our premium brand, but I think we're in the sweet spot for what we're going to see, certainly the bulk of 2012 because the Ultrabooks are going to be Core-centric. And what we can't yet predict is the mix between i3, i5 and i7. Right now, the stuff that's sold in Christmas and into January were a very good mix of i5s and i7s, but the price points were $8.99, $9.99. As we move towards the second half of the year, and price points come down maybe as low as $6.99, the mix may come down a bit to i3s. But I still think you're going to see people position this as a premium product. Their industry is enjoying a little sell-up around it. In terms of a target, what we said before is that our goal this year will be to exit the year at about 40% of consumer notebooks being Ultrabook.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
And then guys, as my follow-up, Stacy, just a follow-up to Uche's question on gross margins, the 63% for Q1 versus the 64% for the full year on a high 9 -- high single-digit revenue growth, I would have thought you would have seen more margin expansion. Is this conservatism? Or is this kind of the penalty you're paying as depreciation grows relative to the CapEx spending?
Stacy J. Smith
I don't think it's either. I don't think I'm being overly conservative, although I certainly hope so. And it's not a higher depreciation cost. Again, my depreciation as a percent of revenue, looks like it stays in a nice, healthy range. It's the unit cost penalty associated with the ramping 4 big 22-nanometer factories. Again, those are big factories and the first wafers off the line are pretty expensive. And so that will cause a little bit of an offset to the good news that I expect that we're going to see based on start-up costs and the higher platform revenue.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with JPMorgan.
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Just one more question on revenues. So if I try and get to the high single-digit revenue growth that you guys have guided for this year, even assuming some of that inventory correction comes back into sales, it's still, I think, like several billion dollar jump above normal seasonality in the second half. So I mean do you -- how do we get there? Do you guys expect tablets and phones? Do you expect further price increases? Can you just maybe take us through that?
Stacy J. Smith
Yes, I know. So I think if you're pointing to that we have a nonseasonal unit forecasting, the answer is yes, for the reasons Paul said. And again, based on what we've seen so far, sales of PCs look to be pretty seasonal. We think what's going to happen is the industry is going have to go through some kind of extraordinary measures to make sure PCs are getting to the right place to be sold, with very low inventory levels out there, and that pipeline starts to refill in Q2 and causes us to have more of our units in the back half. This isn't predicated on us magically winning half of the phone market. We're super excited to get those first products in the market, as Paul said, they have critical acclaim, but they don't move the needle from the standpoint of revenue or profit this the year. This is a year where we're going to get on there and fight and win designs.
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Great. And for my follow-up, just on spending, both R&D and CapEx, it is going up more than sales growth this year. Do you think that formalizes in 2013, i.e., it comes back in line? Or is this something that we should maybe get used to?
Stacy J. Smith
You're going to ask if Paul and I are going to spend like drunken sailors or not? We're above model in 2012. We'll come back down towards model over time...
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
On spending?
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
On spending, yes. So spending as a percent of revenue will come up in 2012 and we expect it'll come down over time. If you deconstruct what we're doing in 2012, my opinion is we're making some significant but prudent incremental investments in some critical areas. We made a lot of progress in terms of where we are with Ultrabooks, where we are with phones and tablets. We're going to make some investments there. In addition, we're making some investments in our Server business. You've seen us moving our product line from just focusing on servers to broader products in the Data Center that are focused on storage and communications and networking. You're going to see us continue to do that. And then underlying that, there's some core capabilities for the company around SoC integration, communications technology, security, process technology. We're going to make some investments there. So I think we'll come down from here. But this is an investment here for us in some areas where I think we got long-term shareholder return.

Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
Stacy, the platform costs seem like they're increasing less than I would have expected for this year. Can you talk a little bit about 22-nanometer yields? And do you think it will be similar to 32?
Stacy J. Smith
No, I'm not going to get into that level of detail. What we're seeing from a cost standpoint, as I said before, is pretty normal, as we're seeing the first wafers coming off. We have a very fast ramp of Ivy Bridge, strong demand, so that should give you some comfort. And we'll talk more about some of the longer-term trends when we get to the investor meeting.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
Okay. And as follow up, Paul, Android tablets sales seems like they are a disappointment last year, relative to what some were thinking at the beginning of 2011. And I'm just curious what you think the issue was last year and if there's reasons to be more optimistic about tablet sell-through this year?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, actually, they were about where I thought they would be, but I was well below what many of you had. I think the thing is, tablets are a little bit about hardware and an awful lot about software. And I think that until you get to Ice Cream Sandwich, the offering isn't as powerful as what's out there with Apple. And as the Ice Cream Sandwich tablets start shipping, I think you'll start seeing a little bit better receptivity, Google just added the music store, the videos are better, everything got a little bit better bit ICS. And so I think the better test is year 2 here, in terms of is there anyone that can compete with the iPad? And then the other part of that test, of course, is the Windows 8 tablets that are being queued up for production. So I don't know that the whole tablet thing is settled down by any stretch, and I do have a lot of interest in, if you heard me at CES about these hybrid and convertible designs as they apply to clamshells, where there's a significant blurring between what people do with tablets and what people do with PCs. So the jury is out on I think the long-term segmentation by form factor. But I do think you'll see more progress on the Android side as a result of ICS.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of CJ Muse with Barclays Capital.
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division
If I look at the incremental revenues you've guided to at high single-digits in your commentary about servers, I guess, made double-digit in PCs, I guess, low single-digit unit growth. It would suggest roughly $1 billion, $1.5 billion of incremental revenues from non-BCG, non-PCG. So curious if you could walk through what that the key contributors will be to that kind of growth.
Stacy J. Smith
No, CJ. We've given a lot in terms of annual revenue guidance and a lot in terms of what we expect from the standpoint of the different businesses. I'm not going to get more granular than that.
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division
All right. I guess, in terms of Server business, if you could walk through, I guess, linearity there. Are you seeing softness in Q1, given the Romley launch? And if so, how should we think about that through the year? Should that track similar to PCs in terms of back half loaded? Or should that see a nice bump up in Q2?
Stacy J. Smith
Again, I'm not going to get to that level of granularity on a prospective basis. We didn't see softness in the Server business in Q4. It may have jumped out at you that the year-over-year comp was down a little bit, it was 8% versus higher comps but if you go back to Q4 of last year, we had a Q4 of '10, we had an extraordinary strong quarter there. If I recall right, it was almost 30% growth from Q3 to Q4 of '10. So we're still seeing a nice, secular growth trend in servers and that's what we saw in Q4 and that's what we expect...
Paul S. Otellini
I would just add, CJ, that the Data Center business we have today is not your grandmother Server business that we had for many years, right? There's other elements in there around storage and networking equipment. And the other big element of that is the sales to the large Internet data centers that are being built up around the world. I think Stacy talked about that last quarter. Those sales were lumpy. They tend to be a function of when Facebook or Google or Amazon decides to turn on a new Data Center and they buy x 100,000 units. Or there's a new generation and they want to have a quick complete swap out. And as a result, we're seeing a change to the historical linearity that we saw in this -- in the enterprise Data Center business for many years. So I think you should probably get used to a little bit more lumpiness here and look at the overall year-on-year growth, which is what we've been trying to discuss at the last couple of analyst meetings.

Your next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri with CLSA Securities.
Srini Pajjuri - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division
Paul, couple of questions on the mobile side. You said as you enter the smartphone market more broadly, as you moved on to mid-end and low-end smartphones, you mentioned that it makes sense to integrate Medfield with the baseband that you had with Infineon. I'm just wondering what should we be thinking in terms of the timeframe for that solution. And also, as a follow-up, I'm just curious, given that all the smartphones also have Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS and then [ph]. Do you have that capability today internally? If not, what's your strategy for those components?
Paul S. Otellini
Yes, we've got the multi-comm capability in-house. A lot of that came with the acquisition from the Infineon group. And that's got 2G, 3G, they have an LTE solution underway. We've had Wi-Fi forever, and we've had Bluetooth for many years. So all of those are being integrated into our comms capabilities. In fact, we've integrated those business units now into a single unit to be able to accelerate that. I did not say, I want to be very clear, I did not say that our intent would be to integrate Medfield to baseband. I said over time, you'll see us move from the low-end baseband-only business in the feature phones and value phones to having it a more integrated capability. I didn't say when and what generation. I'm really not at liberty to discuss that. But the major thrust over the next year or 2 is going to be to have very high-performance modems as a comps processor and the best-of-class apps processors for smartphones.

Your final question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with Caris & Company.
Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division
Stacy, if you have the high-class problem, better units this year than PC Client in last year. What are the implications for CapEx?
Stacy J. Smith
So I hinted at it I think in the previous answer. If you look at the spending of CapEx for 2012, and this is consistent with what we said last year. It's a big component of it, but historically large component of it, is actually building the facilities, these 4 factory model that we've been talking about. We've got big construction projects underway. They start to taper off. From here, our CapEx, really, will be a function of 2 things: it's the unit growth that we see going forward, and it's the speed at which we bring capabilities to that leading-edge process technology. And I think graphics has been the classic example of that. As we move that to the process edged to the leading-edge process technology, it did drive an increase in CapEx but it also drove a really capable product line that we got paid for. So we balance off those decisions as we go forward. A big increase in units would say that we'll continue to spend CapEx to support those units. If it's less than that, then CapEx is less. It becomes a pretty -- a more traditional relationship going forward.
Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division
Okay. That's helpful. And then secondly, as we look at the balance sheet and the capital structure, you've taken on some debt in the fourth quarter. Can you frame for us, is that about the right level, a comfortable level for you? Are you capable of taking on more debt? Did  you look for potentially flexibility to buy back more stock, et cetera, in 2012?
Stacy J. Smith
Well, let me separate out those quarters. At the end of this, I'm not going to make a prospective statement on buybacks or debt. But our balance sheet certainly supports us taking on more debt. We have a relatively low amount of debt for a company of our size. So if we had a strategic need or decided that we wanted to take on more debt to buy back stock and recapitalize the company, we certainly have the capability of doing so. I'll come back to our capital structure philosophy. We've said in the past that our first priority is investing in our business. I think if you look at 2011, it's a perfect example of that, we've made some significant investments in research and development in CapEx. We bought it, we bought back and we bought the Infineon Wireless division that we believe bring really important capabilities, as well as nice business models into the company. Second priority is the dividend. We had a pretty significant increase in the dividend in 2011, and we've increased the amount of dividend as a percent of free cash flow in terms of our target. And we're kind of right in there now. And then third is buying back stock and you saw us do a pretty significant amount of stock buyback. We did take advantage in 2011 of fairly low interest rates and high dividend yields to accelerate that some,  and it probably didn't escape you noticed that we bought back $4.1 billion in the fourth quarter, which I think is probably our largest quarter of buybacks ever. So all that's true. I'm not going to talk prospectively, though, about more debt or the size of the buyback. That's not how we do it.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Quarter 3 2011 Intel Corporation's Earnings Conference Call. My name is Misty, and I'll be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.
I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Kevin Sellers, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
R. Kevin Sellers
Thank you, Misty, and welcome, everyone, to Intel's Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. By now, you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with that. If you've not received both documents, they're currently available on our Investor website, intc.com. I'm joined today by Paul Otellini, our President and CEO; and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them followed by the normal Q&A.
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and, as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Also if during this call we use any non-GAAP financial measures or references, we'll post the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliations to our website, intc.com.
So with that, now let me hand it over to Paul.
Paul S. Otellini
Thanks, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. I am very pleased to report another very strong quarter for the company with the highest quarterly revenue, earnings, earnings per share and microprocessor unit shipments in Intel's history. In particular, we were very pleased with the momentum in our notebook PC business and consumer demand for our industry-leading second-generation Intel Core processor family. Relative to the third quarter of last year, our notebook business saw double-digit unit growth, leading to record microprocessor unit volume and revenue.
Trends inside the quarter played out largely as we expected. While consumer demand in mature markets like Western Europe and North America remained soft, Enterprise PC demand remained strong and consumer demand in emerging markets continued to rise year-over-year. China was up 12%, India 21%, Turkey 14% and Indonesia 23%.
The Global PC landscape is being reshaped. Emerging markets now represent 2 of the top 3 consumption PC markets in the world. China is now the #1 PC consumption market in the world, while Brazil has become #3.
In total, we grew the business by 28%, adding more than $3 billion in quarterly revenue year-on-year. Even excluding the acquisitions of McAfee and Intel Mobile Communications, revenue grew by a full 18% over our Q3 2010 results, which were a record at the time. We have now had 6 consecutive record revenue quarters, and our financial performance is allowing us to return significant cash to our owners via both dividends and buybacks. Our investments to expand our capabilities and create long-term opportunities across the computing continuum are already paying off. Let me give you a few examples.
The Data Center continues to be a key source of growth, with revenues up 15% year-on-year in Q3. During the third quarter, the Data Center business also set an all-time record for storage units. We also announced that our Sandy Bridge-based 2 socket server product, code-named Romley, is shipping for revenue. Demand for Romley is forecasted to be 20x that of Nehalem at the same point of its life cycle, and we expect to launch early next year with almost 2x the design wins Nehalem had at its launch. In addition, we closed our acquisition of Fulcrum Systems, an ethernet switch silicon provider. The deal advances our strategy to deliver comprehensive building blocks across the Data Center from servers to storage and networking.
Turning to mobile computing. At IDF, we were proud to announce an extension of the long-standing collaboration between Intel and Google, which will enable time-to-market optimization of Android on Intel architecture. Work on Medfield-based smartphones and tablet designs continues, and we remain on track for Medfield-based devices to launch in the first half of next year.
I'd like to give a short update on our acquisitions. McAfee and Intel Mobile Communications, for example, contributed revenues of $1.1 billion in the third quarter. Sampling is imminent for Intel Mobile Communications' LTE product, and earlier today, McAfee launched Deep Defender. This groundbreaking new security product is the first fruit of the collaboration between Intel and McAfee.
In PCs, we are beginning to see the first generation of Ultrabooks come to market for the holiday selling season. Industry and consumer interest in Ultrabooks is high, and these early designs offer compelling, thin and light form factors with instant on capability, enhanced security and excellent battery life starting at less than $1,000. And yet, this is just the beginning. Over the next 2 generations, we expect that Ultrabooks will evolve to include features like touch screens and an always-on, always-connected capability, all at mainstream price points, offering a truly exceptional PC experience. With more than 70 designs in the pipeline, we are excited about the future of Ultrabooks.
During the third quarter, we began volume production of Ivy Bridge on our 22 nanometer process technology. 22 nanometers will usher-in the era of 3-D transistors, which will pay dividends in power, performance and density for generations to come. The midpoint of our outlook for the quarter puts us on pace to deliver nearly $55 billion in revenue for 2011, after crossing $40 billion for the first time in 2010, representing a year-over-year increase of 26% or more than $11 billion.
In closing, we are very pleased with the results and accomplishments of this record-setting quarter and year-to-date. We remain very confident in our growth strategy and are excited about our new product pipeline.
With that, let me turn the meeting over to Stacy.
Stacy J. Smith
Thanks, Paul. Revenue in the third quarter was a record, and it was our most profitable quarter ever. You can see the growth of our business by looking at a year-to-date comparison versus 2010. At the end of the third quarter, our revenue of $40.1 billion is $7.9 billion higher than the corresponding first 3 quarters of last year.
Third quarter revenue of over $14 billion is up over $3 billion when compared to the third quarter of 2010, equating to 28% growth year-on-year. McAfee and the Intel Mobile Communications Group contributed $1.1 billion of the $3.1 billion increase from a year ago.
Intel-owned inventories were slightly down from the second quarter. As we look more broadly at the worldwide PC supply chain, we believe inventories stayed at healthy levels and continue to be tightly managed by our customers.
Gross margin in the third quarter was 63%, up nearly 3 points from the second quarter. As expected, gross margin benefited from seasonally higher volume, lower unit costs as we ramped 32 nanometer factories, lower factory startup costs as we started 22 nanometer production and lower charges related to the Cougar Point product issue from earlier in the year.
Across all measures of profit, the third quarter was our best ever. Operating income of $4.8 billion was 34% of revenue, up over 3 points from the second quarter. Third quarter net income of $3.5 billion and earnings per share of $0.65 are up 17% and 25% respectively from a year ago. After excluding acquisition-related accounting impacts, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.69 was up 1/3 from a year ago.
In 2011, we have increased our employment by approximately 17,000 people, driven by acquisitions and hiring in research and development and manufacturing. And while business levels remain strong, the uncertainty around 2012 GDP growth rates has caused us a slow hiring for the rest of this year. As a result of this, our R&D and MG&A for the third quarter came in $150 million lower than the outlook we gave in July, reducing our spending as a percent of revenue to 29%.
As we look forward to the fourth quarter of 2011, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range of $14.7 billion. Year-over-year revenue growth is expected to remain strong, growing 28% from the fourth quarter of 2010. The midpoint of the fourth quarter range is up 3% from the third quarter, lower than average historical seasonality based on concerns about economic growth in Europe.
We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range to be up a couple of points from the third quarter at 65% as a result of higher volume, lower unit costs and lower startup costs. The fourth quarter gross margin forecast assumes a late quarter qualification for sale of Ivy Bridge, our first product on 22 nanometer.
The cash generation of our business remains strong, and in fact, increased significantly in the third quarter, with record cash flow from operations of $6.3 billion. Over the course of the year, we have made both significant investments in our business and have systematically increased the return of cash to our shareholders via increases in the amount of free cash flow we allocate to the dividend and via buybacks. Additionally, in the third quarter, we took advantage of record-low interest rates and borrowed $5 billion, primarily for the purpose of repurchasing stock. This was one of those rare opportunities where the weighted average after-tax cost of the debt was approximately 1/2 that of our dividend yield on the date of issuance.
Total cash investments ended the quarter at $15.2 billion, up $3.7 billion from the second quarter. So far this year, we have generated over $14 billion in cash from operations, paid approximately $3 billion in dividends, purchased nearly $8 billion in capital assets and repurchased $10 billion in stock.
Since restarting our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter of 2010, we have purchased over 500 million shares and reduced diluted shares outstanding by over 350 million shares. Additionally, we're announcing today that our Board of Directors has approved a $10 billion increase to the authorization limit for share repurchases.
The third quarter results illustrate several of the business drivers that we articulated at our investor meeting in May. Emerging markets are growing as a result of increased affordability of the technology that we sell. Our Notebook business saw strong unit growth at a very healthy mix. Our enterprise business continues to grow rapidly and generate high returns as data centers are built to support the explosion of devices that are computing and connecting to the Internet. The integration of both the Intel Mobile Communications Group and McAfee went well. Each had strong quarters and offered new opportunities to differentiate our core business as well as grow in new areas. And lastly, we are generating increasing shareholder return via increases in our dividend and we are contributing to record earnings per share via our buybacks. These trends have us on track to achieve record revenue and record profit in 2011.
And with that, let me turn it back over to Kevin.
R. Kevin Sellers
Okay. Thank you, Stacy and Paul. We'll now move to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Before we poll our first questioner, Stacy has a brief announcement that he would like to make.
Paul S. Otellini
Yes. Before we begin the Q&A, I want to announce the change in our Investor Relations team here at Intel. When Kevin started in the role of Director of Investor Relations nearly 5 years ago, I told him he couldn't leave until our revenue was over $50 billion. Our revenue is on track to $55 billion this year, so it's time to announce that Kevin will be moving into a new role in marketing, where he'll be responsible for global advertising, online marketing and corporate events for the company. Therefore, I'm pleased to announce that Mark Henninger is taking over the role of Director of Investor Relations. Mark is known by many of you already and brings over 15 years of Intel experience with over 3 years of IR experience to the position. Of note, I'd like to say that I plan to hold Mark to the same standard as Kevin, which means that he can't leave the role until we're up another 55% and hit $85 billion in revenue.
With that, I'd like to thank Kevin for his leadership and welcome Mark to the role. We will now have Mark take us through the Q&A portion of the meeting.
Mark Henninger 
Great. Thank you, Stacy. Operator, if you can go ahead and pool the line and introduce our first questioner.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Uche Orji with UBS.
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
First of all, Paul, let me ask you, ASPs have been stable so far, and as you start to look to drive Ultrabooks, is there any likelihood that this might be something that may -- you might have concede on as a way to drive that market, and obviously because a pushback in Ultrabook [indiscernible] on pricing, even at $1,000, do you think that is enough demand to drive this or do you have to make some concessions to drive the penetration?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, there are a couple of things. But the short answer to your question is that everything we envision for Ultrabook presumes that this happens at mainstream price points. Right? And so we don't think that people are going to spend more money on average for computers tomorrow than they spend today. So that's built into our model. Having said that, when you look at where Ultrabooks are this holiday season, they're in the $899, to $1,000, maybe $1,100 at the high end some of them. I think a year from now, you'll see them at, say, $699 and up. And at those price points, that there's plenty of room for Intel's Core Processor family to be in there. Second of all, as the form factor comes down, Intel's built-in materials in these Ultrabooks has a chance to go up, integrated graphics is used more often that not, solid-state drives will be used more often that not. And then the third point I'd make is around the ecosystem. Today, thin costs more. And so a lot of the components, not necessarily chips, but other things like the touchscreens or the batteries or the low-profile hard drives or solid-state drives cost a little bit more. And so what Intel's $300 million Ultrabook fund is aimed at is really accelerating the volume price points through volume commitments and investments for those components such that the industry can't collectively hit those price points. So I think that we've really thought this through in terms of how to get volume and profitably at the same time.
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Just a quick follow-up. In terms of all the events happening in Thailand now and the comments from the [indiscernible] manufacturers, what is your sense as to what impact this will have on the PC supply chain? Obviously, I know it's early days, but do you have any thoughts you can share with us on how this may affect your guidance for the fourth quarter?
Stacy J. Smith
Yes. This is Stacy, Uche. We don't think it's going to have an impact on the PC market sales in the fourth quarter. Their combination of alternate supplies and inventory levels will carry us through.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.
Mark Lipacis - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division
The question is most semiconductor companies are cutting their forecast and your 3Q is pretty close to seasonal, if not better. What do you think is going on? Are you gaining share from AMD? Are you gaining share of silicon content in the PC? Is this just what we should expect for an organic growth in PCs? Any clarification there would be helpful.
Stacy J. Smith
This is Stacy. I think it's really a continuation of the trends that we've been talking about. The emerging market demand was strong across the board. The Enterprise segment of the business was strong and it offset slower sales in the mature market consumer segment of the market. To your question on share gain with AMD, we'll wait and see their results. Our sense is we may have picked up a little bit of revenue share at the end of the quarter. But just to quantify that, I think it was probably on the order of $50 million to $100 million of impact to our business. I think the broader impact there is the leading-edge process technology becomes more and more complex, and we believe, becomes more of a competitive differentiator going forward. And not just with AMD, we're seeing this across-the-board. We're solving these problems a full generation ahead of everybody else. They're very difficult problems to solve. By being ahead of the rest in the industry, we can bring more features, more performance, bring cost down, be more power efficient. I think that has been a big driver of our business, and I think it will continue to be so.
Mark Lipacis - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division
That's a great set-up for the follow-up question, which is there's a debate about x86 versus ARM in mobile and notebook processors. And I guess, if you could just share with us your view on the important vectors to compare x86 or Medfield or whatever the proper processor name for you guys is versus ARM, and when should we expect to see you guys shipping x86 into volume handsets?
Paul S. Otellini
Sure. Well, the short answer to your question, the last part of your question, is what I said earlier, which is you'll see Intel-based phones in the first half of next year from a variety of suppliers. And we won't make any announcements until those phones are ready to be shown in public. But the other answer to your question is that there is -- just like there's no one ARM, there's no one version of Atom going into these devices. We have -- Intel has tailored Atom for low-end PCs, it's now tailoring it for tablets. We're tailoring different versions of it for handsets and cellphones, and other versions for embedded and automotive implementations. And the ARM guys have done a lot of that in the past with different derivatives of their products. As the need for computing performance goes up, both the Intel architecture and the ARM architectures face the same fundamental physics problems, which is more performance requires more transistors. So at the end of the day, to deliver multi-core performance, better graphics performance in a battery-constrained environment is going to be a function of the transistors more than the microarchitecture. And that's where Stacy's comments on our transistor advantage, today and going forward, become critically important in understanding how this will play out.
Stacy J. Smith
Okay. Mark, let me just -- let me also add to that. I hear this argument a lot about ARM coming into the PC segment of the market, and the way I hear it articulated from some of our competitors is they're talking about they're going to come into that segment of the market, which is the low -- very low end of the PC market with a $30 processor to compete against our $100 processor and therefore, they win. I think if you look at the low end of the market today, it's pretty instructive. We're there today with $30 processors where we make a very good product margin on, actually, $30 kits in that segment of the market. AMD, our prime competitor, is in there, well under our pricing. They're selling at a $20-kit pricing. We still win the lion share of that market, and we win the lion share of that market because we bring more performance, we bring features, we're a reliable supplier, we have high quality levels. All of the benefits of doing business with Intel shine through there. It's going to be the same issue with ARM. All of those advantages will be even more so against ARM. And with AMD, they're socket and application compatible. With ARM, they're not. And so the cost and the complexity to our consumers is quite a bit higher. So I'm really confident in our play in that space. And as Paul said, at the end, it all comes down to we're solving these problems of physics 2 years ahead of the rest of the industry, that gives us a cause-to-performance a future advantage that become very difficult for people to match.

Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Barclays Capital.
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division
I guess, first question, in terms of your revenue guide up 3% sequentially at the midpoint, can you help me understand kind of the moving parts there? What's outperforming, what's underperforming within your various segments?
Stacy J. Smith
Sure. I'd be happy to. So first, I want to put that in perspective. It's 28% revenue growth year-on-year off of the back of a strong 2010. 2010 was a strong year for us. But you would look at the 3% and say against a kind of wide range of seasonal outcomes, that's kind of at the lower end or below the seasonal average. When you deconstruct what's going on, I think that we're a little cautious on Q4 based on, as I said in my prepared remarks, just macroeconomic concerns, particularly in Europe. And you have to remember that Q4 is a very strong consumer quarter and that has been a section of the market that has been sluggish really all year. So that's one. We're hearing from our customers that they're going to manage inventory to very lean levels, supply chain inventory very lean levels. So that also is, I think, a little bit of a headwind, assuming that in-demand ends up where we're predicting it to be. And then third, our IMC business, Intel Mobile Communications group, is down a bit. We have one key customer that's moved to a multi-source strategy. By the way, we knew that when we did the deal, but it's now coming to fruition, and so they'll be down a couple of hundred million dollars as we go from very a strong Q3 to Q4.
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division
And I guess, as my follow-up, in terms of CapEx, your budget is unchanged this year, and I think you've made sort of some internal changes as you think about cutting your 1270, 1272 roadmaps. And I guess my question there is, are you pulling in the 1272 so that, that will actually come in faster? Is that still on track for where you thought it would be 6, 9 months ago?
Stacy J. Smith
It's on track to where we thought it was 6 to 9 months ago. And remember, the capital we're spending this year is kind of 22 nanometer peak, it's the front edge of 14 nanometer, it's putting in place the space to support the fact that we're now a $55 billion business that's growing. So the kind of short-term movements don't really impact the capital budget. But to your question, 20 nanometer is similar to what we have believed all year.

Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
And I guess as my first question, Paul, can you talk a little bit about DCG? A lot of buckets within that. What's been kind of outperforming versus kind of underperforming? And as you think about maybe that maintaining at 15% top line year-over-year growth rate, you kind of had been flat here for the last couple of quarters. What's the drive to kind of the next leg of growth there?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, I think there's 3 elements of the business. There's the classic enterprise data center, which has been going through a sort of secular consolidation over several years now, starting with Nehalem, where people are moving from older generations of 1 and 2P servers to MP virtualized machines. And that, we've only begun to see the impact of that and some of the early hints on Romley that I talked about are indicative of the upside we still have in corporate enterprise data centers. The second big clump is in the Internet data centers. And those -- that growth rate, which is basically tracking the cloud growth rate, is really quite strong. Those customers tend to buy in a more lumpy pattern, around our best technology. So you might imagine that some of those large customers may be waiting for our next generation products to be deployed, which are being shipped now, but they'll start deploying in the next several months. And then the third one is in things around servers in the data center, networking and enterprise, and those businesses have been quite strong. You saw EMC's announcement this morning and our announcement that we had a record quarter in storage. There's really no difference in that. People are adding storage capacity as fast as they're having cloud computing capacity because they go hand and glove. I think that the biggest issue relative to the quarterly trends is probably this lumpiness in the Internet data centers.
Stacy J. Smith
I was surprised when I looked at the data -- John just said, give a little more color on that, how quickly these guys convert to our newest technology. We looked back at Westmere, and what we saw is in the first 90 days, they converted, that 90% of our sales to them we're on the new technology. And so as Paul said, I think we saw a little bit of a stall in Q3 as they were waiting for the Sandy Bridge version, and that's now telling for revenue and we're seeing acceleration in the business. So I think that skews those quarterly results somewhat.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
That's helpful. And then as my follow-up, Stacy, you gave us ASPs at the platform level. I'm kind of curious when you look within the PC client group, with MPU revenue up 15% versus chipset up 6% sequentially, can you help me understand on the MPU side, what was unit driven versus ASP and are you benefiting as you're tucking in integrated graphics? And how do we think about that going forward?
Stacy J. Smith
Yes, so first of all, it becomes increasingly difficult, if not misleading to try to separate out the CPU from the chipset. We're selling this as a platform of capabilities. And so I think that the most intellectually honest way for us to talk about it is at a platform level. In terms of what drove the Q3 results, it was really all units. Quarter-on-quarter pricing was relatively flat. It was a unit-driven story. We saw double-digit growth across PC units, and notebooks were notably stronger than the average.

Your next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra with Robert W. Baird.
Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
Could you talk about the assumption that's built around Ultrabooks in your Q4 guidance? Is it material?
Paul S. Otellini
No, it's not.
Stacy J. Smith
Yes, from a revenue standpoint, no.
Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
And also you've previously talked about the expectation of say lower cost of sales outlook for next year. Assuming stable ASPs, you've mentioned several times now multiple design wins in mobile phone. Does that lead us to change any ASP assumption potentially for next year?
Paul S. Otellini
I'm not sure I understood the question. Are you talking about an average between our client ASP and phones? Is that where you're heading?
Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
Well, whether the ASP outlook could change next year on the basis of your mix and, of course, this having some derivatives regarding your gross margin outlook.
Stacy J. Smith
Yes. I'll provide an ASP forecast to you in January for 2012. If you go back to the stuff from the investor meeting, what I showed was we've upped the range and I'm pretty confident that we're in the top half of the range in 2012, that hasn't changed, which is 60% to 65% or so.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Danely with JPMorgan.
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
In terms of the Q4 forecast, how much of the below seasonal sales would you say is due to just an inventory drawdown versus softening demand? And then any commentary from your customers on the demand environment would be great as well.
Stacy J. Smith
Yes, we don't think that there's an inventory drawdown. We ended Q3 lean and they all continue to be lean. So, I guess, what articulated is I think we're a bit below -- when I say we, the worldwide PC supply chain, kind of a bit below model today. It's healthy to lean, and we don't think that they're going to grow inventory levels in the fourth quarter.
Paul S. Otellini
Let me just add on customers as a development. Let me add something you didn't ask, but wanted to color my comments, which is the shape of Q3. And as we went through Q3, we saw September being very strong. So we didn't see a tail off at all in the third quarter. In terms of customer forecast, it's really -- it's an interesting dynamic that they are, obviously, moving very rapidly around the enterprise sales, but everyone is cautious around consumer sales, particularly in the U.S. and Western Europe. And not less so obviously in emerging markets. The other dynamic that's here is that there seems to be an adequate supply of components to build, in particular, laptops. So screens, power supplies, hard drives, all the stuff that a quarter ago was a little empty because of the tsunami, seems to be in more than adequate supply. At the same time, for other reasons, macroeconomic reasons, it's now cheaper to ship by air than it was in prior quarters. So our customers have more flexibility on the upside for taking turns environment should they see opportunity over the course of this quarter than we've seen in a couple of quarters. And so I think what you've got is them just staging to be cautious and not get caught on the downside with inventory, but to be ready to pounce on any upside opportunity.
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
And for my follow-up, I'll completely switch gears. This year, you guys have really made a statement through increasing the dividend and the buyback. If you could just maybe talk about sort of what drove that change? And then also any sort of metrics you look at as far as how you allocate cash either way and what is your sort of long-term goal for cash at Intel versus debt level? Anything like that would be helpful.
Stacy J. Smith
Yes, I'll take a shot and forgive me in advance. We tend to not talk about the level of cash that we're targeting, nor do we talk about, on a prospective basis, buybacks. But I'll go back and talk about our strategy and put it in place. I think you're right. You have identified, we -- between Paul and I and the Board have had robust conversations, made a very conscious decision to prioritize and articulate the strategy of what we're going to do with cash. And as I've said before, it's first and foremost invest in our business. You can see we're doing that in areas where we think we get tremendous value, it's leading-edge process technology, it's buying companies like McAfee and IMC where we think we generate important differentiated capabilities. Second is the dividend. And I will try to be very explicit that we are allocating more of our free cash flow to the dividend, and what I said at the investor meeting is that I'm targeting something on the order of 40% of free cash flow via dividend payout. And then we continue to use the buyback then as the third way that we return cash to shareholders and the combination of generating a lot of cash in 2011 and the fact that we were bringing down our cash balances sum from where they were to where they are, led to a pretty significant buyback to date. And I'm sure it didn't escape your notice that we also announced today that the Board has authorized, at Paul's and my request, another $10 billion buyback authorization.

Your next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung with Citigroup.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
Now that emerging markets is becoming an increasing part of your business, can you talk about the changes we may expect to see in the next, call it, 4 to 8 quarters in terms of mix and form factor, but also in terms of new product uptake and the kind of visibility that you get from the emerging markets?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, there's about 3 variants of that. So in terms of mix and uptake of new products, in the last 4, 5 years, the emerging markets, at least, have not behaved materially different than our mature markets. That is the Tier 1 cities in China or Brazil tend to buy essentially the same products that you buy in Tier 1 cities of North America or Europe. And there's a very rich mix of products. In fact, for a while China was actually a richer mix than the United States on average. But now we're seeing Tier 3, Tier 4 cities come on. So that's being mitigated a bit. In terms of being able to have visibility, I think the visibility is as good, if not better. In these markets, there is still a reasonably large amount of the business that is still desktop and that is distribution related. And that business, we have almost realtime a visibility into because we don't recognize revenue until a unit is sold out of distribution, which means it goes into a PC, being built that day basically. So I like our visibility in these markets, I like the buying pattern, and I like the rich mix and I like, obviously, the upside opportunity of new buyers.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
Second question is on Ultrabook. The commentary often centers around what's ARM going to do to Intel next year. But by the same token, do you think that Ultrabook stimulates overall PC growth to maybe be above what we would have expected without Ultrabook and does that growth, even if ARM takes some share, offset any potential they may have?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, I would hope so. And I think there's a couple of things next year that are intriguing.  One is the growth of Ultrabook, and the other is a new release of Windows. And historically, a new release of Windows has benefited Intel nicely. I think that we -- while there is certainly some possibility of ARM incursion into PC space, I think it's going to be minimal for the reasons that Stacy said earlier. I actually look at it the other way around, which is to date, our presence in tablets has not been that large. With Windows 8, you have a monolithic operating system across PCs and tablets that Intel can participate in and bring in the advantage of legacy support for applications and device drivers. And in that dynamic, I think we have, net, more upside than downside.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of James Covello with Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
In terms of the market, you guys have given us a great articulation of why your business is growing so much faster than the third-party data suggests, and I think a lot of that is the emerging markets that you guys have been very helpful in, in allowing us to understand. What I don't understand as easily is your business versus the other component companies that theoretically should sell into those same emerging markets: DRAM, panels, power management, hard disk drives. I mean, all of those things also would sell into those same emerging markets. So can you give us a little bit of perspective on why your business is so much better than theirs?
Paul S. Otellini
At the end of the day, it can't be. For every laptop, there's a chip and a panel. There is a bit higher fraction of desktops in emerging markets, but not so much that we would throw the data off along the line that you're suggesting. My sense is that -- those industries are far less concentrated. And so it's probably harder for the third-party to get their arms around the dynamics, particularly as there may be some differential quality going into parts selection to some of these markets. People may sell their off-spec panels into cheaper notebooks going into some of these markets, or off-spec memory and things like that. I don't know that that's a big factor, but it's the only thing that comes to mind in trying to explain that economy.
Stacy J. Smith
It might also be, and I'm speculating here, but we have seen people manage inventory levels on CPUs very low. And so it's possible that what you see as inventory builds up on something, there's a correction here, a correction there, whereas with CPUs because of hubs and the cost of the CPU relative to the overall system, we get more realtime sales. But that's speculation, Jim. At the end of the day, as Paul said, over time, they have to match.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
That's helpful. And for my follow-up, if I could ask, can you guys give us an estimate on how much unit capacity might increase in 2012 and then when that capacity ramp would start vis-à-vis the new fab coming online?
Paul S. Otellini
Yes, I'll provide a forecast for 2012 in January, Jim. I'm not going to go there yet.

Your next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo.
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
When might we expect the launch of your 32 nanometer chip for Android tablets? I guess that's close with you?
Stacy J. Smith
No, 32 nanometer is Medfield and...
Paul S. Otellini
The tablet. Yes, it's the Medfield core.
Stacy J. Smith
It's the Medfield core.
Paul S. Otellini
Yes, you'll see those shipping at first half next year.
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
And the other thing is that you talked about a stall in Q3 waiting for Sandy Bridge for storage and Internet data centers. So similarly, do you expect a jump in server processor sales in the first half of next year when Romley-based enterprise servers start shipping?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, I gave you my -- the pent-up metrics for Romley, and that's about as far as we can go. I mean, we're 20x the kind of design activity and 2x or 3x the backlog activity of Nehalem.
Stacy J. Smith
Yes. I think it would be safe to say a rapid start for Romley. The question is macroeconomic and we'll provide that.
Paul S. Otellini
But we have mobile versions of the Sandy Bridge server products. So they all start phasing in over the next several months.
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
My final thing, when might we expect the first PCs with Ivy Bridge chips to be on shelves?
Paul S. Otellini

Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Now my question, Paul, a number of foundries seem to be struggling at the 28 nanometer node, and obviously, one of Intel's strengths is in process and manufacturing in your roadmap at 22 nanometer and then 14 nanometer. I'm curious, how is that benefiting your discussion with potential tablet and smartphone customers about long-term relationships? Any color would be helpful.
Paul S. Otellini
Well, as you can imagine, it only helps having those conversations. And I said earlier, I think at the end of the day in these markets, transistors are going to be a defining point of differentiation. And when we look at these long-term customers in this area, people making long-term design commitments, the fact that we're operating at 22 today and have great line of sight to 14, and they see our internal roadmaps on what we can do on System on Chip at those 2 generations, it becomes pretty compelling. And I understand the proof's in the pudding here so to some extent you're going to have to wait until we bring a phone up on stage and run it through its paces and bring a tablet up on stage and run it through its paces vis-à-vis the competition to be able to be convinced to this.
Arnab K. Chanda - Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division
And one follow-up for Stacy. Stacy, Q3 gross margins were a tad below the expectations. I think the benefits of the 22 nanometer startup cost declines are not as quickly as I think you had previously hoped. What is behind that? And just in sort of a related question, do you expect any additional startup cost as you start thinking about SoC's next year?
Stacy J. Smith
Yes. So let me just take you -- let me do the Q3 gross margin walk. It wasn't exactly as you stated. I caught several small things. But we had anticipated that we would get benefit from higher volume, lower unit cost, lower startup cost and less impact associated with the Cougar Point product issue that we've had in the first half. We got all of that. We got a point for volume, we got a point for unit cost, we got about 0.5 point for startup cost, 0.5 point of having less Cougar Point. When I go back to the forecast I made, you probably had 3 things that moved in different directions. We got a little more good news than I expected on product cost. I got a little less good news than I expected on startup costs and Cougar Point. None of those were equal to 0.5 point of gross margin. So they're all relatively small, and the combination of them just caused me to round down. So it's kind of as simple as that. In terms of impact of 22 nanometer SoC startup cost, I struggle to answer that question a little bit. We have startup costs all the time. As I've shown in the past, we have a baseline of startup costs and then when we're launching a new process technology, which is for us odd years, you tend to see an elevation in those startup costs. So that hasn't changed. I'd expect startup costs to be less next year, and then they'll elevate again in 2013 as we're starting to bring 14 nanometer to the marketplace. And SoCs don't change that equation for me.
Mark Henninger

Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Stanford Bernstein.
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
A question on your guidance, particularly weakness in Europe. What does your European strength look like this quarter, at least from an end-market standpoint? I was actually kind of surprised that your direct sales into Europe were up 16%. But I find it hard to believe, that I guess your total end-market demand in Europe was hugely strong this quarter. And do you expect it to be significantly weaker in Q4 versus Q3, which is driving, I guess, the full amount of the sub-seasonal guidance? Or what does this actually imply, I guess, for outlook in other regions, particularly areas where you're currently seeing strength?
Stacy J. Smith
So first, Stacy, you have to separate out what we report to you as billings versus the strength of end markets. And remember, our billings data, as Paul was talking about earlier, will capture typically the channel sales, which is more desktop-oriented -- actually it's almost all desktop-oriented, and it captures server builds, which sometimes are done inside the market. The rest are built by big MNCs, it tends to be build in either Taiwan or China, and then is shipped into Europe. And so our comment on weakness in Europe was more of an end-market comment based on mature market consumer that does intend to be built inside of Europe. I'll pause there and pause for your other questions.
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
So what did your end-market demand in Europe actually look like in Q3 and how do you expect that to be different in Q4? Was your end-market demand in Europe significantly strong in Q3?
Stacy J. Smith
No, it was -- again, it paralleled the high-level comments. It was, for EMEA, it was strong in the emerging markets of EMEA. So central Eastern Europe, Middle East. For Enterprise, it was relatively good. We saw much slower growth in mature market consumer in EMEA and you'd say it was sub-seasonal growth in that segment. We would expect those trends to continue into Q4. The difference is in Q4, it is the big consumer selling season in Europe, and so the impact on our business is going to be bigger.
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
So you just had a stronger, I guess, enterprise demand across, which gave you very strong results versus your guidance this quarter, and the enterprise lift eases in Q4 and you get exposed to consumer weaknesses. Is that how I ought to be thinking about this?
Paul S. Otellini
We saw strong emerging markets and enterprise, we expect that to continue, so it doesn't lessen the differences, as Q4 is a much bigger consumer, mature market consumer selling season, which is why we're below season.
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
And for my follow-up, I just want to see if I can get a little color around your depreciation. So it looks like you took your depreciation guidance for the end of the year up from where it's been. And I would assume that is related to CapEx and among other things. Can you give us some feeling for where you expect, I guess, depreciation run rates to go in 2012 versus where they've been running for much of 2011 and maybe where they're running versus Q4?
Stacy J. Smith
Yes, I don't think we took our depreciation forecast up. I think we were right...
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
Was it 1.4 versus 1.3 or 1.2 the quarter before?
Stacy J. Smith
We may have a round that caused it to round from 1.3 to 1.4. But in essence, depreciation for the quarter and for the year is right on what we expected. And I'll provide a depreciation forecast for 2012 in January. I just looked at the data, there's no change, Stacy, to the depreciation forecast.

Your final question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
The first question, Paul, in 2011, the enterprise side of things and the demand was very strong, and the emerging markets were as well. As we look into 2012, especially giving Ultrabooks and potentially what Windows 8 is going to do, how should we think about the enterprise versus the consumer in aggregate and what that may or may not mean to Intel's mix, gross margin and ASPs?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, the overall pattern hasn't changed. Enterprise -- big business enterprise, as opposed to small, medium business, represents about 1/3 of our PC sales. And that hasn't changed. That's a large installed base. That installed base is not going to be an early adopter of Windows 8. Enterprise always adopts it after this first service pack is out, which will be sometime in 2013. So I think we've got another year of conversion to Windows 7 ahead of us. As you remember, it is still -- we're not even halfway through the XP and Windows 95 conversion to Win7 right now. So I think that will continue over the course of next year. People will buy machines that are, of course, Win8 ready in their buying patterns as they -- in enterprise next year. In terms of Ultrabook and Win 8, I just -- that really is a function of the health of the consumer market a year from now. And you've seen the same GDP forecast I have. I think it's too early to call that. I will point out that we have been pleasantly -- we've enjoyed good unit growth and good revenue growth the last couple of years in the middle of difficult economic times. And that really speaks to the nature of what our products do for people and businesses. They're tools of productivity. So even in bad times, we've done pretty well. So even if you have -- if you project another year of difficult GDP environment in the mature markets, I would think we could do equally as well, as we have the last couple of years here.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
And I guess then for my follow-up, changing gears completely, on the Atom side of things, down a bunch in this last quarter. How much of that is still Netbooks? And where should we think about that Atom revenue bottoming, and then how should we think about it going up as the embedded side of Atom starts to gain even further revenue traction versus the design win traction you've talked about before?
Stacy J. Smith
Yes, the quarter-on-quarter change is almost all Netbooks. Actually it is, the downward change is all Netbooks. In terms of your question about embedded, like others that play in the industrial and automotive segment of that market, we saw weak results in the third quarter. It's pretty clear there was an inventory overhang out there that people had to work through. When I dig in, in the Embedded business, the data we showed you in May, where we're looking at the design wins that we're engaged in, the design wins that have been won, the architectural conversions, if anything, it looks like we're accelerating in terms of conversions coming to us from MIPS or ARM to Atom. And so I think the long-term pieces of growth in that business is still intact.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Q2 2011 Intel Corporation's Earnings Call. My name is Chasity, and I'll be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Kevin Sellers, VP of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.

Thank you, Chasity, and welcome everyone to Intel's Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. By now, you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with that. If you've not received both documents, they're currently available on our investor website, intc.com. I'm joined today by Paul Otellini, our President and CEO; and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we will hear brief remarks from both of them followed by Q&A. 
I'd like to tell you about a change to our company's guidance and Quiet Period practices. Beginning this quarter, the company's Quiet Period will be reduced by 2 weeks to enable an extended period of dialogue with investors. Intel will observe the Quiet Period from September 16 until publication of the company's third quarter earnings release.
Additionally, certain of our smaller business outlook items, the forecast for amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, impact of equity investments and interest and other and tax rate, will be pulled from guidance at the close of business, July 26, and not subject to an update by the company after that time. 
We also want to make everyone aware of the annual Intel Developer Forum taking place September 13 through the 15 at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. In addition to keynotes from Paul and other senior leaders, we'll be beholding a number of investor briefings, and invite you to come and hope to see many of you there.
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and, as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. 
Also if during this call we use any non-GAAP financial measures or references, we will post the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliations to our website. So with that, let me hand it over to Paul.
Paul Otellini
Thanks, Kevin. I'm very pleased to report another record revenue quarter for the company. In May, we met with many of you at our annual investor meeting, and laid out our strategy and the opportunities we have before us. The transit of driving the growth of our business that we described then are playing out as expected. The Data Center business remains strong, our Embedded business is seeing rapid growth, the Enterprise PC refresh continues, and the emerging markets continue to be significant drivers of our broad based momentum.
In the comparison of our second quarter results versus Q2 of last year, we saw strong double-digit revenue growth across every business segment. For example, the Data Center business is up 15%; Embedded is up 25%; NAND is up 15%; and our PC Client business is up 11%. 
If we look at the channel, which is an excellent proxy for emerging markets strength, our channel revenue was up 17% versus last year. In summary, this was a very strong quarter across all of our product lines and around the world.
Now let me take just a moment and provide a bit of color on performance of our major business segments. The Data Center Group had another very strong quarter with CPU revenues topping the $2 billion mark for the third consecutive quarter. Demand for our Westmere-EX family that was launched in April is very healthy, and this helped to strengthen server ASPs in the quarter. 
At our Investor Day, we talked a lot about how the Data Center business was more than just servers. To highlight that, microprocessor unit shipments for storage applications set a record and we're up 38% from a year ago. Also, we grew our networking revenue 40% from a year ago. The non-server parts of our Data Center business are growing at an exceptional rate. 
As for servers, the story is much the same. The market remains very strong, with demand from Cloud-based customers leading the way. The Cloud segment is up 50% in the first half of 2011 versus the first half of last year, demonstrating how fast that business continues to ramp. We believe that we are very early in the Cloud build out, and that Intel remains extremely well-positioned to profitably grow from the explosion of Mobile devices and Internet-based services.
In our Embedded business segment, I mentioned that revenues grew 25% from a year ago on record microprocessor unit shipments. We shipped over 1 million units of Atom processors into embedded applications for the first time ever, which is an increase of 76% from a year ago. Overall, we witnessed very broad-based strength in our embedded segment, with the fastest growth coming from the Medical Imaging segment, up 50%; Print Imaging, up 48%; Communications, up 40%; and Industrial applications, up 20%. We're starting to see many of the long cycle design wins that we've been tracking, turn into revenue, and expect Q3 to continue this trend.
McAfee turned in a very solid quarter with revenue beating our expectations. It was a second quarter record for McAfee in terms of revenue. Additionally, the number of large deals signed was almost double that of Q1. McAfee is executing very well and the importance of security has never been more evident. We are excited that later this year, Intel and McAfee will be shipping the very first products codeveloped by both companies that will greatly enhance security for computing applications. 
This new solution is a combination of enhanced software from McAfee and security instructions built into the hardware from Intel. We look forward to providing more details of this product at our Developer Forum in September. 
Lastly, the PC Client Group also had a very good quarter. Demand for Sandy Bridge processors has been very strong, with the ramp rate of Sandy Bridge ahead of the previous generation products by 20%. Today, 2/3 of all the products that we ship into PC clients are Core i3, i5, or i7. 
Overall, the trends in PCs remain much the same as the last few quarters. The Corporate business remains consistent and healthy, consumer markets are mixed. The mature market consumer segment is still soft, but the emerging market consumer segment is healthy and growing. 
Our guidance for the third quarter assumes a modest growth in the mature market consumer segments of the business. At this point in the year, we believe the PC unit growth will be around 8% to 10%, down a bit from our earlier view, but above that in revenue as Enterprise PC purchases continue to drive a very rich mix.
I previously mentioned that our channel revenue was up 17% from a year ago. Let me add some color to our emerging market results. In looking at the last 3 months of reported PC shipments, you can see why we're so optimistic about the emerging market's opportunity. 
For example, Turkey and Indonesia are up over 70% each; India is up 17%; Russia is up 15%; and China is up 14%. The latest data on Latin America also showed growth of 12%. Brazil remains the key driver of this growth and is poised to become the third largest market for computers in 2012. In general, all of these are large, high growth regions, but PC penetration remains very low, while affordability of PCs continues to improve.
In closing, I want to highlight 2 important announcements made this quarter. The first was the process technology breakthrough that we made public back in May. Intel will be the first company to productize 3-D transistors. Our 22-nanometer process technology remains on track for high-volume production later this year, and will provide substantial improvements in power consumption and performance. This technology is very complex and very innovative, plus that we expect that the lead we have in process technology will expand going forward, providing Intel with important competitive advantages in the markets we're targeting. 
Second was the Ultrabook announcement we made at Computex. Ultrabooks are the next evolution in personal computing that will combine the best of the consumer PC with tablet functionality, as well as consumer electronics features like instant on, and always on, always connected functionality. All in a stylish, thin and light system. We are very pleased with the industry response and customer commitments around this new product category, and will provide more details at our September Development Forum. 
With that, let me turn the meeting over to Stacy.
Stacy Smith
Thanks, Paul. The second quarter was strong and better than expected, resulting in our first ever quarter with greater than $13 billion in revenue. From a market standpoint, the quarter played out as expected, with strength in emerging markets and enterprise, offset by softness in the mature market consumer segment. We continue to benefit from the strength of our product lineup, as mix within both servers and clients was better than expected. 
Demand for our latest product, Sandy Bridge, remained strong and is the fastest ramping product in our company's history. As a result of the acquisitions of McAfee and the Infineon Wireless division, we will provide non-GAAP financial information in addition to GAAP for 2011 to provide additional visibility into the operational results of the company. 
On a non-GAAP basis, we achieved record revenue of $13.1 billion. Gross margin of $8.1 billion was also a record for the gross margin of 62%. Operating profit of $4.2 billion was up 6% from a year ago. Net income of $3.2 billion and earnings per share of $0.59 were up 10% and 16%, respectively from a year ago. The rest of my comments will use GAAP financials unless otherwise called out.
Our business growth has accelerated over the past few years. Second quarter revenue of over $13 billion is up approximately $2.3 billion when compared to the second quarter of 2010, equating to 21% growth. The acquisitions of McAfee and the Infineon Wireless divisions contributed approximately $1 billion of the $2.3 billion increase from a year ago.
Gross margin in the second quarter was 61%, slightly down from the first quarter. As expected, our 22-nanometer startup cost peaked in the second quarter, and our costs were slightly higher as we ramped incremental factories on our 32 nanometer process technology. This was mostly offset by the reserves taken in the first quarter for the Cougar Point product issue, which were significantly less in the second quarter.
As we look forward to the third quarter of 2011, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $14 billion, up 7% for the second quarter and in line with historical seasonality. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range to be up from the second quarter at 64%.
We are raising the midpoint of our outlook for R&D and MG&A by $500 million to $16.2 billion. Some of this increase is due to a significant increase in our business. For the larger portion is driven by investments we are making in innovation to drive future revenue growth. Our investments are focused on redefining the PC category with Ultrabooks, our server product offerings, strengthening our product offering in tablets and phones and further extending our process technology leadership. 
Our long term goal here is to make these important investments that contribute to our growth, while still maintaining the progress we have made on efficiency and keeping spending as a percentage of revenue below 30%. 
The cash generation of our business remains strong, with cash flow from operations of $4 billion in the second quarter. On top of investing in our business, we are increasing the amount of free cash flow allocated to the dividend and actively repurchasing shares. Consistent with the philosophy we outlined in May. This was apparent in the second quarter, as we purchased $2.5 billion in capital and are forecasting CapEx of $10.5 billion for the year, completed a $2 billion buyback, and announced a 16% increase to our dividend.
Our Intel-owned inventory was approximately flat to the prior quarter and the inventory that sits at our distributors were down slightly this quarter. As we look more broadly at the worldwide PC supply chain, we believe inventories are at a healthy level and did not grow this quarter. 
As Paul mentioned, our business results in the second quarter continue to reinforce the key themes highlighted at our May Investor Meeting. The explosion of devices that compute and connect to the Internet continues to drive the buildout of the cloud and fuel our Data Center Group growth. 
Our Embedded business is growing at a rapid pace, as the demand for both performance and low-power from the Internet of things drives architectural conversions for Intel. 
Emerging markets already make up more than half of our revenue. And as the technology that we sell becomes more affordable to billions of consumers, we will continue to see robust growth from emerging markets. These are the market forces that drove first half revenue growth of 23% from the first half of 2010. And these are the market forces that give us confidence as we enter the second half of 2011. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Kevin.
R. Sellers
Okay. Thanks, Stacy and Paul. We'll now move to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Chasity, we'll take our first question.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG
Just a question on your total PC unit forecast that you're looking at. I guess, if you're not really looking for anything different than seasonal in your full year guidance appears to be about the same, how do we reconcile a weaker addressable markets to the fact that your guidance has not changed?
Paul Otellini
Well, our guidance is in revenue dollars. And I said pretty clearly that one of the things we're seeing is less strength in the netbook segment and a stronger strength in the overall mix of PCs. In fact, our PC Client business, notebooks and desktops, non-netbooks is running double digits.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG
And I guess, on that front, in the PC Client side of things, it looks like the core mix, it keeps rising. It's about 20%, I believe, of mixed now. How high do you think that can go and how long do you think it would take to get there?
Paul Otellini
Well, I think I said that 2/3 of our PC shipments were Core i3, i5, and i7. The branded portions of the product line. So the number is more than 20%. It's 66.5% [ph].
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG
My error, sorry.
Stacy Smith
Answering your question of, going forward, you can kind of see it in the gross margin recomp for Q3. We're expecting pricing to be relatively flat. It says kind of stable from here. So it surprises with our strength, but we believe that strength continues through this year.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Wang with Evercore.
Patrick Wang - Evercore Partners Inc.
I just want to see if you could maybe give us some milestones we should look for over the next couple of -- over the next quarter or so in terms of how your core business is growing in these emerging markets, geographies?
Paul Otellini
For the next quarter, I mean, the next milestone is our -- is 3 months from today.
Patrick Wang - Evercore Partners Inc.
Not specifically the next 3 months, but next few months. But just over the next couple of quarters here. Just maybe help us get a better sense of how to actually track the growth in those areas.
Paul Otellini
Well, I mean, there's no better way than understanding than putting feet on the street. To the extent that you have the opportunity to go, look at the -- I was just in Brazil. The fact that Brazil will become the third-largest country market in the world for computers next year is pretty astounding. It wasn't too long ago when they were number 6 or 7. And so it's the realtime dynamic of these markets waking up, increase in disposable income, a decrease in the cost of computing, a decrease in the cost of bandwidth and connectivity all coming together. And there's no one indicator I can point you to because as we've discussed before, some of this stuff is below the radar screen of some of the third-party trackers. But we see it realtime, because we've got a feet on the street and we're serving the market.
Stacy Smith
And I think you can see it -- where you see it pretty clearly is in our overall results. The emerging markets have been the big driver of incremental units over the last few years. Our prediction is that just continues as we go through the next few years.
Patrick Wang - Evercore Partners Inc.
That's helpful. And I know you guys have also shared that the graph in terms of number of weeks it takes to actually buy a PC. And I guess, my second question is also on the same topic here. Just in your emerging markets, what kind of product mix are you looking for the strength there? And I know that you guys are also pushing pretty hard for Ultrabooks. Just curious how that impacts your mix over time.
Paul Otellini
The strength -- the mix of the emerging markets is really historically is not much different than our overall mix. And every emerging market is different. For example, the Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities in China have a slightly richer mix than the United States on average. When you average China out across all the cities, you get a closer to average mix, maybe slightly down as you move into the Tier 5 and Tier 6 cities. But we really haven't seen the mix go down. The price should be dramatically different in these emerging markets because just like as you'd expect when it's your first time to buy a television, the first time to buy a computer, you want value. You want something that's going to last, that's going to be good for your company for more than a year or 2 and that tends to have you buy up a bit.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line Sumit Dhanda with Citadel.
Sumit Dhanda - Citadel Securities, LLC
A couple of questions. First, on the geographic trend, it seems like I hear on the mature markets that the Americas seem to do a lot better than Europe in the quarter, if you just looked at sequential sales growth. Any thoughts on the dichotomy there, especially given that North America had a tough comp as did Europe with the extra week in Q1?
Paul Otellini
Well, you have to be a little careful of that data because it's Billings data, Sumit, and now we're in a situation that worldwide supply chain builds and builds most of the notebooks in APAC. So I wouldn't draw too much of a conclusion from the Billings data. I do think we'd say that the consumer in North America was a smidge stronger than the consumer in Europe in the second quarter. And emerging markets across both regions was strong.
Paul Otellini
And Enterprise PC sales...
Paul Otellini
It's strong and good.
Paul Otellini
And the servers sales in North America...
Stacy Smith
Yes, and that's good point that Paul made. You tend to see more of the servers build directly in the market, so that also probably drives the North America numbers a little bit.
Sumit Dhanda - Citadel Securities, LLC
And then for my follow-up, Stacy, your comment that ASPs will be flat in 3Q despite that being typically the stronger consumer quarter, is that more an Enterprise driven phenomenon, i.e. PC Client business? Or is it just you think servers will be disproportionately strong in the third quarter?
Stacy Smith
No, it's more of an overall mix-within the different businesses, within the PC business and within the Server business. If I look back at what I've been predicting over the last several quarters, what I've been wrong on is that our mix to the core product line, Core i3, i5, i7, has been higher than I've anticipated. And so even with a bit of a seasonal uptick in the Consumer segment, I think that rich mix keeps me approximately flat from the same point of ASP.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung with Citi.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc
If we look at your third quarter guidance, can you give us a sense as to what parts of your business are above your average sequential growth and what are below? And I think in the major groups, PC clients, Data Center, other IA, and software services.
Stacy Smith
Yes. I'd say across the major businesses, what we're expecting is seasonal. And so what it is, is kind of a continuation of the trends we've seen so far. We've seen relative strength in enterprise and we've seen relative strength in emerging markets. We think that continues into the back half of this year. We've seen relative softness in the consumer segment. But looking back at a decade of data in every year, be it a strong year or weak year, we see the second half stronger than the first half on a unit basis just because that's the buying season both for enterprise and consumer. And so off of that weak first half, we think there's a seasonal uptick in the second half. So nothing significantly different from a normal trend. So I am just starting from a weak starting point and some starting from a strong starting point.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc
And then the other question I have is, when you look into the emerging markets client business, is there a difference there in the way inventories are managed, either from the perspective of overall PC inventories or from the perspective of stand-alone microprocessors? Is it harder to track, easier to track, do you feel like there they have control over that or they don't?
Paul Otellini
Actually, it's probably slightly better than we have in North America or Western Europe. And we have the same visibility into our multinational accounts, whether they ship in China or in Cleveland. That is we were off on these big hub. It's a system that basically they only draw what they need for their near term build. And in fact, we're seeing a conservatism there in terms of people moving a bit more to the air lanes versus shipping lanes just to be conservative. So in general, we feel pretty good about that part of the inventory. In emerging markets in general, a larger fraction of sales comes through the channel. A lot of that is white box and build-to-order. And by definition, build-to-order, if someone walks in and gives someone $200 and there's a computer that afternoon. So we get a much more real time feed there, and of course, we don't claim that revenue until it sells out through our distributors. So if anything, it may be slightly more realtime than the mature markets or the enterprise markets.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG
Paul, you talked about the percent of the client business just sitting at core today. I think you said 2/3. I'm kind of curious, where are we now as Sandy Bridge as the percent of core. And I guess as you go from a Core i3, non-Sandy Bridge to Sandy Bridge, is that kind of both an ASP and a gross margin accretive event for you guys?
Paul Otellini
We're taking Sandy Bridge in the second half of the year down below the core brand and taking version to that into Pentium and Celeron. And as a percent of our core business today, it's over half. And what was the second part of the question, John? I'm sorry.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG
As you go from sort of like a core non-Sandy Bridge to a core Sandy Bridge, is that both an ASP and gross margin accretive event for you guys?
Paul Otellini
If we sell the same SKU at the same price, it's just slightly better, because you're selling one chip instead of the chip to CPU plus chipset. But what we're seeing with Sandy Bridge is the trend to sell up a bit for every SKU because of the demand for the performance and the graphics capability.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG
And then Paul, as my follow-up, can you talk a little bit on DCG. Some of the challenge checks we've done around customer's expectations around Romley are pretty high. And I'm kind of curious timeline on Romley, and as you think about introducing that new server architecture, do you think that's going to cause some stall out in the DCG group? Or how should we think about that for the back half of the year?
Paul Otellini
There's really no change for the schedule for Romley, which for those of you who don't follow our code names, is the Sandy Bridge version of the server products. We're public in saying that we'll be in production this year, nothing's changed. We still expect to be in volume production this year. We have not gone public on the launch date because our server customers are very conservative about putting the dates out for exactly the reason you point out. I don't expect to stall out given the timing that we've built into the product. I would add that as you've seen the product, it looks very exciting . The performance is really quite good.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Berenbaum with MKM Partners.
Daniel Berenbaum - MKM Partners LLC
Just wanted to revisit ASPs real quick. With ASPs up year-over-year, how much of that is being driven by the client platforms and the brand name you've driving there? How much is being driven by pure mix in client and how much is being driven by a shift in the enterprise platforms?
Stacy Smith
Well, I don't think I can separate out the branding from the mix within client. I think those things are synonymous. I think that we've spent a lot of energy to be able to articulate differentiated features and performance at different price points. That's a tool that we hadn't historically used, and that in conjunction with having a great product like Sandy Bridge and the kind of performance that brings has led to the richer mix within the client segment. I think that in general, that's the bigger driver, and then the fact that the Enterprise market has been relatively stronger than the consumer market is a secondary driver to ASP good news that we've seen.
Daniel Berenbaum - MKM Partners LLC
And then you talked a lot about emerging markets, and I just want to make sure, emerging markets versus enterprise. How much of emerging markets is enterprise? Or do you have more or less visibility into what the split is between, say, consumer and small, medium business in emerging markets?
Paul Otellini
We'll get to that level of detail in this call. In general, the business segment in emerging markets is a larger percentage of the total. But as the affordability of technology comes down like we showed at the investor meeting. We actually expect a lot of the growth to come in the Consumer segment of those markets. It's going to be a faster part of the growth equation.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman with Gleacher & Company.
Doug Freedman - Gleacher & Company, Inc.
Stacy, if I could dig in a little bit on the CapEx plan and if the little bit of pull in that you're showing. Should I characterize these slight increase in CapEx this year as a pull in from next year given the slide that you put up at the Analyst Day? Can you help offer some color there?
Stacy Smith
Some of it is a pull in. Some of it is we're growing faster. So this is really construction-related spending. Some of it is we're going a little faster on the 40-nanometer factories. The larger portion of it, and keep in mind, we're talking about a relatively small increment. But the larger portion of it is an increase in the scope of those factories. As we guide into the planning, we saw some opportunities to do some things in the infrastructure that we're putting in place that make it easier for those factories to support multiple generations behind 40-nanometer. So kind of putting in place the capability for 10 and 7-nanometer, and when it gets kind of high ROI to do that now versus having to retrofit those factories later. So it's a combination of those 2 things, but if I was ordering, the capability is driving a little bit more and the speed is driving a little bit less.
Doug Freedman - Gleacher & Company, Inc.
If I could look at what's going on near term with the OpEx number, this one of the few times I think I've seen you guys grow spending faster than you're forecasting revenue growth from that perspective. How should we think about revenue growth and the fall through to EPS if we were to just be modeling your revenue. What should we -- is there a ratio we should think about that you're targeting to drop through or anything you can offer as color as far as understanding those 2 numbers?
Stacy Smith
Yes, I mean, the simple answer there is what I said at the Investor Meeting, which is Paul and I are still committed to drive spending as a percent of revenue at or below 30% is our long term goal. And so I do think we will, over the long term, get some leverage in that line item. But we have a couple of things going on now. We see very fast growth in revenues. So some of this is revenue dependent. When I just step back and look, we grew from 2009 to 2010, we grew the business $8.5 billion. From 2010 to 2011, we're on track to grow the business in excess of $10 billion again. And so that revenue and profit dependent spending is a piece of this. But I think more importantly, we're making some important investments in our business that we believe give us even better position as we go forward. And we talked at the investor meeting about redefining the PC category with Ultrabooks. We're making investments there. We're making investments in our Server business to continue and accelerate the growth rate in that business. And we're making investments in our Tablet and Phone business in order to improve the offering that we can offer to customers there. And Paul can talk a bit about that. And so it's a combination of those things, but right now, those investments are important. They don't change our long term view of the business, but they're important investments for us to make.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Craig Berger with FBR.
Craig Berger - FBR Capital Markets & Co.
Can you just, on the CapEx, help us understand how much of that is sort of 4-year equipment versus how much of that is longer-term halls and walls? And how long are your halls and walls depreciated over?
Stacy Smith
Of the increment, it's almost all construction, and that's -- you can have varying depreciation schedules but think of that as depreciating over a long period of time. We tend to use buildings for a decade. That's part of the reason that we build in the capabilities to support multiple generations in a factory. Equipment tends to depreciate on a much shorter period of time. Again, it can vary, but think of that over a handful of years.
Craig Berger - FBR Capital Markets & Co.
Can you talk about CapEx spending like that for the year not the increment, but the total?
Stacy Smith
Probably not at the level of detail that you'd want. But if you look at the CapEx that we're doing this year, we said at the investor meeting more of that, much more of that is being driven by building factories than what is normal for us. Andy talked about that in his investor meeting presentation. I'd refer you back to that. It's been a long time since we've had to build incremental shelves, but the growth in our business now requires it. So we're putting in place some clean room space that we haven't had to do over the last couple of generations. So it's a larger percent, but I'm not going to break out the exact percent between the 2.
Craig Berger - FBR Capital Markets & Co.
And then just a follow-up, gross margin Q2 to Q3, I know you've gone through it a little bit. But can you just help us understand again why there's greater than 100% revenue fall-through?
Stacy Smith
Yes, when I walk you through kind of the gross margin -- the short answer to your question is we're getting -- we're starting to get benefit of the tapering off of other cost of sales. And so that tends to give us higher than normal fall through. But if I step back and we use a reconciliation of Q2 to Q3 and talk a little bit about what I expect for the year, as we go from the second to third quarter, gross margin is going to be up around about 3.5 points. So that takes us up to 64%. The 3.5 points comes from -- we expect it to be a higher volume quarter. We've talked about that. We start to see -- as consistent with our historical patterns, we start to see the falling off of startup costs, so that adds about 1 point. We get about 1 point because we're now projecting to be finished with the impact of the Cougar Point reserves, so we don't have to repeat that in the third quarter, and then there's about 0.5 point as we continue up the ramp of the various 32 nanometer factories, our costs start to improve. We've talked about that on prior calls. So that's what gives us the benefit into the third quarter. And then as I think about the fourth quarter, and you can kind of get the math when you look at our annual forecast. I expect that we'll get little bit of benefit in terms of startup costs. You tend to see that come down over a couple of quarters. And so they think about the fourth quarter gross margin. I put it in the range of a bit higher than the 64%, probably based on what I know today, below the 65% that we've articulated as the high end of our range. So kind of in that zone.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Michael McConnell with Pacific Crest Securities.
Michael McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc.
Stacy, I had a question just looking at the segmented revenues here on fleet PC Client. Looks like you had growth in this business of about 11% year-over-year, yet operating profits were down about 1% year-over-year. Could you talk about the disconnect there with ASPs being as firm as they are?
Stacy Smith
It's startup cost, Michael. So if you think about our trend, you're on a two-year cadence. So during this year-over-year comparison from Q2 '11 to Q2 '10, what you're doing is you're comparing our lowest point in startup costs to our highest point in startup cost, because they start coming down here and if you think about that on a company-wide basis, some of that is DCG as well, but if you think about that on a company-wide basis, that's kind of 3.5 points of gross margin on a year-over-year comparison. So it's pretty significant.
Michael McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc.
And then I wanted to ask, looks like the upside driver relative to your expectations was in the other group or the Intel architecture group. And I think Infineon was about 90 million upside versus your expectation. So I understand that point and the driver there. What was the other areas, I guess, that were considerably strong and what's the outlook for that particular segment as we move into the back half of the year?
Stacy Smith
I apologize, I'm not sure I understand your question. If I look at what was different from the expectations when we started the quarter, Infineon actually came in kind of right where we expected it. At a good quarter, but in line with the expectations. The other elements in there were pretty much in line. The difference from expectations was our ASP was a little bit higher, our mix was a little bit better. And so -- and that was more of a PC and server comment than other Intel architecture group comment.

Our next question comes from the line of Shawn Webster with Macquarie.
Shawn Webster - Macquarie Research
A simple one, and then a more complicated one on CapEx. So on the simple question, what did your units do sequentially for processors? Where they down 3%, down 1%, flat?
Stacy Smith
Yes, on a sequential basis, it's a little bit complex, Shawn, because remember we had the 14th week in Q1. If I strip out the 14th week, I'd articulate it as units were seasonal. And you normally see a Q2 that's just little bit down from the first quarter.
Shawn Webster - Macquarie Research
And then on capital expenditures, high-level question is, if your outlook for PCs is coming down, I'm wondering why we didn't see CapEx be flat or maybe down some? And then maybe you could share with us your expectation for capital intensity. Do you expect it to get back to a historical, kind of 35% rate next year?
Stacy Smith
Remember the capital forecast that we put in place is in support of multiple generations. We don't buy capital in Q2 to support what we're doing in 2011. The capital we're buying is 22-nanometer peak. It's 14-nanometer factories. You'll soon see us moving into the cycle of 40-nanometer equipment. So it's a longer-term view. In terms of capital intensity, it's the same data that we shared with you at the investor meeting.

Our next question comes from the line of Uche Orji with UBS.
Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank
Let me just ask you about Ultrabooks. Sean was quoted at the Computex as saying that this should be about 40% of the consumer mix by the end of next year. If one were to go back and compare this to CULV from a couple of years ago, what makes you more confident that this will achieve this level of success? Do you enjoy the form factor? I think CULV also had performance issues. So if you can talk about the level of confidence you have with Ultrabooks, and how you see that ramping from now until next year to get to that 40%?
Paul Otellini
Well, as I look at this, I don't think that the Ultrabook strategy is anywhere near equal to the CULV strategy as you call it. That was really a kind of a point product. It was focused on form factor. We didn't really put a lot of engineering into it with our customers, and we didn't look at other features. If you will, it's kind of a trial run in hindsight is the way I would look at it. The Ultrabook project is much more akin to Centrino. It's a very holistic approach to moving the entire market to a different kind of form factor, not just in terms of its thinness, but in terms of the feature set. I talked about always on, always connected. So the machine is always aware of the networks around it. I talk about instant on, instant boot capability. We talked about building in integral touch into it, another feature set. So this is as much about the features around the skin, or inside the skin, as the shape of the skin. And as we look at this with our customers, we also see that there's a great deal of engineering that has to be done. Because one thing we know is that today, these feature sets cost more money. But we don't think that PC prices are going to go up over time. So what we have to do is work with the ecosystem to cost engineer these features for high-volume price point displacement. And that's the only way you can achieve sort of a 40% number as Shawn predicted in that timeframe is by doing price point replacements. And then looking forward a year later, into the next generation, silicon, it gets cheaper to do it so we could penetrate more of the market.
Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank
Another way to look at ASP resilience we've seen in your CPU business on the client side, how much of that is beyond just mix? How much of that is also, I believe, you can take more build up material share? And specifically, I just want to know if the things like graphic attach rates have changed within the configurations here, seeing and therefore, you're capturing all that value. Or is it a case of Intel taking advantage of the fact that components like memory are a lot softer and therefore there isn't much pressure to take CPU pricing down by your customer?
Paul Otellini
Well, it's really demand driven, that's the way I look at it. End customers are demanding a higher mix of product, which gets into the branding and feature set questions that came up earlier. In terms of bill of materials, we had a very strong position to integrate graphics prior to Sandy Bridge. That just got stronger for Sandy Bridge. It satisfies more and more of the market and customers are using it, particularly in smaller form factor machines because of the power advantage. So there's no compromise on pixels, as you get a significant advantage on battery life. And as a result, we're seeing a very strong utilization, both in desktops and notebooks for Sandy Bridge graphics.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Danely with JPMorgan.
Christopher Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co
Paul, I was wondering if you can just kind of take a step back and give us your latest thoughts on tablets, and ultimately what you think it will be and do to the PC market, what it means to Intel, and what sort of share goals do you have in tablets?
Paul Otellini
Chris, my thoughts really haven't changed from April. Even after I saw the numbers yesterday from Apple and we get engaged in lots of Win8 and Android tablet design activity across the board. I believe this category is additive to computing. I don't think it's going to replace any one category. I think it may replace some discretionary sales at any point in time. And I think that's one of the reasons that netbooks down year-on-year is this tablet's strength to some extent. The netbooks are probably also down because of the very good value if you can get in low-end notebooks nowadays as compared to, say, a netbook. So there's a number of pressures on that particular segment. Going forward, I really don't see that. I think it's a device that some people will use as a standalone device, but many people use it as a companion device, and that's good for us, and that seems to be the model even if you look at the Apple numbers, it seems to be the model that's consistent with their base.
Christopher Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co
And then as my follow-up, just some quick modeling questions. Going forward, what should we be thinking about share count and McAfee Flash and Infineon revenue?
Stacy Smith
So from a share count standpoint, I think you know that something we're not going to comment on. I can kind of tieback our philosophy to our actions in Q2 if you think that's helpful to you. We articulated the philosophy in the May Investor Meeting, first investing in our business, no change there. Dividends, second, and we articulated that we wanted to allocate more of our free cash flow to the dividend, making that approximately 40% of our free cash flow, and then using the remainder of cash generation, one of the things we look at there is the buyback. I think you can see that play out nicely in the second quarter. We kept our cash balances relatively flat. We increased the dividend 16%, we made significant investments in our business including the CapEx numbers. And we bought back $2 billion worth of stock with the free cash flow that we generated that was in excess of what we needed for those other uses. I think that's a nice model for us, and that's very consistent with our philosophy. In terms of McAfee and Infineon, what was your specific question there?
Christopher Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co
I guess, what you guys think or what should we be thinking on the revenue going forward if there's any sort of seasonality there?
Stacy Smith
It doesn't change the seasonality for the company as far as I can tell. So I haven't seen anything there. If you look back -- I commented on this earlier, if you look back across the last decade, we see in every environment that second half revenue is 2 points higher than the first half revenue. And McAfee and Infineon don't change that pattern for us.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line Vivek Arya with Bank of America.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch
Paul, I'm curious, how will Intel be impacted by the launch of Windows 8? Is that a net positive or do you think that changes competitive landscape? Like what are the puts and takes that we should think about?
Paul Otellini
Well, we talked about this an awful lot at our Investor Meeting. So I'm not going to give you a lot more color than we gave there, except to say, in general, I think it's good. I mean, whenever Microsoft has a new operating system, that's good for us. We've been working with Microsoft for several years now on the feature set of Win 8 and optimizing our silicon around it in PC space. I think the jury is out on how that will be received by the public in tablets, and we expect to be hypercompetitive for Win8 tablets. We're involved in the program as aggressively as any of the silicon vendors. And our job is to make sure that we can outperform, out battery, and out compatibility the ARM guys in Win8 tablets.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch
And just as a follow up on the near term, I think you mentioned 8% to 10% unit forecast. Slightly different than before. Could you talk about the fact that I think you mentioned the netbooks. But those have been weak for some time. Are there any other dynamics that plays at a macro issue, are there other factors we should think about?
Paul Otellini
The principal change is the netbook. As I said earlier, our core, mainstream PC and Notebook and Desktop business is still forecasted for us at double digits. And we're very comfortable with that part of the product line. The biggest change from 6 months ago is a slower growth rate on netbooks. So still showing growth in netbooks, just at a slower rate. And that has impacts on ASP. It also has impacts on our overall volume.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
The question I would have is, is there a way to quantify the impact of unit growth next year on the capacity side? How much will unit capacity be up in 2012 as a result of the CapEx in 2011?
Stacy Smith
I'm thinking about how to answer that question, Jim. As we've said, we're putting in capacity that's pretty consistent with the kind of TAM growth we've seen for the last several years. And we have some ability to flex up. So we're making sure we're putting in some factory space to go a little bit higher than that. And we have the ability that if things end up being softer than that as you saw us in 2009 to respond pretty quickly and bring down the CapEx number and just upgrade and bring in more capital at the leading edge node. So think of it as pretty consistent with historical unit growth rates with some ability to go higher than that and some flexibility to respond if things end up being a little softer than that. And I think Andy did a great job of articulating that in the investor meeting. If you want to refresh on that, we can take you through it.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
Yes, I remember he talked about how you can kind of shut it down pretty quickly. So to that end, if I can use my follow up on the same topic, if the PC unit forecast that you guys see keeps coming down, is there a number that we could think about that we could then expect you to kind of go more on the slower side on the CapEx as we head into next year? If it came down to 5, which is where the third parties are, maybe the third parties aren't right. But if your forecast kept coming down, is the market number, the third-party number a number where we would expect the CapEx to slow a little bit?
Stacy Smith
Well, it would certainly be much less than what it would be if the market growth is '12. But I realize that's not entirely helpful answer to you. But at this point in the year, that's as far as I'm going to go in terms of forecasting CapEx for next year. I mean, Andy also articulated, when we're building factories, and we're equipping those factories there tends to be a couple years cycle. So I gave you a strong hint to expect elevated CapEx next year relative to the historical trend line. If the unit growth is significantly less than we're anticipating, that number would be less than what we're anticipating. If it's more, it's more. But that doesn't help you because we haven't told you the baseline.
Paul Otellini
There's a third factor, Jim, I'd throw into here, which is that, increasingly our product line is more and more modular. And as we move from Sandy Bridge to Ivy Bridge next year, we have the ability to mix and match cores, and mix and match graphics engines, much more so than we've ever done before. So if we end up in a quarter [ph] case that you're describing where the markets short-term is much smaller than our ability to supply it, we can up crank our products pretty substantially at very little marginal cost. And really have a much more across-the-board competitive offering than even we have today.
Stacy Smith
There's lots of tools. It's interesting. There's lots of tools here at our disposal that we haven't historically had. The forward use of our capacity gives us the ability to move capacity quickly to the leading edge. 5 years ago, it isn't a capability we had. As Paul said, the modularity of our architecture now gives us a lot of flexibility just kind of mix-and-match the capacity to the growth of the market.
Operator
Our final question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo.
David Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
Stacy, can you go through the gross margin puts and takes as we go from the September to the December quarter, please?
Stacy Smith
Sure. I won't do it at a level of detail any more than I said in terms of I expect to be kind of a bit higher than where we are and under the upper range of 65% that we put out there. When I think about the fourth quarter, I think we would benefit from startup costs coming down. A strong fourth quarter gives us a couple of other benefits. And then I think the big variable for us there is we have a lot of product qualifications that are kind of teed up across the end of this year and the beginning of next year. And where are those product qualifications fall could dictate where the gross margin ends up. So in terms of variability, I think that's probably the biggest variable for Q4.
David Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
For my follow-up, Software and Services, it looks to me like the operating margin is still negative despite the full quarter of McAfee. Is that a normalized level of profitability, or are there special accounting effect that are still there that will go away over the next few quarters? And if so, can you give us some idea of the underlying operating margin you've got in this division at the moment?
Stacy Smith
Well, the revenue related accounting impact is in that segment. So you see that in the Software and Services Group segment. The amortization of acquisition-related intangibles is outside of that segment. So it's a little bit of a mix. That's sitting in the corporate line. I think what you're really seeing there -- so part of this will improve as we get the deferred revenue back from the accounting impact, that should be sometime next year. And you can see us already building up that deferred revenue balance on our balance sheet. So it increases just kind of watch that line item, it's not something you'd typically had to do with Intel. And then the other pieces, remember, there's still a lot of investment inside that Software and Services Group that's in support of tablets and in support of phones and things like that. So there's a lot of investment in there that causes the overall segment results to be, as you say. McAfee, if you just isolated that, looks quite good.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Q1 2011 Intel Corporation's Earnings Conference Call. My name is Chastity, and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Kevin Sellers, VP of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
R. Sellers
Thank you, Chastity, and welcome, everyone, to Intel's First Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. By now, you should have received a copy of our earning release and the CFO commentary that goes along with that. If you've not received both documents, they're currently available on our Investor website, intc.com.
I'm joined today by Paul Otellini, our President and CEO; and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll follow our normal practice by hearing brief prepared remarks from both Paul and Stacy, after which we'll be happy to take questions. By way of announcement, Intel will be hosting our Annual Investor Day at our headquarters here in Santa Clara on Tuesday, May 17, 2011, and we look forward to seeing many of you there. 
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. 
Also if during this call we use any non-GAAP financial measures or references, we will be posting the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliations to our website, intc.com. 
So with that, let me now hand it over to Paul.
Paul Otellini
Thanks, Kevin. I am very pleased to report another record revenue quarter for the company. As anticipated, consumer demand in the U.S. and Western Europe was soft, but consumer sales and emerging markets, and demand for both enterprise servers and clients were better than expected. 
The combination of a feature-led product segmentation strategy and a simplified branding structure has been very effective in improving the purchasing process for buyers, and leading us to achieve our best product mix in many years. Additionally, the rapid recovery from Cougar Point chipset issues earlier in the quarter enabled a much faster ramp of Sandy Bridge products than we anticipated in January. 
With regards to the tragic events in Japan, I want to first comment that all of our employees and their families are safe, for which we are very grateful. We did sustain some damage to our sales and marketing offices in Japan, but nothing major that would hinder our ability to service our customers. Our team on the ground is actively participating in relief efforts and we are deploying our technology to help connect families that have been dislocated by the earthquake and tsunami. 
As for our business, I want to note that we did not see any unusual changes or fluctuations to our backlog after the earthquake, nor do we anticipate any major disruptions to our supply lines moving forward. 
Aggregate inventory levels of the PC supply chain remained healthy and well within normal operating ranges as we enter Q2. In Q1, our customers replenished approximately half of the inventory that was depleted in Q4 primarily with new Sandy Bridge-based products. Compared to the first quarter of last year, which was a very good quarter for us, we achieved double-digit growth across every major product segment, and across every region in the world. 
Revenue for the Data Center business was up 32% from a year ago, with operating profit improving nearly 50%. Our other businesses also showed solid growth. The Embedded business was up 33%, NAND flash was up 17%. And I'm pleased to note that 1 of our new business areas, the Digital Home Group, grew 129% from last year and is now shipping at a rate of over 10,000 units per day into set-top boxes and smart TVs. 
Our PC Client business remains strong and grew 17% from last year. What we are witnessing is an explosion of computing devices that connect to the Internet, and Intel is a big part of this trend. We not only participate through selling our products into these device categories, but we also profit from the wide array of products that we sell in the build out of the data center capacity required to serve all of these devices. 
Turning to the Data Center Group specifically, the first quarter was another very strong quarter. DCG recorded Q1 revenue of $2.5 billion, putting us on a trajectory to reach $10 billion in revenue for this year across our server, storage and networking products. The cloud build out continues to be a major driver of growth for the company, with demand from China showing notable strength this quarter. 
Within the Data Center Group, the Storage business increased 45% sequentially and was up 65% from a year ago. During the quarter, we launched Sandy Bridge Xeon platforms for the single socket market, and early demand for this product has been very strong. 
Looking ahead, we are very bullish about our Data Center business and expect it to be a major growth driver for years to come. This past quarter, we also launched Sandy Bridge for client PCs. As I stated before, I believe that this is the very best product Intel has ever delivered to our customers.
Early demand for Sandy Bridge has been outstanding. In fact, the ramp of Sandy Bridge in the channel is the fastest ramp we've ever seen, and sell through has been robust. The reviews of Sandy Bridge have been outstanding and we expect the ramp to continue on a very sharp growth trajectory. 
We also launched Oak Trail just last week, which is a platform designed specifically for tablets. We are seeing very good design momentum with Oak Trail across multiple operating systems. Over the course of this year, Intel will have tablet platforms that run Windows, Android and MeeGo. 
We remain committed to success in the Smartphone segment, and we're actively working with a large number of handset manufacturers and carriers around the world on met field-based designs. 
Overall, we begin 2011 with great momentum. We've added McAfee and the Wireless Division of Infineon to our portfolio, and have ambitious plans for both acquisitions going forward. We are investing and developing new products for phones and tablets, and are turning our advantages in Moore's Law and computer technology into breakthrough products for these segments. All of our major product segments are growing, and these new segments are expected to add to that growth momentum. 
We remain on track to begin production on our 22-nanometer silicon process technology by the end of this year. This revolutionary technology will further distance Intel from the competition across all segments of computing. 
Let me make 2 final comments about demand and CapEx. Like many of you, I noted that some of the third-party research firms issued reduced forecasts for PCs in 2011. I want to be clear that our views differ from some of theirs. The PC business has evolved into a global industry that is approaching 400 million units this year. 
While some channels like PCs sold through consumer retail outlets and mature markets have deep visibility, other channels, especially in emerging markets, are not well reflected in the forecast of third-party firms until shipments from Intel and its competitors have been reconciled. 
Over the last 5 years, we have put considerable effort into improving our visibility with systems like just-in-time inventory hubs for our major customers, as well as realtime metrics to monitor sales through all of our worldwide channels. As a result, we were able to call the inflection in our business in Q1 of '09, as well as predicting 2010 growth to within 1 point of accuracy. 
Our projections for PC segment growth in 2011 remain in the low double-digit range based on early sell-through strength we are seeing as we begin 2011 and the great reception to Sandy Bridge in both Consumer and Enterprise segments. And while it's too early to call 2012 with an improving global economy, we see no reason for growth to be materially different from what we see in 2011. 
Secondly, we are increasing our forecast for CapEx spending this year. This reflects the widening of our process technology lead and the incremental opportunity that advantage will provide our business. The increased CapEx is focused on both 22- and 14-nanometer capabilities. 
As we tailor our product plans to meet the needs of emerging notebook, tablet and phone usages, we see a need for more platform features to be integrated into the microprocessor, taking advantage of our leading edge silicon capability for power management, performance and smaller, lighter devices. 
These are high ROI investments and will be the foundation for significant growth opportunities ahead. With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.
Stacy Smith
Thanks, Paul. The first quarter of 2011 had several significant milestones. It was a record quarter in terms of revenue and earnings per share. We closed both the McAfee and Infineon Wireless Division acquisitions. Our customers launched our Sandy Bridge platforms, our fastest ramping product in the company's history. 
In addition, the company identified, fixed and recovered from the Cougar Point chipset design issue, completely mitigating the $300 million revenue impact that was originally forecasted. The factory network executed flawlessly, lowering throughput times and significantly increasing first quarter output of Cougar Point replacement parts, fully recovering to customer demand by the end of the quarter. 
As a result of the acquisitions of McAfee and the Infineon Wireless Division, we will be providing non-GAAP financial information in addition to GAAP for 2011 to provide additional visibility into the operational results of the company. 
Excluding the impacts of deferred revenue write-down and associated costs, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and other acquisition-related accounting impacts, we achieved first quarter revenue of $12.9 billion, gross margin of 62% and earnings per share of $0.59. The rest of my comments will use GAAP financials unless otherwise called out. 
The first quarter ended up significantly better than our expectations. From a market standpoint, strength in emerging markets and enterprise offset the weakness that we expected and saw in the mature market Consumer segment. We continue to benefit from the strength of our product lineup across servers and clients. The introduction of Sandy Bridge extended our leadership and resulted in an increase in average selling prices. 
The third quarter of last year was the first time where our revenue exceeded $11 billion. Revenue for the first quarter of 2011 was $12.8 billion, up $1.4 billion from the fourth quarter, and up 25% year-on-year. The acquisitions of McAfee and the Infineon Wireless Division contributed approximately $500 million of the $2.5 billion increase from a year ago. 
Gross margin of $7.9 billion in the first quarter was a record, and the gross margin percentage was 61%. While gross margin benefited from higher average selling prices when compared to the fourth quarter, 22-nanometer start-up costs, higher unit costs, and the impact of the acquisitions brought gross margin down 3 points from the fourth quarter. 
The Cougar Point impact to gross margin was approximately 3 points, consistent with the impact to the fourth quarter. R&D and MG&A, as a percent of revenue, dropped to 28.7%. Our plan for 2011 is to sustain the progress we've made in our productivity and our efficiency, while making some critical R&D investments in the core business and adjacencies such as tablets and phones, and software capability and in process technology. 
Operating profit of $4.2 billion in the first quarter was up 21% year-on-year. Net income of $3.2 billion and earnings per share of $0.56 were up 29% and 30%, respectively, when compared to a year ago. Our philosophy of both investing in our business and returning cash to our shareholders was evident in the first quarter as we completed the acquisitions of McAfee and the Infineon Wireless Division, increased our capital spending, completed a $4 billion buyback and increased our dividend per share by 15%. The cash generation of our business remains strong with cash flow from operations of $4 billion in the first quarter. 
As we look forward to the second quarter of 2011, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $12.8 billion, flat to the first quarter and in line with historical seasonality. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range to be flat to the first quarter at 61%. The first quarter was a great start to 2011 and puts us on track to exceed our financial goals for the year. Seasonal growth from the first quarter puts us on the path towards another year of double-digit unit growth, and revenue growth in excess of 20% after the 24% growth we saw last year. 
We are making some critical investments in our business, both in terms of research and development and in taking advantage of our process technology leadership. The cash generation of our business remains strong and the first quarter results put us on track to another year of double-digit earnings growth. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Kevin.
R. Sellers
Okay. Thanks both Stacy and Paul. We'll now move to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] So Chastity, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Glen Yeung with Citi.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc
First question is maybe just helping us understand the emerging markets for Intel, how big it is? And maybe, Paul, some of the characteristics of that market that are different and are sustaining the growth that we're not seeing elsewhere.
Stacy Smith
Yes, actually, let me take a shot, and just give you a -- I think we've talked about this before, Glen. This is Stacy. The emerging markets now are well over 50% of our total business level. And I think the dynamic that's going on there is really one of economics. The desirability of technology is high and the affordability of technology is now coming into the range where when we look across markets like China, Latin America, Eastern Europe, you've got a couple of billion consumers that now the price point of a PC is within 1 to 2 months of income and it's really driving our growth, and penetration rates are still pretty low. So we think this is something that has legs and will drive our growth into the future.
Paul Otellini
And in terms of characteristics, Glen, I just point out that my comment on the channel strength for Sandy Bridge is principally emerging markets. Most -- something like 1/3 of all the PCs sold in emerging markets are not branded machines, their white boxes built by the channel through our distribution network worldwide. We saw strength on Sandy Bridge and even strengthened the Desktop business, which we haven't seen for some time based upon that product in those markets. And of course, those markets are still surging in terms of purchasing notebooks. It's not a low-end mix, I'd also add. It's a pretty average mix of products on a worldwide basis.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc
As a follow-up, I wanted to ask something about 22-nanometer. Paul, you used the word revolutionary and I've heard people at Intel use that before with respect to 22. So I'm wondering if you can shed some light on what that exactly that means. And then as part of the response, with $10.2 billion in CapEx, which is ostensively almost all geared towards 22-nanometer, is it really Intel putting their money where their revolutionary mouth is? Or is it really the money because you're trying to manage the absolute amount of capacity that you have?
Stacy Smith
This is Stacy. I'll start with the second part of that, and then turn it back over to Paul. The CapEx number for us is really driven by a couple of things. It's driven by the unit growth and the mix that we're seeing and it protects our ability to meet demand at 22 and 14 nanometer. You didn't say 14 nanometer, but that's an important part of this story. And it enables our strategy to integrate more features and functionality on to that leading-edge process technology, which as Paul said in his prepared remarks it gives us performance, cost and power efficiency advantages. Let me give you an example. Probably the biggest single chunk that's happening inside of this increase in CapEx is the fact that we've made the decision that for the development fab for 14 nanometer, we're going to make that fab bigger. That gives us the ability to actually, at the early stage of the ramp, move more products to 14 nanometer, take advantage of that process technology leadership, ramp it faster. So we're going to spend some construction dollars today to have that capability in place of 14 nanometer. But over the 14-nanometer life, it should save us money by going faster on that first factory. So those are the kinds of things that we're doing to both protect the ability to respond to demand, and also make sure that we have the transistors available on the leading edge to give us the competitive advantage in the marketplace.
Paul Otellini
On the revolutionary comment, you're right. You picked that up, Glen. I actually thought I was at the first 1 at Intel to use that, so. I thought I’d embargo [indiscernible] a few times already. Well, it's not inaccurate, but I'm afraid it's only meant to be a teaser today. We'll be disclosing that technology in early May before the Analyst Meeting. We're having a separate press event around that. And I think when you hear that announcement, you'll understand why this phrase is appropriate.

Our next question comes from the line of Tim Luke with Barclays Capital.
Timothy Luke - Barclays Capital
I was wondering, Stacy, if you might have been able to just give us some sense of how you're thinking about the shape of the year for the acquisitions in terms of I think you said you outlined that you expect McAfee and IFX to double sequentially, but how would we think about seasonality there? And I was wondering on a broader level, how we should think about any of the seasonal trends for the second half of the year given all the different puts and takes on data center and emerging market growth?
Stacy Smith
Sure. I'll be happy to do that. And by the way I understand this is your last call, so I think as a thank you for your years of following us, we'll let you ask a multipart question. We'll give you extra time to do that.
Paul Otellini
We were a little disappointed. We thought you'll give us a 7-parter, Tim.
Stacy Smith
You can think of another part to this, if you want. In terms of McAfee and Infineon, we closed Infineon at the end of January. We closed McAfee at the end of February. The combination of those 2 acquisitions added $0.5 billion of revenue to Q1. And based on having a full quarter in Q2, they should add another $0.5 billion in Q2. In terms -- so now let me help you a little bit with Q2 map, because you've got a couple of offsets. You got this incremental $0.5 billion for McAfee and Infineon. It's offset by the fact that we don't have the 14th week, those are roughly in line with each other. And so when you net those out, what you see is Q2's kind of flat on an ongoing business basis to Q1, which is in line with seasonal patterns we've seen over the last 5 years. Going into the second half of the year, I'm not going to get as discrete as providing a forecast for each quarter, but we're not seeing anything that would cause it to be a different year. We see through all kinds of economic climates. The second half of the year tends to be 2 to 3 points higher than the first half in terms of revenue. That's consistent with our expectations as we work through the year.
Timothy Luke - Barclays Capital
Maybe just as a follow-up then, given the focus of investors on the tablet and smartphone side, you've obviously mean making some changes in your team associated with smartphones, there's a lot of product ramp in tablets. What do we see as the key milestones, for example, with respect to Computex, et cetera for these 2 areas?
Paul Otellini
Well, you'll see quite a bit of tablet demonstration to Computex. If you notice what we did at IDF in Beijing last week, that was -- there were a lot of tablet-centric announcements there around MeeGo and Windows and Android. And so we're heads down on a number of designs on tablets on all 3 of those operating systems where we see the Android code, Honeycomb version of Android source code from Google, and we're actively doing the port on that and expect to be able to ramp those machines over the course of this year for a number of customers. In terms of phones, obviously, we lost Nokia, which took a lot of wind out of the sales for phones this year. We've redirected those resources onto a number of other major accounts, focusing on carriers who want their own devices and also on handset manufacturers. They're all based on Medfield, which is, I think, still the first 32-nanometer phone apps processor in the industry. And quite frankly, the limit in terms of them getting to market is going to be the interoperability testing of the networks at this point in time. So I think I would be very disappointed if you didn't see Intel-based phones for sale 12 months from now.

Paul, question on the emerging markets and each time I put out the over-under shipment, I hear back from your on-the-ball IR team about how that number is not being counted by the IDCs and the Gartner's of the world. But what -- for the total PC market, what is the percent that these third-party companies are missing?
Paul Otellini
What is the percent they're missing?
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.
Off the total PC market. Because the PC data from first quarter...
Paul Otellini
They're all over the map. Right now, Gartner's at 11% for the year and IDC, I think, is at 6% or 7%. And I gave you our number, which is the low-double digits. So there are some that we agree with and some that don't. And I think as normally happens when we release our results and when our competition releases theirs and they integrate all the data, they revise the forecasts.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.
Okay. That's fair. And then I had a follow-up, please. The follow-up would be on the met field, Paul, what are some of the key metrics that are working -- that are getting the engagements with the key customers? Is it a combination of met field being on MeeGo as they open-source? Or as where people can differentiate? Or is it just the fact that you have been able to bring down Medfield performance down to the competitive arm architecture?
Paul Otellini
It's both. It's both. Early customer activity is on Android and on MeeGo. And we've got ports on both those operating systems. The product is very good in terms of performance, particularly in the area for media, so high depth video replay, that kind of thing on phones. And the power is right smack dab in the envelope you want it to be.

Our next question comes from the line of Uche Orji with UBS.
Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank
Paul, let me just begin a little bit on the Data Center Group. You called out storage of $0.45 sequentially. Can you talk about what's going on within the other subsegments of DCG, like IP -- for the IP Data Centers, Enterprise, Network and Service? So if you can, just tell us what's going on there. And we've seen this group grow significantly, faster than one would think servers are growing in terms of units. Can you talk about the trends of multiprocessor servers as kind of what may be driving these ASPs, just so that we can get a comfort as to what the longer-term growth would be?
Paul Otellini
Sure, sure, Uche. First of all, we recognized this group has had pretty phenomenal growth across all of its various product groups. So what we've decided to do for the Analyst Meeting is do a deep dive for all of you guys and we'll do a full, if you will, keynote session on that, breaking out all the detail on how we see the server market, the market for Xeon-class devices today and tomorrow. But if you look at traditional servers, you're right. We're outgrowing the traditional enterprise server market by a factor of 2 or 3. And as we look forward, by 2014 for example, we think half of the market for Xeon is high-performance computing and cloud. That's a dramatic change from 80% of the market being enterprise servers just a couple of years ago. So when you look at the rate of growth of HPC, of clouds, of the nominal growth in servers, and then the conversion of other parts of the data center, that is networking equipment and storage, from proprietary designs principally now to fundamentally Intel-based designs, you see an aggregate growth rate that is really representative of, I think, all the growth in the Internet. And all these devices connect to these servers or these network machines 1 way or another. And this is where we're benefiting quite well. So you see -- on 1 side you watch the growth of tablets and smartphones. This is where the rubber hits the road for those devices is in data centers around the world.
Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank
Thanks for that. Great, thanks for that. Let me just ask you on the Moore's Law transition you're making now from 22 to 14. I don't know if I should read that as being slightly more aggressive than what we think is a typical ratio as you go from 32 to 22 or from 45 to 32. Is there anything that -- I know Glen asked this earlier when you talked about things being revolutionary at 22. But what is driving the speed now in terms of moving to 14? And in terms of what you're able to do at 14 vis-a-vis say 22 or 32, can you give us any idea as to what comes in here? I mean you talked about having mixed signals capabilities and all that. Is there anything else you can tell us, A as to what's driving this speed, and then also what we should expect?
Stacy Smith
This is Stacy. So I'm going to punt on the capability part of that question for another few weeks. You'll see that when we do our disclosures around 22 nanometer and really start to talk about some of the secret sauce that's going to come out in that technology, so that will carry it forward into 14. In terms of the speed, we're still on a 2-year cadence. So that hasn't changed. That is our Moore's Law cadence, and we're driving that faster than anybody else in the industry. So even at that 2-year cadence, we're extending our leadership over others. What we're realizing, though, is that competitive advantage is becoming more and more important to us. And we're getting -- we've always gotten paid for it in terms of cost. We're now also getting paid for it in terms of differentiating our product line and getting paid in pricing. And so at an economical, where you can see it in our results over the last 6 or 7 quarters, as we have extended our leadership, our products have extended over the rest of the industry, we've segmented our product line and we're getting paid in a new way for that process technology leadership. As we get out to 22 nanometer, as we get out to 14 nanometer, what you're going to see is we're going to bring capabilities to the process technology more quickly than we have historically. And so we'll intercept 22 nanometer with our smartphone roadmap, with our netbook roadmap earlier in the technology, we'll ramp our core business more quickly so we get into these kind of square wave transitions. And then get paid for that performance and cost by having the leadership over the rest of the industry.

Our next question comes from Chris Danely with JPMorgan.
Christopher Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co
First, can you just talk about where utilization rates are now and where you expect them to go in the second half of the year? And how much capacity you're adding? And could we run into some actual shortages coming up here?
Stacy Smith
Could we run into some shortages? We're running I'd call it in the healthy range of utilization. So as we said before, not too hot, not too cold. Certainly on the chipset side of the business as we had responded to the Cougar Point issue, we ramped very quickly there. But I'd say in general, we're not anticipating shortages. And I think we have the ability to respond. If demand ends up being hotter, we can put the capacity in place. And frankly, if we end up in a situation where demand ends up being less, I think you saw in 2009, we now have the tools to respond very quickly to that kind of environment. So I think we can respond to both sides of that equation as we get into the second half and into 2012.
Christopher Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co
Great. And as my follow-up, you guys did a good job of explaining the differences between sort of your PC forecast and the third party. It seems as though perhaps some of you're OEM customers have a little bit more of a tempered forecast on PCs versus you. Maybe you could take a shot at explaining that? Is that maybe on the storage side? Or what would be the differences there in your opinion?
Stacy Smith
PC on the storage side, I'm not sure I understood the question, Chris.
Paul Otellini
I don't think we want to get into characterizing various specific customers, Chris. Some of them have their own issues. But let me just say that I think that those who are more enterprise-centric than those who are focused on consumer markets, particularly in Western Europe and the U.S., are seeing numbers that are closer to ours than closer to what yours were.
Christopher Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co

Our next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo.
David Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
Could you give us an idea of what percent of microprocessor sales Sandy Bridge made up of in the March quarter, and what this percent might be in the June quarter?
Paul Otellini
I don't think we want to get into that level of granularity, David. I can tell you that unit shipments on Sandy Bridge will more than double from Q1 to Q2. And it is our fastest ramp ever for new processor family. And you'll see it move from the high-end throughout, sprinkling down through all of our products families over the course of the year. It's a very, very rapid ramp.
Stacy Smith
And just to give you 1 other tidbit to give you a flavor, more than 50% of my CPU inventory now is Sandy Bridge. So you can -- that kind of gives you a sense of how fast we're replacing the older generation products with Sandy Bridge. And gives you a good indication of what things will look like over the next couple of quarters.
David Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
And for my follow-up. Stacy, in your online comments, CFO comments, you have for your gross margin puts and takes, a hit of 1 percentage point from higher platform unit costs and another 0.5% from lower ASPs for the second quarter. Does Sandy Bridge have a higher platform cost and a lower ASP? Or is there something else happening here on top of the ramp of Sandy Bridge?
Stacy Smith
No, it's something else. So as you do the walk from Q1 to Q2, I'll just take you through the full walk. So obviously, we got 3 points of benefit because we don't repeat the Cougar Point impact that's in Q1. We see about 1.5, then it offsets that because it will be the peak quarter in terms of our startup cost. If you think about the trends we've shown you over the years, Q2 is where -- Q2 of an odd-number of years is where those startup costs will peak and then they come down. There's about a point as you pointed out in unit costs. There's really 2 things driving that. 1 is that we're seeing a little bit of an increase in some of our component costs, so think of substrates made in Japan where our supply lines got a little bit tight. So we're seeing a little bit of a pricing impact on those kinds of things. And then we're also again as a result of what happened with Cougar Point, we pulled in the ramp of our China factory pretty significantly. And so what you see is more chipsets coming out of a new factory that's ramping, and that's driving my weighted average cost up a little bit in Q2. And in the ASP pieces, and I realize I have a little bit of a credibility issue on forecasting ASP right now given it was up again in Q1, but we had a very rich mix in Q1. As Paul pointed out, the way Sandy Bridge ramped was at the higher parts of the pricing stack first. Over the course of Q2, we'll see Sandy Bridge flavors across a much more representative series of price points. And I'd expect the Q2 mix to come down a bit and be more in line with what we would normally expect. It's not huge, it's 0.5 point of gross margin. But it does come down a little bit.

Our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri with CLSA Securities.
Srini Pajjuri - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.
Paul, on the corporate side, obviously, demand has been very strong. Just wondering what's driving that. Is it just the Windows 7 upgrade cycle? And if so, where do you think we are in that upgrade cycle?
Paul Otellini
I assume you mean corporate PCs, Srini. We're seeing -- obviously on the corporate side, we're seeing good growth in the data center. Yes, on the -- we saw, I think I said that sort of mid-last year, we started seeing the enterprise market start to recover from the recession timeframe. And the most recent data we have is that something like 75% of enterprise PCs are still running Win XP. And so if you think about a 3 to 4 year refresh cycle, we're probably not even halfway through that cycle yet. And I think that the adoption of Win7 seems to be pretty strong and the combination of the Win7 SKUs with Sandy Bridge as we look forward into Q2 and Q3 look really good from our customers' perspective.
Srini Pajjuri - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.
And maybe for Stacy, on the start buybacks, looks like you were pretty aggressive in Q1. And given the strong cash flow, and also you ruled out larger acquisitions pretty much. Is this something we should expect going forward in these kind of buyback rates?
Stacy Smith
Well, we've articulated the priorities in terms of how we -- our cash priorities as first investing in our business. Second, the dividends. Third, using the buyback to return cash to shareholders and bring down the cash levels. I think you see that we've been very aggressive in terms of all of those in Q1. You do have to keep in mind we have brought down the cash balances quite a bit. But you could temper that by pointing to the fact that in the first quarter, we announced that the board authorized an incremental $10 billion of buyback and we're kind of just at the beginning of that authorization.

Our next question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
I'm sorry to come back to this, but if I think about this third-party data situation that we're talking about, even if I assume a 5% ASP increase for the quarter, you guys would have out-shipped PC clients by 20% relative to the third-party data. So the idea that the third-party data is kind of off by 20% and if that's the case, we haven't seen that kind of discrepancy up until now between your data and the third-party data. So what's making that data more wrong this quarter than previous quarters?
Stacy Smith
I think what that analysis misses, Jim, is how much inventory levels came down in the fourth quarter. If you remember in the fourth quarter, we were significantly worse than seasonal, and what we saw in the fourth quarter was a significant bleeding off of inventory, some of which we believe was in anticipation of us bringing out Sandy Bridge. And so component inventories came down, you saw a little bit of a refill of those component inventories in the first quarter. So the amount that it came down, probably half of that went back in, which would be us being above seasonal. When we go out and do our looks across the channel, we see inventory levels being healthy. And I think it really points to the robustness of the supply chain. The people who make motherboards for notebooks brought their builds down. We saw some older generation inventory bleed up. It looks like they're starting to ramp up now they get into the back-to-school season.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
I guess if I could just ask my follow-up on that then, that's a little bit different than the idea that just the third party data's wrong. Is it that the third-party data is just really off and that's why the third-party data is so different from your shipments? Or is it that the supply chain drew down a whole bunch of stuff and it kind of rebuilt it during the quarter, which is pretty reasonable?
Paul Otellini
Well, let me back up, Jim. The comments that I made relative to third-party data and ours were on an annual basis, looking at year-over-year, trying to set the granularity for the year. And I didn't comment on the specific comments that were written up recently on Q1, it was x% down from Q4, x% down year-on-year. Because that looks at consumption, and what Stacy was talking about is our billings. And there is a bit of a difference there, at least in the ramp up for Sandy Bridge. So really, it's apples and oranges. And I think what our experience is that on an annual basis, the numbers are closer. Our numbers are closer than theirs together. It's closer together. And that they correct over the course of the year to be aligned. You saw that happen last year as we were predicting 17%, 18% all year long, the numbers were all much lower than that. Then they came back in line as we got to the fourth quarter.
Stacy Smith
Jim, I left out 1 piece as you think about Q1. So what Paul said is exactly right. When I talk about Q1 and we're talking about the supply line impact, you also can't lose sight of the fact that for us, Q1 was a 14-week quarter. That's a piece of our shipment numbers relative to what you may be seeing from other data sources.

Question on the foundry strategy. There's a lot of flux going on in the foundry world and I think TIs and some other OEMs are going away from the Korean, the giant. What part of the incremental CapEx is part of a strategy that you may have there that you've been not talking up and will you talk about that over the next several quarters?

It's not a driver of our CapEx. We are interested in talking to some very specialized companies in terms of doing foundry things. We are not building a broad-based Foundry business and it's not driving our CapEx number.
Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.

Our next question comes from the line of Avik Bhattacharyya with Bank of America.
Avik Bhattacharyya
Paul, a question on the Server and the Data Center business, obviously, very strong this quarter. Can you give us a sense of the mix between MP and DP servers? How is the transition progress towards Westmere-X, and just in general, what's your assessment of the competition?
Paul Otellini
After we'd launched the new MP server chips, the mix came up a little bit. We're seeing a pretty robust growth in BP as well. A lot of the Internet data center growth is BP machines in some of those configurations. On the other hand, some of our largest IDC customers are using the biggest, beefiest parts we have. So it really is different. I haven't seen this ship dramatically in the last couple of years. There's just a nice consistent mix of DP versus MP. But the capability of all the devices really is stunning. The amount of compute power that we're delivering per core now is really what is delivering a lot of the value in a very power-efficient envelope. So the ROI on upgrading from old to new servers is really what is compelling both for enterprise and data center -- enterprise and Internet Data Center.
R. Sellers
Avik, this is Kevin. I would add because we made this public, too. What we have seen across UP, DP and MP has been a mix shift within those categories, so sort of Paul's point. That has been 1 of the drivers of the revenue growth is because the ROI is so good, we're finding the Data Center group -- or sorry the Data Center providers, what they're doing is they're buying up in that stack for the ROI. So that's been a big driver. To the higher bin split.
Stacy Smith
A good example of that was this quarter we brought out UP versions of Sandy Bridge and that caused a pop up in that segment of our business.
Avik Bhattacharyya
And as a follow-up, I think it's obvious that -- 1 investor question has been when will we start to see Intel make more tangible progress on the mobile side? And the question there is that first, when will we start to see that progress? What kind of metric should we track? And conceptually, what do you think will be x 86, the architectures differentiation versus the established on ecosystem, a lot of very strong players like QUALCOMM, DI, NVIDIA and others?
Paul Otellini
Well, I'm not going to give you more granularity on Mobile than I gave already in the earlier answer, Avik, so sorry to disappoint you there. Watch those things as they come out. Our customers will announce the design wins when they are through their interoperability testing or entering it when it becomes visible. And I don't want to add more to that. In terms of x86 versus ARM, it is not just about the core as much as we would like it to be, and I guess as much as the ARM guys would like it to be. It's about the core, the overall capability of the system on Chip, the things you put around it, the graphics, the com subsystems, the media processing subsystems and the overall power envelope relative to the performance that you can deliver of the SoC. So the Intel advantage that we see going forward is the combination of very robust computer architecture that can scale, the ability to bring on very high performance graphics and media processing, and now a wide array of comps architectures that we can bring in, and taking advantage of the world's best silicon. When you add those together, I think it gives us a very strong value proposition in this market. I'd also point out that all of the major operating systems in phones and smartphones are written at a high-level such as they're cross-platform and portable. And so it is easier for people to move from ARM to Intel or ARM to ARM than it has been in the past in the Windows.

Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG
Paul, going back to your opening comments about weakness in consumer client for U.S. and Europe, what do you attribute that to? Do you think this is tablet cannibalization, poor macroeconomic, Win7 difficult compares? And I guess more importantly, do you think Sandy Bridge has enough brand recognition to drive a recovery in that market? Or how do we think about that for the balance of the year?
Paul Otellini
I think it's a little bit of everything, plus you mentioned Win7 saturation for consumers, the tablet things and macroeconomics. I think it's a little bit of each of those, John. But I'll add 1 more, which I think is a big one. Remember in 2009 in the first half of '10, during the depths of the recession, the consumer notebook market worldwide, particularly in the U.S. and Western Europe, was very strong and it was strong contrary to GDP at the time. Remember GDP was going south and consumer sales were going north. And I think what happened is that people bought a lot of machines in that timeframe and we're still just early in the cycle. So those machines are 1.5 years old or less. And so seeing a consumer refresh right now probably isn't, on average, what you're going to see in mature markets. Because this is not like emerging markets where people are buying their first machine. This is a mature environment where people are buying a new machine when they decide that they need to upgrade or whatever. Now clearly some tablet cannibalization is impacting that, but I think the bigger 1 is that macroeconomics and the prior cycle.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG
And, Paul, as my follow-up. Talking about the enterprise client market, that's been a relatively strong market.

Our next question comes from Shawn Webster with Macquarie.
Shawn Webster - Macquarie Research
In terms of the Client business, I was wondering if you could give us a flavor of what your units did sequentially parsing out between desktop and notebook growth sequentially. And what your outlook is for Q2?
Stacy Smith
Certainly not at the level of granularity you're asking the question, but I can give you a sense. From the standpoint of client shipments, you'd say slightly above seasonal, once you net out the 14th week. And again, it comes back to my answer to Jim Covello's question, which is what we saw was an inventory burn in Q4, and a partial refilling in Q1. And that led to units being slightly above seasonal. Going into Q2, you kind of net out the impact of a full quarter of acquisitions with the lack of the 14th week, and you'd say Q2 looks pretty seasonal.
Shawn Webster - Macquarie Research
And then given the CapEx growth that you're seeing, I was wondering if you can give us a sense of what you expect your total wafer production globally to grow in calendar '11, calendar '12. Is it consistent with your PC outlook, or is it something that's different from that?
Stacy Smith
Wafers, over time, in generation will grow a little bit faster than the TAM because of the phenomena where I said we're moving more capabilities to end. And so -- and then I think your follow-up question to that should be, ""So okay, what happens if we get that wrong?"" If we're wrong on the demand, how do we respond to the market? And I point back to what -- the capability we have to very quickly roll forward capacity from 1 generation to the next. And I think you saw that from us in 2009 when the bottom fell out of the market, we were able to bring our CapEx number way down, offset over half of the 32-nanometer investment by repurposing equipment we'd already purchased for 45 nanometer. So if we overestimate, we can respond within a couple of quarters and get gross margins back up into the healthy range pretty quickly. The flipside is if we underestimate, it takes us 2 years to recover. And that's a devastating financial impact on us. So we look at this as being a pretty -- it's a high ROI investment for us, and we have the tools to modulate it, if it comes to that.

Okay, that's helpful. And then the follow-up. In the past, you've sometimes quantified the number of tablet design wins that the company has. Can you be specific in that regard? And related to that, is there a particular OS flavor, whether it's MeeGo, Android, or Windows, where you think you'll be particularly successful, at least with your initial wave of launches?
Paul Otellini
I don't have an update, simply because I didn't hear the final number from IDF, and we'll do another number count at Computex. Actually, we'll do another number count on May 17 for the Analyst Meeting -- it's 35 or so. It's in that range, it hasn't changed. My sense is the bulk of the unit, the SKUs this year will be Android.
Craig Ellis - Caris & Company
Great. Good luck with it. Thanks, guys.

And our final question comes from the line of Sumit Dhanda with Citadel Securities.
Sumit Dhanda - Citadel Securities, LLC
First question, Stacy. Your comment on the unit cost in Q2 going up because of substrates and the pull-in in the ramp of the China factory. Is that transient relative to the chart you put up at your Analyst Day? Where you expecting a bump down initially in Q2, and then a bigger bump down in Q3? How does that chart change?
Stacy Smith
Q2 is clearly elevated from what I put up in the Analyst Day, and then you'll see a pretty rapid decline back towards trend over Q3 and Q4. And you can kind of see that, I mean if you look at just gross margin trend, we're 61 61. This is on a GAAP basis. The annual number is 63. And so that would suggest that the second half is back up towards the mid-60s, 65%. And you got a couple of tailwinds there, 1 is the abatement of startup cost. We start on the trend where they start falling off stream in Q3, and our costs get a little bit better as we go into the second half of this year consistent with what I showed at the Investor Meeting.
Sumit Dhanda - Citadel Securities, LLC
And then my follow-up question was in startup costs. So it was a 1.5 impact in Q1, and then a similar impact in Q2. I guess my question is, is the impact a little similar in Q2 because it was lower in Q1? Because again, I think the profile was up in Q1 and Q2 per your initial expectations, but I thought that the increase into Q2 was going to be more modest relative to Q1, if my facts in the Analyst Day chart are correct.
Stacy Smith
Yes, I'm trying to triangulate it in my head. It hasn't changed for the year. When I started the year, I was expecting to be about 3 points. It's still about 3 points on the year. So yes, I think what you're seeing is it was a little less in Q1, a little more in Q2. And then it starts coming down. You can see it's down 1.5 by the time we get to Q2. A little higher in Q1, and yes, so what you said was correct.
Sumit Dhanda - Citadel Securities, LLC
Okay, thanks, Stacy.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q4 2010 Intel Corporation earnings conference call. My name is Marcello, and I'll be your coordinator for today. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.
I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Kevin Sellers, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Kevin Sellers
Thank you, Marcello, and welcome everyone to Intel's fourth quarter 2010 earnings conference call. By now you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with that. If you've not received both documents, they are currently available on our Investor website intc.com.
I am joined today by Paul Otellini, our President and CEO; and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. We will follow our normal practice by hearing brief prepared remarks from both Paul and Stacy after which we'll be happy to take questions.
By way of announcement, Intel will be hosting our annual investor day at our headquarters here in Santa Clara, California, on Tuesday, May 17, 2011. We look forward to seeing many of you here.
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.
Also if during this call we use any non-GAAP financial measures or references, we will post the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliations to our website intc.com.
So with that, let me now hand it over to Paul.
Paul Otellini
Thanks, Kevin. Our fourth quarter results represent the third consecutive record quarter for the Company and bring to a strong close the best year in Intel's history.
Revenue was up 24% for the year, and we crossed over the $40 billion mark for the first time ever. We exceeded previous records for gross margin, operating income, and earnings per share as well. The PC market grew approximately 17% worldwide in 2010. Not only is the market expanding, but our customers and end users are embracing our performance leadership and purchasing a richer mix of our products, which led to a rise in our ASP in 2010.
One of the notable standout performers in the fourth quarter was our Data Center Group. The world of PC, plus new emerging computing devices is increasing the demand for servers of all types. Our Data Center Group had yet another terrific quarter, with revenue up 15% sequentially and annual revenue up, a very strong 35%. So, what is driving this growth in servers and will it continue?
Let me share with you some data that can help put the server market in perspective. In 2010, total traffic crossing the internet was roughly 245 exabytes. This is greater than all the previous years combined. Over the next five years a billion more people will join the global online community, with 15 billion new connected devices including PCs, smartphones, tablets, embedded devices and smart TVs.
We estimate this will increase the data footprint across the Internet to over 1,000 exabytes, more people, more devices, more usages. This dynamic will require high-performing servers from Intel for years to come. It is not just servers.
Intel continues to grow its presence in the Data Center with processors for storage systems and networking infrastructure, with plans to refresh the entire Xeon server product line in the first half of 2011. Intel is very well positioned to benefit from the growth of the Data Center and the build out of cloud computing.
Next, I want to comment on our Atom business. The industry shipped around 37 million netbook units for the year, which represents a 20% growth rate. In 2011, Intel plans to bring some unique innovations to netbooks to keep the category growing, including increased feature sets in products for mature markets, and lower price points in emerging markets that will attract first-time buyers. But Atom is much more than netbooks.
We exit 2010, with excellent momentum in our embedded business, with over 4,900 total design engagements and over 1,700 design wins for Embedded Atom devices. It's notable that nearly one half of all the Atom embedded design win activity is coming from China. I mentioned this momentum to highlight that the main drivers of our success with Atom in the embedded business segment are very applicable to the smartphone, tablet and consumer electronic market segments.
Software comparability, performance, power and architectural consistency really matter to our customers, and the success we're having with Atom in the embedded segments is an excellent proof point of our value proposition. Many of the wins in this space are architectural conversions against ARM and MIPS. In 2011, you will also see Atom in a wider ray of tablets running three different operating systems, Windows, Android, and MeeGo.
Seven of these tablets have been announced by their manufacturers with many more in the pipeline for rollout this year. In 2011, you will also see Atom processors appear in smartphones, operating at very competitive power levels with performance that will lead the industry, demonstrating Intel’s advantages in this most important category.
Let me turn my focus for a minute to what’s ahead. In 2011 everything gets better. The economy is forecasted to improve, our product line refreshes from top to bottom and our addressable market expands. With the PC industry now shipping over 1 million units a day, we entered 2011 by launching the best microprocessor we have every built.
As you are all aware, we introduced our Sandy Bridge processor family at CES last week. We think this ultimately will be as transformational to PCs as Nehalem been to servers. With over 500 design wins, our customers are embracing this product. When you get your hands on a Sandy Bridge PC, you will realize that this is more than just a very fast microprocessor. It’s a visually stunning computing experience.
The combination of an improving economy and the best product line-up in our history, gives us confidence that we can grow our revenues by approximately 20% in 2011, and this forecast is before any contributions from the proposed acquisitions of the Infineon's Wireless Solutions division and McAfee.
As we approach our 22-nanometer transition, we are increasing our investments in manufacturing to capture what we believe is a significant opportunity for growth. Stacy will walk you through more details in just in a moment, but in short the market opportunities for our 22-nanometer products are outstanding. As a result, we are growing from the model of three high volume leading-edge manufacturing fabs to four
Our 22-nanometer process will be the foundation for growing PC and server segments, as well as a broad family of Atom-based SoCs, serving smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, and other embedded devices.
Many of you have asked us questions about how we will compete with ARM in the new segments of mobile computing. Our answer is very simple. As we have done for decades in the traditional computing markets, we will apply the world's most advanced silicon transistor technology to these new segments to deliver the lowest power, highest performance, lowest cost products on the planet.
When these chips are combined with our support for the world's leading mobile operating systems, our proven ability to create broad ecosystem support and our growing software capabilities, I'm confident we will be very successful in these segments. These investments are the strongest possible statement of our confidence in our business model and our growth opportunities, and will extend our technology advantage even further.
With that, let me turn it over to Stacy.
Stacy Smith
Thanks, Paul. I just want to clarify one thing real quick. We're all getting used to saying 2011 over 2010. Paul meant 10% revenue growth in 2011 over 2010 is the expectation that we're setting. So, 2010 was the most profitable year in our history, as the trends we discussed at the May Investor Meeting played out.
The emerging markets, notebooks, and server demand, all exceeded 20% growth year-on-year. The consumer market, despite a mid-summer pause, driven by the European debt crisis, still grew at a mid-teens growth rate. All of these demand drivers led to an $8.5 billion increase in revenue to $43.6 billion, up 24% year-on-year and our best year ever.
Our manufacturing process technology lead extended in 2010, enabling a next generation of leadership products, which drove higher average selling prices year-on-year. Our continued focus on factory reuse and efficiency drove cost down again in 2010 lifting gross margin to a record 66%. A noteworthy achievement is that as a result of the combination of our responsiveness of the downturn and our focus on factory productivity, we're able to offset almost half of the required capital investment at 32-nanometer through reuse of equipment.
Spending as a percent of revenue dropped year-on-year to 29.5%. We also saw significant improvements in our NAND business. All of these things contributed to making 2010 our most profitable year ever. While revenue, gross margin, operating profit, net income and earnings per share were all records, two metrics worth highlighting are that we achieved operating income of $15.9 billion, 32% higher than the next highest year and our best ever revenue per employee of 529,000.
The fourth quarter was in line with our expectations and was a good finish to an outstanding year. We achieved record quarterly revenue of $11.5 billion despite continued softness in the consumer market segment.
Demand was strong in the enterprise market, specifically for servers. The quarterly gross margin at 67.5% benefited from both lower inventory write-offs as we qualified the Sandy Bridge product line for sale, and slightly higher average selling prices due a richer mix of server products.
Operating income was $4.3 billion, 38% of revenue. Net income of $3.4 billion and earnings per share of $0.59 were both records. The strength of our business can be seen in the balance sheet. Total cash investments ended the year at $21.5 billion, $1.2 billion higher than the third quarter and $7.6 billion higher than the end of 2009.
For the year, we generated approximately $16.7 billion in cash from operations. We purchased $5.2 billion in capital assets, paid $3.5 billion in dividends, and repurchased $1.5 billion in stock. We returned over $5 billion of cash to shareholders in 2010.
For the year, we increased the dividend by 12.5% and resumed stock repurchases in the fourth quarter. We also announced an incremental 15% increase in the dividend that will go into effect in 2011.
Turning to 2011, we are planning on continued growth in our core businesses resulting in approximately 10% revenue growth. We are forecasting continued strong gross margins with the mid-point of our annual range at 65%.
In support of expected strong unit growth in our core businesses and the movement of graphics transistors to our leading edge process technology, we're forecasting an increase in capital spending to $9 billion as we build and equip an incremental high volume manufacturing factory at 22-nanometer.
We are also forecasting an increase of over $700 million in research and development investments as we look to extend our leadership in PCs and servers and design further generations of products to increase our offerings in adjacent market segments like smartphones and tablets.
2010 reinforced our view that the demand drivers that we talked about in May, emerging markets, notebooks, consumers and servers translate into significant revenue growth for Intel and that the work that we have done on our cost structure translates into exceptional financial results.
As we move into 2011, we are planning for an even better year. As we start the year, the product line in our Core business is outstanding as Sandy Bridge ramps into the marketplace. Our cost will come down even more in 2011. Our manufacturing advantage will continue to extend, which coupled with our roadmap of low-power products will expand our participation in fast growing segments of the market for devices that compute and connect to the internet.
With that, let me turn it back over to Kevin.
Kevin Sellers
Okay. Thanks, Stacy and Paul. We’ll now move to Q&A. We’d like to ask each participant to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up, if you have one. So Marcello, we’ll now take our first questioner.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Alex Gauna with JMP Securities.
Alex Gauna – JMP Securities
I wanted to start by asking how you feel the OEM partnerships that you have are distinguishing between the roadmaps on the Sandy Bridge architecture from what you've got on Oak Trail and Atoms? I say that because I've noticed at CES you do have your first tablet win for Sandy Bridge on the Core i5 and I know you're moving ahead pretty aggressively on your process geometries.
Paul Otellini
At this point the only people I'm aware of using Sandy Bridge or Core processors in tablets are those focusing on Win 7 tablets. The design momentum that I've seen in Android and in MeeGo is focused more on kind of an iPad apps-centric model, applet-centric model. Those that are doing real Windows and one that have the Windows compatibility and the full Windows stack, there's a few of those like the one you mentioned and then also the Acer one with the two screens, which is sort of a tablet-laptop combo that are running Core-based products.
Alex Gauna – JMP Securities
A follow-up if I could. How are the Android developer partners you have differentiating between what they can do with the Atom or Oak Trail roadmap versus with the ARM-based systems?
Paul Otellini
Well, at the OS level there shouldn't be any difference. We should both run the same operating system, the same interfaces, the same access to the marketplace applications and so forth. Our value proposition is really twofold for the OEMs. One, we believe that we will offer higher performance in comparable battery life configurations, and number two, by designing an Atom-based tablet they have the opportunity to run multiple OS's on it, which is I think a unique value proposition with Intel at this point.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with Caris & Company.
Craig Ellis – Caris & Company
On the 10% growth for this year, can you provide us with some of the gives and takes you should think about parts of the portfolio that could do potentially better than that, and then what would be below the 10% line?
Stacy Smith
Yeah. I probably won't get to that level of specificity. I'll go back to what we said at the Investor Meeting in May. The drivers of our business right now are emerging markets. It's the consumer segment of the market. Then we're seeing a build out of that cloud infrastructure, which is driving our server results. I'll really highlight the emerging market piece of this because if I just look at the business it's 2 to 1 in terms of unit growth coming from emerging markets versus mature as we think out over the next several years. The dynamic that's going on there, it's a simple one of economics from my perspective. The price of technology has come down to the point that billions more people can afford that technology and that's highly desirable and if I may, I'll use China as the example. If you go back to the mid-90s, it was on average of 175 weeks of income for somebody to be able to afford a notebook computer. If you fast forward to 2010, it's now seven weeks of income in China on average for somebody to afford the computer, see a 1.4 billion people that where the price of computing is coming into a range that is affordable and it's a big deal to them, because it's how they move into the knowledge-based economy. So, that I think is the big driver of our business, and has been last few years. It's likely to be over the next several years.
Paul Otellini
If I could just tag onto that Stacy, Greg for planning purposes inside of our number set that we've, the 10% that we forecasted, we're assuming a low to mid-teens PC market growth rate in units.
Craig Ellis – Caris & Company
Paul this at low to mid-teens growth rate include tablets or exclude tablets?
Paul Otellini
Exclude.
Craig Ellis – Caris & Company
As a follow-up, as we think about the design wins that the Company has in tablets and we can certainly count numbers that are in the 10s to 20s, as we look at our own research. When do we hit the sweet spot of the ramp for Intel in 2011 for the tablet products that it'll be shipping into?
Paul Otellini
I think its operating system dependant. Unlike bringing up Sandy Bridge, we've got an installed base of PC software, right. It's just ready and able to take advantage of it. These things have to be tuned to their unique environments. So, from a launch perspective, the ones that have been and I'm not going to give you launch dates, but the ones that have been announced so far, are on Windows 7 and on Android and then in the second half of the year, you will see MeeGo. So, it really is a building momentum over the course of the year on all three operating systems.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Shawn Webster with Macquarie.
Shawn Webster – Macquarie
Paul, can you share with us your thoughts, I guess longer term on capital intensity. The capital expenditure new guidance you gave as $9 billion at roughly 55% of your expected cost of goods sold or so is pretty high. Do you expect this to be a peak over this cycle or longer terms, because of the graphics and some of the other things you mentioned, do you expect it to be at a higher level than what we're used to seeing?
Stacy Smith
Let me first talk about what's driving the increase in capital and then, I'll end with a few words on capital intensity, if you'll allow that, Shawn. The primary driver of what's taking us from a three factory model, three high volume manufacturing models to four high volume manufacturing model is the unit growth that we've experienced over the last couple of years and that we expect going forward. I think you can really see how our business is growing when you look out what's happened over the last couple of years. In 2010 and with our focus for 2011, we're growing our revenues by $13 billion, that's more than a one-third growth versus where we were in 2008, where we were in 2009. So, you can see that businesses growth is a primary driver of what's taking us into a four factory model. Behind that what you are seeing as that we're being very aggressive of moving transistors to that leading-edge process technology and we do that, because we get paid for that process technology leadership. We get paid in terms of having lower costs. What was really striking in 2010, as we started the transition of graphics processors to that leading edge, we got paid in terms of the rising ASP because of the performance of the products. So, there is very high ROI for us that we are uniquely situated to take advantage of because of our process technology leadership. Those two things in conjunction take us from three to a four factory network.
Shawn Webster – Macquarie
My follow-up then is, can you comment on Microsoft’s announcement last week in terms of them supporting their operating system on ARM. What’s your view on it and what are your responses?
Paul Otellini
I view it as being not a lot of new news and I can see positives and negatives for Intel in this announcement. Historically, Microsoft has only supported ARM in their phone OS and in their consumer electronics OS. So they have had ARM support for some time. In fact, in big Windows it had support for Alpha, PowerPC, MIPS and at one point ARM on the Vista program that they dropped. So this is nothing really new from that perspective. The plus for Intel is that, as they unify their operating systems, we now have the ability for the first time, one to have design from scratch, touch enabled operating system for tablets that runs on Intel that we don’t have today. Secondly, we have the ability to put our lowest power Intel processors running Windows 8 or next generation Windows into phones, because of the same OS stack and I look at that as an upside opportunity for us. On the downside there is a potential given that Office runs on this products for – there is some creep up coming into, let’s say PC space. I am skeptical of that for two reasons. One, that space has a different set of power performance requirements where Intel is exceptionally good. Secondly, users of those machines expect legacy support in terms of software and peripherals that has to all be enabled from scratch for those devices.
Stacy Smith
I just want to go back. You let me off the hook a little bit too early there in terms of the increase in capital, when you look at 32 versus 22. So, I also want to put that in perspective. It was in my written remarks, but I want to make sure it's clear. One of the benefits that we had at 32-nanometer was that as the downturn hit us, we were able to very quickly take capacity that we had put in place for 45 nanometers, factories that we had put in place for 45-nanometer and upgrade those to offset some of the required investment at 32. I think that was a level of responsiveness that you haven't seen out of Intel in the past. We take advantage of the fact that we build in that backwards compatibility in our capital model of record, and we were actually able to offset half of the capital required at 32 by utilizing investment that we had already made in factories for 45-nanometer. What that means is, at 32 we got in essence three factories for the capital cost of two, and then it's the unit demand and the movement of transistors to a leading-edge process technology that then takes us from three to four. That helps you put in perspective the size of that job as you go from the 32-nanometer node to the 22-nanometer node.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Morgan Stanley.
Mark Lipacis – Morgan Stanley
When do you expect to start shipping the 22-nanometer products into production systems? Paul, you may have mentioned this, I think I may have missed it, can you help us understand to what extent do you think about using the incremental 22-nanometer capacity for PC microprocessors versus tablets or cell phone microprocessors?
Paul Otellini
Well, we haven't given out the product schedules for 22-nanometer. So let me give you a status at least in much detail as I'm willing to get to make public. We have finished development of the process. We are in yield learning deployment right now, running test ships in there, ramping the yields up on the technology. We have completed the design of our first microprocessor and have working microprocessors on that technology. At this point in time our plan is to ramp production wafers of that technology in the second half of this year with products launched at some point to follow.
Stacy Smith
The second part of your question, Mark, was around the…
Paul Otellini
SoC.
Stacy Smith
22-nanometer?
Paul Otellini
Yeah. We're building some on 32 now and then the initial products on 22 will be the mainstream microprocessors, because we want to use every early wafer we can for those products, but we will move as rapidly to 22 as possible for the non-PC part of the product line.
Mark Lipacis – Morgan Stanley
If I could just follow-up, the CapEx, how should we think about that getting cut between the faster depreciation schedule for equipment versus slower depreciation schedule for buildings?
Stacy Smith
The lion's share is going to be equipment. That investment bucket, the lion's shares equipment, you'll see a little more factory spending than what you've seen in the past, but it's the equipment to fill the factory that ends up being expensive, and you can see that in the depreciation forecasted goes up from $4.2 billion in 2010 to $5 billion in 2011.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy with Stifel Nicolaus.
Kevin Cassidy – Stifel Nicolaus
Maybe just to ask a little more about the 22-nanometer conversion with the SoCs, are you comfortable, you have the design wins now to fill that fab?
Stacy Smith
The 2011 capital spending of $9 billion is the dollars are really being driven by the server and PC business. That's what's driving the increase in the unit CAGR. Those are big die. Remember the products that we have in smartphones, the products that we have in tablets by design are very small die. It doesn't drive a big capital spend for us. Don't take from that though that it's not important to get those products to 22-nanometer that process leadership is what lets us bring down the cost, bring down the power and provide more performance at any given level of power. So, it's strategically really important, but it's not the driver of the $9 billion of capital in 2011.
Kevin Cassidy – Stifel Nicolaus
If I could just follow up with, you're saying mid-teens in unit growth, it's assuming ASPs will come down, they were up last year, why do you think ASPs will down in 2011?
Stacy Smith
Just to say you don’t bid us up here, Paul said low to mid teens in unit growth for 2011 and 10% revenue growth, you still get to the same question, which is, that would suggest ASPs come down a little in 2011 to kind of make that revenue number work. I’ll be the first to admit this is the place where I have been wrong over the course of 2010. I did not anticipate ASPs going up to the extent that they had, the Company has surprised me positively the ability to extend the technology leadership over the competition and get paid for that leadership. That said, my thesis on the market is that the areas where we see robust growth. So remember what I said, emerging markets 2 to 1 over mature; the consumer market 2 to 1 over the business market. Those areas benefit from the standpoint that system price points come down over time, and we get a little bit of a mix down. So I believe that we're going to see, just based on that mix effect pricing coming down over time. I'll also say it's one of those places where I'd love to be wrong. The Company is working hard to try to prove me wrong, but inherent my forecast is that pricing comes down some based on growth in consumer and growth in emerging markets in 2011, and I think that trend is the one I'm betting on for the next several years.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Wang with Wedbush Securities.
Patrick Wang – Wedbush Securities
My first one, I just want to think a little bit about the enterprise refresh cycle. You guys had a pretty good year last year. Client was clearly a bit softer. Just curious how far you think we're into the current upgrade cycle for enterprise? Also where do you think you'd actually see strength in the client or consumer side over the course of 2011?
Paul Otellini
It's hard to put a number on it. My sense is given that the corporate refresh started not on the first day of last year is that we're not halfway yet. There is a whole bunch of people that have not upgraded to Windows 7 and that intend to. I do think that Sandy Bridge there may be some momentum built up ahead of that in terms of people wanting those products. Remember the IT version Service Pack 1 version of Win 7 wasn’t released until mid last year or August-September timeframe. So you really have the tailing edge of the IT shops, the ones that wait for SP1 still to go and so implicit in our numbers when I gave low-to-mid teens is a pretty robust corporate refresh cycle continuing in 2011. In terms of client parts of the business next year or this year rather, I think Stacy nailed it. We look for consumers and particularly in emerging markets continuing to be the driver of that part of the business in notebooks rather.
Stacy Smith
If I make one other point on the server market, which I was struck by when I was looking at our 2010 results and Paul touched about in his speech, I think there’s a secular trend here in terms of the build out of the cloud infrastructure and while that still is a relatively small percentage of the total of our server business, it’s growing exceptionally fast and I was surprised that it generated one-third of the unit growth in servers from 2009 to 2010. That’s a trend that I think carries forward into the future. The information moves to the cloud, all these devices compute and connect. I think that continues to driver server results for a number of years.
Patrick Wang – Wedbush Securities
I also want to talk a little bit about chipset. In the fourth quarter chipset for your client business was down 4% sequentially. Can you talk about what you saw there and given that there should be an impact from the ramp to Sandy Bridge and upgrading chipset to the 67, 66 series, how you feel about that tracking here in the first quarter?

I think it was as simple as what we said at the beginning. The quarter actually unfolded very much like we expected which is nice when that happens. We saw people bleeding off some of the older generation technology from an inventory standpoint, which impacted our sales that's why we're below seasonal, that's why chipsets were below seasonal. I think one of the things you have to think through as the world moves to notebook, the chipset is a leading indicator that thesis no longer exists. You don't have nearly a larger marketing where people are populating a motherboard with the chipset and everything else, and waiting for a CPU. It's all happening in Taiwan and its being integrated commensurate with each other, and so it's not the leading indicator that we believed in the 90s.

Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse
Paul, when you look at the Data Center Group and the sequential growth in the fourth quarter, I'm wondering you can help me understand how much of that was unit versus ASP and as you look at the balance of 2011, is there a lot that mix can do to help average selling price, as you look at that market unfold this year?
Paul Otellini
I'm not giving a lot of granularity there, John. I can tell you that over the course of the year, one of the reasons that we did increasingly well in Data Center was the shift to MP, as the MP products we're shipping and that includes those Internet Data Center deployment that Stacy was just talking about. Most of the big portals used four-way machines running, 6-cores now going to 8-cores this year, so there is about the most power compute-intensive consumers we have on the planet. So, going into 2010, I think that's still a driver, I think that the Nehalem value proposition is still very critical for, let me say, classic Data Centers, Enterprise Data Centers we still haven't finished anywhere near swapping out all the old systems. The same kind of ROI that we saw work in 2010 will apply in 2011 for those companies.
Stacy Smith
It was one of those great years, we saw a strong unit growth and strong ASP increases based on our technology in the Data Center Group and that drove the strong year-on-year results.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse
As my follow on, when you look at Sandy Bridge and its impact on the discrete graphics market. What's your view as this year unfolds and I guess, if Sandy Bridge starts to allow OEMs to take discrete graphics cards out of systems, and yet still, provide to capture some of the ASP benefit of the graphics capability from Sandy Bridge, how much ASP leverage do you think you can get out of that product cycle?
Paul Otellini
I think it's healthy, but the biggest leverage, I mean, given that I'm quite confident that Sandy Bridge is going to be a home run, in fact, at CES, I said that, in 2011, Sandy Bridge alone will represent over 30% of Intel's corporate revenues. So, we're very, very confident of the product and its acceptance. The biggest thing for us is sell-up inside the Sandy Bridge family, because as we – we will populate Sandy Bridge across multiple price points over the course of the year, but we'll maintain some of the premium feature sets, like the Intel Insider for high-value content that we announced at CES. We'll maintain those at the Core i5 and i7 brands. So, we'll do sell-up in those over the course of the year. That will be the focus versus, can the OEMs shave a bit off the building materials. They will certainly do that, but as everybody does that, that just brings the pricing to equilibrium.

Your next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman with Gleacher & Company.
Doug Freedman – Gleacher & Company
If I could start with just how are we to think about the impact of the extra week, and if we're to assume sort of a full 7% revenue impact, I get somewhere between $700 million and $900 million impact to Q1. Should we think about that, and then how do we think about that going forward to Q2, both on the revenue and OpEx lines?
Stacy Smith
So, the beauty, as we know what the extra week was, because what we're doing as we're resetting the calendar such that our year end is more towards New Year versus Christmas, and we know what the billings were between Christmas and New Year. As you can imagine, it's not an average week, it's a low week. So, when you take into account, the actual billings we saw that we – what you'd say about Q1 is because of the ramp in billing of Sandy Bridge, it's a bit about seasonal. More granular on that I'm not going to get, I'm not going to provide a forecast yet for Q2. We want to get through Q1 and then we'll have that conversation.
Doug Freedman – Gleacher & Company
How about on the OpEx side, would we think that you capture an extra week of OpEx that the OpEx goes away in Q2?
Stacy Smith
OpEx is much more predictable like that, because you do – people actually want to be paid, even though we're adding an extra week. So, we know that we have more OpEx in Q1 and we have a week less in Q2, and our spending pretty much will reflect that.
Doug Freedman – Gleacher & Company
If I could for my follow-up, move on to a different topic. Acquisitions, there has been some issues, trying to get some of them closed by the end of the year, I know was the target. Last quarter you were kind enough to offer us the commentary that no big further acquisitions were planned. I wanted to see if I could get you to repeat that statement and give us an update on where you stand?
Stacy Smith
So, first the status of acquisition in Infineon, we expect that it's closing in the next several weeks, all the regulatory approvals that have been received on that. On McAfee is going to be dependent on whether we get a request for more information from the European Union. If we don’t it could close in Q1, if we do it's likely to move in the Q2. I was really clear on the call last time that what I was going to say when I got this question was, we don’t comment on a forward -looking basis on acquisitions and that’s the answer you are going to get. So, we don’t comment on forward-looking acquisitions.

Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Sanford C. Bernstein.
Stacy Rasgon – Sanford Bernstein
Just a brief one on the 2011 gross margin guidance. I was wondering if you can give us a little bit of feeling on where you might see the most volatility in terms of those drivers. What are the things you think are pushing towards the higher end of that, versus the lower end of that? What will be the bigger drivers for that for 2011?
Stacy Smith
Let me just start by doing 2010 to 2011 reconciliation in currency, and currently how I am thinking of gross margin. In 2010 it was 66%. We are forecasting 65% for 2011. As is pretty predictable, because we are on a two-year cadence of process technology, 2011 is year where we are going to see elevated start-up cost. So that takes me down about 3 points of gross margin. As my unit costs come down and my CPUs and chipsets, and my platform business, that gets back about a point of gross margin. Then I am expecting higher revenue in my platform businesses and that’s worth another point of gross margin. That’s how I get to a point down. In terms of volatility, the start-up costs are pretty predictable. The thing that got me in 2010 was ASP and based on where we're seeing growth, in which segments, that could be off on ASP based on the competitive dynamics, that could be off on ASP. So that tends to be the thing that is most volatile. Then behind that is business levels. If business is robust and we're running factories, it's beneficial to gross margin. If we have an economic shock that causes demand to fall, we'll see a decline in gross margin. So those two things are likely I think to cause some volatility to gross margin as we go forward.
Stacy Rasgon – Sanford Bernstein
For my follow up, you've got Atom revenues that are it looks like pretty much flat for the quarter. So it doesn't look like netbook sales necessarily are falling off the cliff like people might be afraid of. But I was wondering if you could give us some feeling for how much of those Atom revenues might be netbook versus non-netbook related. Is the non-netbook portion material enough where you feel comfortable giving us at least just a ballpark estimate of how much it might be?
Stacy Smith
It's relatively small. The underlying growth rates of things like Atom that's moving into embedded applications is very high. We've talked about the progress that we've made in the back half of this year of winning the category of smart TV, and so if you look at first half versus second half, you see a high category in that unit growth rate, but it's still a relatively –
Paul Otellini
On netbooks specifically, I'll go back to what I’ve said in my comment, you may remember, a year ago, we had a problem in the fourth quarter of '09, where people bought ahead on chips from Intel, netbook chips from Intel and sales slowed down in the first quarter. So there was an anomaly. So what I've talked about in my commentary was the consumption of netbooks that we believe was 20% year-over-year, and actually it was probably up a bit in the fourth quarter as it is the seasonally strongest quarter for netbooks and even devices like tablets as some people buy them as Christmas presents. So looking into next year, what we forecast and project is yet another year of growth in netbooks.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Berenbaum with Auriga.
Daniel Berenbaum – Auriga
On operating profit, I mean just looking at the model or the guidance you've given for gross margin for R&D, it looks like operating margin would likely go down next year. When we think about – do you think about 2011 as more of an investment year or how should we think about what operating margin performance might look like over the course of the next couple of years? Or how we should think about a longer term model there?
Stacy Smith
First, I think your math is correct, right, gross comes down a point, we offset some of that – actually if we get a little better in terms of spending as a percent of revenue, but it doesn't offset that full point. That said, the operating margin is historically at high levels. I mean, we're running a gross margin that's in the mid-60s and our spending as a percent of revenue, as we've communicated our strategy of driving efficiency continues to improve. We are making significant investments in 2011 and they are investments that are really important to us. If you look onto the covers of the increase in spending from 2010 to 2011, it's predominantly R&D, that R&D is split between investments in our core business, investments in some of the important adjacencies like tablets and phones. We're investing more in process technology. We're investing more in software capabilities to bring all these devices together. So certainly Paul and I are looking at 2011 as a year, where we're making some big important investments that we think generate great returns for us in the future.
Daniel Berenbaum – Auriga
So are those multiyear investments or is it sort of a big rebuilding year or investment year or is it a multiyear investment?
Stacy Smith
I think you can look backwards and say we started making significant investments last year. Our investment profile increased a lot in '10. It's increasing more in '11. We'll make the decisions for '12 when we get there.
Daniel Berenbaum – Auriga
To follow-up on the capital side of the investments, you talked…?
Stacy Smith
Yeah, but I do want to just say one thing. You might have taken from what I just said that we're backing off from the commitment to continue to drive spending as a percent of revenue. We're not backing away from that commitment, so we're taking advantage of a robust market in '10, a robust market in '11 to make some important investments, but we as a Company continue to have efficiency and productivity as one of the things that's got to be embedded in everything we do because it's critical to win in some of these new segments. So I just want to make sure that was clear from my prior statement.
Daniel Berenbaum – Auriga
On the capital side of your investment, you talked about the rationale for adding a fab is really being unit driven for your core business, but is there any foundry CapEx in there? You've actually talked about starting to do little bit of foundry work for some small customers. Was any of this specifically targeted at expanding your foundry business?
Stacy Smith
No, don't take from that again that we're not focused on that business, but it is nowhere nearing being a driver of CapEx for us in 2011. We're at a scale of $9 billion. It's not a driver.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Brendan Furlong with Miller Tabak.
Brendan Furlong – Miller Tabak
A quick question on the seasonality aspect of the year, could we look similar to 2010 where we had a better than season Q1 and worse than seasonal given the 10-year historical second half of the year?
Paul Otellini
We're not going to get to that granularity at this point, Brendan. We've provided our forecast for the first quarter. We've given you the expectation for the year. Let us get through Q1 and we'll give you the forecast for Q2.
Brendan Furlong – Miller Tabak
I guess my follow-up question is kind of circling back on the chipset question that somebody else asked. The chipsets as a percent of the CPU revenue or the Data Center Group has declined over the last eight quarters. It used to run about 20% of the total revenue and now they're running into mid-teens. Can you explain what that is, and is it going to bottom around here on the mid-teens?
Stacy Smith
I think off the top, it's the shift from DP to MP. More of the mix goes to MP, so you have more processors for chipsets.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura Securities.
Romit Shah – Nomura Securities
If your assumption is for ASPs to be down this year, why is that not factored into your gross margin reconciliation?
Paul Otellini
It's an interesting phenomenon in that we had ASPs up in '10 and so it gets a little – it's kind of counterintuitive because we don't see that a lot. So, if you think about the world from the standpoint of year-on-year change, it looks like the average for 2009 is about what the average is for 2010 and it doesn't pop out in the – I'm sorry, the average for '11 is about what the average was in 2010, and so you don't see it in the year-on-year recon. What you have to keep in mind is, over the course of 2010 our pricing went up, and so I ended at a higher level than my average, and from that I come down some over the course of 2011. Again, that's a place where we're fighting hard to make that not be true, but that is my expectation inside of the gross margin forecast.
Romit Shah – Nomura Securities
Just on the server business, several quarters a very good growth including Q4 and Paul, you highlighted some of the strong secular tailwinds. How does this segment influence your Q1 outlook and is there any seasonality in servers now?
Paul Otellini
I haven't dug into that for a while. I don't think so. We're seeing just pretty consistent growth. It tends to go in cycle, the cycle start up with Nehalem – seven quarters ago, I don't see it abating. It is historically, if I go back before the Internet Data Center bubbles, strong growth, the fourth quarter was always the strongest quarter for servers because, capital budgets expired, people brought servers before the year changed. I haven't seen that as being the driving trend for several years now.
Stacy Smith
I also agree. I don't think there is strong seasonal pattern to severs, but I will say, in Q1 in the guidance, the thing that causes us to be a little better than seasonal, once you adjust for that fourteenth week is the ramp in sales of Sandy Bridge. That's the driver in Q1 and that's not yet in the server market. So, you should assume from that, that it's the ramp in Sandy Bridge which is notebooks.
Romit Shah – Nomura Securities
So the fact that servers have been strong for so many quarters that trend doesn't concern you that a slowdown is eminent?
Stacy Smith
We do not see a cycle here where people finish the refresh and then we have a dip. The underlying traffic growth over the Internet and the shift to cloud data and services is its own trend and that alone will drive nice continued growth in the business.
Paul Otellini

Welcome to the Q1 2010 Intel Corporation earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today’s call, Mr. Kevin Sellers, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir. 
R. Kevin Sellers

Thank you. It sounds like we had some background noise and I hope that was taken care of. Thank you, operator. Welcome everyone to Intel's first quarter 2010 earnings conference call. I am here with Paul Otellini, our President and CEO and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. 
A few important items before we begin. First, we posted our earnings release, CFO commentary and updated financial statements to our investor website, intc.com, for anyone who still needs access to that information. Also if during this call we use any non-GAAP financial measures or references we will post the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliations to our website as well. Following brief prepared remarks from both Paul and Stacy we will be happy to take questions. 
As we begin, let me remind everyone that that today’s discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. One final note, we have scheduled our annual Investor Day on May 11th at the Intel headquarters here in Santa Clara. We look forward to seeing many of you here. If any of you need additional information about that event please contact Intel Investor Relations directly. 
So with that, let me hand it over to Paul.

Paul Otellini 

Thanks, Kevin. A year ago at this time the industry was in the midst of a sharp correction with many expecting it to continue for an extended period. We saw signals of a bottoming then and now a year later the industry has nearly fully recovered. 
At Intel we focused on expanding our Nehalem architecture, getting our 32nm processor technology ready and in designing alternatives and derivatives of our new Atom processor for many new market segments. As a result of that focus we started this year with the best product line up we have ever had with leadership in all segments and categories. Demand for these new products has been incredible and as a result Intel achieved record first quarter revenue and in operating income. 
It was notable this quarter the demand for our higher end PC products was particularly strong which helped improve margins and profitability. Our mobile business set a new revenue record as demand for notebooks continues to be excellent. We are also seeing signs of corporate demand returning which we believe will continue to improve given the age of the corporate PC fleet and the compelling ROI that our new generation of servers presents. 
Looking at the supply chain we continue to see aggregate inventories operating within normal, healthy ranges. Intel’s own inventory remains lean. OEM inventories are flat quarter-over-quarter and downstream channel inventories are also within normal ranges. We watch inventory levels and sell through activity very carefully and we remain comfortable with the supply chain conditions. 
In our manufacturing environment our factory teams have executed the ramp of our 32nm process superbly. We exceeded output expectations with lower costs than originally anticipated and are currently shipping over SKU’s on 32nm. 32nm is our fastest ramping process ever and I am pleased to note we are accelerating the ramp of our third and fourth 32nm factories faster than our original plan such that by early Q4 we will have four factories in production on 32nm. 
Lastly, we are excited about our next generation of processors, code named Sandy Bridge. We began volume sampling in Q1, shipping thousands of samples to a broad range of customers and are planning for volume production later this year. 
As we look forward we are optimistic about the prospects for our business for the rest of 2010 and beyond. Our product portfolio combined with our excellent execution and the ongoing benefits from restructuring have us positioned for continued profitable growth. This is a great way to begin 2010 and I look forward to seeing many of you here in May for our Investor Meeting where we will talk in more detail about how we plan to build on this momentum and further exploit the growth opportunities before us. 
With that let me turn the meeting back over to Stacy. 
Stacy Smith 

Thanks Paul. The strength in our business model can be seen in the first quarter results. Record first quarter revenue of $10.3 billion resulted in record first quarter operating profit of $3.4 billion and cash flow from operations of approximately $4 billion. 
These better than expected financials resulted from strong sales of our new products. Micro processing unit sales declined slightly less than seasonal and average selling prices for microprocessors were up slightly quarter-over-quarter. Supply chain inventory levels appear to be healthy after several quarters of replenishment. The mobile computing segment was particularly strong with customer demand for our new products leading to an increase in mobile microprocessor average selling prices and record mobile microprocessor revenue. 
First quarter gross margin of 63.4% was higher than our expectation. The factory network performed well in the first quarter ramping 32nm process technology, controlling costs and reacting quickly to meet customer demand. The first quarter demonstrates the impact of our work in improving our cost structure. Spending was 30% of revenue and operating profit of $3.4 billion was 33% of revenue. The number of employees was approximately flat in the first quarter with revenue per employee of $129,000, the third highest in our history. 
Moving to the balance sheet, total cash investments comprised of cash, short-term investments and trading assets ended the quarter at $16.3 billion, $2.4 billion higher than the fourth quarter. Cash flow from operations was approximately $4 billion. During the first quarter we paid nearly $900 million in dividends and purchased over $900 million in capital assets. 
We are forecasting a revenue decrease for the second quarter that is slightly less than our average seasonal decline, taking the midpoint of our forecast range to $10.2 billion, a 27% increase from the second quarter of 2009. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range to increase 1 point from the first quarter to 64%. For 2010 we are now forecasting a record annual gross margin with the midpoint of our annual forecast increasing from 61% to 64%. 
The investments we are making in leading edge process technology, the strength of our product line, a continued focus on our cost structure and strong worldwide demand led to the record results we saw in the first quarter and the record financial results we are forecasting for the second quarter and the year. 
With that let me turn it back to Kevin. 
R. Kevin Sellers 

Thanks. We are now going to move to Q&A. We would like to limit each of you to one question and then a follow-up if you have one. With that, please go ahead and introduce our first question. 
Question and Answer Session

Operator

(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of John Pitzer - Credit Suisse. 
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
My first question, Q2 gross margins and full-year gross margins both being down about the same level of 64%. Help me understand the puts and takes in the back half of the year that prevent you from getting better margin leverage. 
Stacy Smith 

Sure. Let me start by giving, as you say, a bit of detail about the puts and takes. First off first half gross margin a little bit below 64%. We have 64% for the year. So the math gets you to some modest increase in gross margin in the second half over and above the kind of record gross margin levels we are achieving in the first half. As I think about the second half let’s first focus on the Core business. I expect that to be slightly positive to gross margin. I think we will see increasing volume that helps a bit. We are going to see a decrease in costs. That helps a bit. Offset a little bit by a decrease in average selling prices kind of a less than what you would normally see decrease in selling prices. 
The combination of that makes that slightly positive. I also expect in the second half of this year to have a little bit of a lower startup cost environment so those two things are positive. Then offsetting some of that is an increase in write offs. We will be building, as Paul said, the Sandy Bridge product. That is the new micro-architecture that lands on 32nm. So in the context of Tick/Tock that would be the Tock. As you saw with Westmere, the product we built prior to qualification for sale will be written off. So we will see a little bit of an increase in the second half of the year and that offsets some of the positives that I mentioned. 
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
You talked about signs of corporate coming back. Is that just in the server business where you have had some strength for a couple of quarters now or are you starting to see it on the client side? Can you give us a bit more detail there. That would be helpful. 
Paul Otellini 

It is the first quarter where we have seen some real signs of PC purchases, corporate SKU’s picking back up again. Some of that was wrapped around our new products, the Arrandale notebook products, but some of that was also even just some of our older SKU’s that are classic running corporate SKU’s also picked up. To me that suggests the average fleet of notebooks is four years old out there. The average fleet of desktops is five years old. You are getting to the point where as CIO’s are feeling a bit better about their business it makes economic sense to swap these out just from an ongoing cost of ownership standpoint. 
Operator

The next question comes from the line of Glen Young – Citi. 
Glen Young – Citi 
Can you address a little bit, you said supply conditions you face both in front and back-end, particularly moving into the back half of the year and demand picks up? 
Stacy Smith 

The Intel supply? 
Glen Young – Citi 
Yes. 
Stacy Smith 

We are ramping the 32nm factories as fast as we can and faster than we first expected. In fact, in the first quarter we ended up shipping more 32nm microprocessors than we first planned, principally driven by demand for those products and I guess the overall health of the business environment in general which was not planned a quarter ago. Looking forward we will use a combination of the four 32nm factories and our existing 45nm factories to be able to satisfy I think any demand scenario you could imagine out there. 
In terms of other’s peoples supply which is what I thought you were hinting at first, I really don’t see any fundamental constraints. If I look at all of the pieces and the components that go together in terms of the memory, screens, batteries and so forth, that would retard the industry’s ability to meet most any demand scenario. 
Glen Young – Citi 
Cash levels you are at now, you are not that far off of your records which I think were set back in 2004. Particularly with no change in CapEx, any thoughts about and I assume cash is going to keep growing, any thoughts about uses of cash? 
Stacy Smith 

You are absolutely right. The strength of our business, as Paul said, surprised us the strength of cash generation was also surprising. What you should take from the fact we have been doing minimal buybacks over the last year is we are growing our cash balance. Frankly we are looking at some strategic investments and evaluating those and in that context we are growing the cash balances and we are comfortable with the levels of cash we have. 
The priority in terms of capital structure in terms of returning cash to the shareholders is the dividend. You saw us increase that in Q4. We have had multiple years where we have increased the dividend without fail. Just putting it into context I think from 2006 I think our dividend per share was about $0.40 per share. Based on the increase we just did we are at $0.63 per share so a nice increase in the dividend over time and that continues to be the priority. 
Operator

The next question comes from the line of Chris Stanley [ph] – JP Morgan. 

Chris Stanley – JP Morgan
On the end markets and demand trends it sounds like consumer was very strong in Q4 and then corporate kind of kicked in Q1. When you talk to your customers what do you expect and what do they expect in terms of demand trends between corporate versus consumer for the rest of the year? What would be the implications for your business? 
Paul Otellini 

You are right, consumer has been the driver I think throughout this cycle. Not just in the fourth quarter of last year but I think I talked last year about China in particular in the early part of last year and then the United States and Europe in the second half of last year. I think the overall shift to mobility is one of the megatrends that is out there both from a consumer standpoint and from the corporate standpoint. 
The first quarter and even our first half numbers I think are buoyed by a combination of things. A very healthy China and Chinese New Year scenario. I think the new products we have launched have pretty compelling pull at the end market level. Simplified branding, lots of really good features, etc. and lastly now you are starting to see some corporate PC purchases re-emerge. I am still not going to go out on a limb and our customers certainly aren’t going to go out on a limb and say there is a corporate refresh snapback coming. I think what we see this cycle is much more people are buying things to replace older machines because it is just cheaper. 
They are doing that on their budgets as they free up a bit more money here and there. I think they will also make the tradeoffs between PCs and Servers and software as they go forward and right now hardware seems to be doing pretty well in that tradeoff. 
Chris Stanley – JP Morgan

If we plug in the gross margin guidance it sounds like your gross margin in the second half of this year is going to get back to the peak of last year in Q4. Should we consider that 65% a peak number? If you have some more higher write offs at the end of this year is that a good thing for next year? Will the write offs be lower next year because [inaudible]. 
Stacy Smith 

Two very different questions. In terms of the gross margin forecast this year of 64% that is an annual record. You are right. We will likely have some quarters above that. I think you are really asking does it change my long-term view of the gross margin profile of the company. If you harkens back to a year ago as Paul said, the depth of the recession when we were down in the mid 40’s I articulated the normal range of being between 50-60%. I think we spent one quarter in that normal range and we have been above it every quarter since. This year it looks like we will be above it every quarter. 
On that question I think I will defer answering it until we get to the Investor Meeting. I think that is a much better platform for talking about how we are looking at longer term gross margin trends. To the more tactical part of that there will be lots of puts and takes to the H111 [ph] gross margin but yes you would expect to see the inventory we write off prior to qualification for sale assuming that ends up being sellable inventory will be a benefit to gross margin when we get into the subsequent quarters. 
Now that is one of many elements. That element would likely be positive assuming that qualification goes as we expect it to and as prior qualifications have gone. 
Operator

The next question comes from the line of Tim Luke - Barclays Capital. 
Tim Luke - Barclays Capital 
Framing the environment you had several very quarters. A very strong fourth quarter and strong first quarter. You are now guiding for a slightly firmer than seasonal second calendar quarter off a pretty high base. Can you give us your sense of your visibility on that, slightly better than seasonal guide for the second calendar quarter and what elements are likely to contribute to that? Is it the PCs still that are leading? Is it the servers? Is it all of the above? 
Paul Otellini 

I think it is certainly PC driven but I think there are other things woven into it. We are still in the very steep part of the ramp on the 32nm. Bringing it into the product line there is still, as I said earlier, a lot of pull for that product. We were slightly behind quite frankly satisfying all the demand our customers wanted on 32nm in the first quarter even though we were producing much more than we first thought. We expect to catch up to that demand in the second quarter on 32nm over the course of the quarter. I think part of that is just the excitement around the new products on the PC side. Number one. 
Number two, the Nehalem EX product which is our new multi-processing product began shipping in the last two weeks of the quarter. I think that will have a full quarter effect. So far there are something like 30 systems that have been announced and the receptivity and pent up demand for that I think is very good. So you get a combination of those things all driven by new products that I think will give us that better than seasonality picture we are painting. 
Tim Luke - Barclays Capital 
As you go into the second half of the year do you think you will be able given the stronger first half to sustain what you might frame as normal seasonality broadly for the second half of the year or do you think like with it so strong at the beginning of the year we should be modeling a slightly lower than seasonal uptick or not given it sounds like you think corporate is going to come back? 
Paul Otellini 

I kind of thought you would go there on your third round. As you can imagine I am going to duck it. I think we won’t talk about the second half at this point in time except to say we are putting in place sufficient capacity to handle, as I said earlier, any demand scenario you could imagine. We are assuming continued growth and units over the course of the year. We are going to be ramping 32nm as fast as possible. So the only question we have from a supply standpoint is how much 45 we keep on and what is our assembly test loading capabilities. We will put some bucks around those to make sure we have sufficient capacity. 
Tim Luke - Barclays Capital 

Better than seasonal possibly even given your focus on capacity rather than…
Paul Otellini 

I didn’t go there.

The next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy – Thomas Weisel Partners. 
Kevin Cassidy – Thomas Weisel Partners
Could you describe the mix in the servers? Was it a richer mix and just slower units? 
Paul Otellini 

In Q1 the mix is a little less rich than Q4. I think there are a couple of things going on there. First is what we saw a pickup in what we call the transactional business. This has tends to be unit processor servers on the Nehalem parts that are sold by both the channel and our OEM customers typically into a small and medium business environment. So I think that is a good sign we haven’t seen that kind of demand profile before in the transactional volume. Not in the last half of 2009. The fact that came back was one of the positive signs leading us to the guidance we gave for Q2. 
I think we also I think there was as people moved towards the transition from the older multi-processing line to the newer multi-processing line they basically thinned down their inventories in anticipation of the launch of the EX. Now we will have a full quarter to ship in Q2 with that product line. 
Kevin Cassidy – Thomas Weisel Partners
You had mentioned corporate demand coming back on the client side. Do you see that as lagging from the server strength you saw in fourth quarter or are they not related? 
Paul Otellini 

I would like to think people are looking at these things with a clear economic eye. If you look at it with a clear economic eye you would refresh the servers first. That builds your infrastructure up. It gives you the fastest return on investment. You probably can squeak out another quarter or so with your PC fleet and I also think that corporations are likely to deploy Win7 so people have to qualify that and get the SKU’s ready and I think that is what is happening now. I don’t think it was really a lag effect. I tend to think of it as much more of a clear view of what the return on investment was versus the cost savings of replacing the PC that you are now seeing a bit more latitude on.

The next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann – Raymond James.
Hans Mosesmann – Raymond James 
A question on notebook mix. Has the netbook dynamic slowed down or saturated as a percentage of total mobile? 
Paul Otellini 

It depends on the granularity of the question. If you look at it in terms of the total year last year and our view for the total year this year we really don’t see a change. I think we suggested that netbooks seem to be settling out at about 20% of the mobile form factors and on an annual basis that looks to be about right. I would expect pretty significant year-over-year growth in the netbook business. I think netbooks in general have become, though they are by definition a consumer purchase, there is no corporate netbook market we have found. It was pretty robust in the fourth quarter. You had a lot of new entrants come into the marketplace. Large companies really coming in for the first time. I think seasonality plus maybe a bit of the overhang from a number of the players coming in the fourth quarter as what we saw in Q1 where Atom was down a bit more than what we would normally see as seasonal. 
Hans Mosesmann – Raymond James 
What is the company position with tablets? It seems to be a big emerging category. What is your strategy there? 
Paul Otellini 

I think that is a great question and I think at this point I view tablets much like I viewed netbooks two years ago which is that was a new category then that was market expansive. I think tablets will also be a new category that will also likely be market expansive. If I look forward over the course of the year particularly at Computex coming up the first week of June. We have a lot of our customers announcing new tablet form factors around Morristown versions of Atom and in their support for a multitude of operating environments. You will see products on Android, on Windows 7 and on MiGO.

The next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis - Morgan Stanley. 
Mark Lipacis - Morgan Stanley
The client business was flat and I think if you look at least a couple of the larger North American PC OEM’s it seems like the forecast is for their client business is to decline a bit in the first calendar quarter. So I guess there are different ways to potentially that. Maybe they see upside like you guys did. Maybe they are building or replenishing inventories or there is another set of OEMs that are perhaps benefiting from the growth dynamics. Can you share with us your thoughts about how we might think about that difference in expectations? 
Paul Otellini 

I don’t know I can help you a lot there except to say we were down. I am not sure that I followed how much their client business is forecasted to be down versus what you guys were doing but our business was down. It was better than seasonal but down. 
Stacy Smith 

On a unit basis it was slightly better than seasonal but not dramatically better. The benefit we really saw in the first quarter was in the mix and the price. 
Mark Lipacis - Morgan Stanley
On the data center business you gave some answers to that. What would be a normal 1Q for that business? 
Stacy Smith 

What you saw was pretty in line with what we would normally expect in terms of data center normal seasonality. 
Paul Otellini 

It is typically down about 8%. 
Stacy Smith 

8-9% is right where we were.

The next question comes from the line of James Covello - Goldman Sachs. 
James Covello - Goldman Sachs
Last quarter you were good enough to break out for us the change in unit inventory versus the change in dollar inventory. I was wondering if you could do that again for us this quarter. You said you wanted to build some inventory but you weren’t able to really build much. 
Stacy 

I would be happy to help there. The way you characterized it is the way I see it. Because of the increases we saw over the course of the quarter in demand on the new mobile platform Arrandale I wasn’t as able to get as much inventory in place as I had hoped. If you look at it between dollars and units what you see is units are up a bit more than dollars but still not as much as I would want as we kind of move into the second quarter and based on the strength we are seeing and the ramp of these new products. If you deconstruct the inventory between the processes what we saw was more than 100% of the increase in inventory and more than 100% of the increase in units was on 32nm. So we got a little bit in place there. Everything else was down. As I think about Q2 my hope is I can build some inventory into the second quarter in anticipation of a second half that is higher. 
James Covello - Goldman Sachs
You have started off the year believing that we were looking at sort of a mid-teens PC kind of year. If I put any kind of close to normal seasonality in your revenue for the back half of the year you would be up well into the 20’s. It certainly doesn’t seem like you are out-shipping demand because there is no wire [ph] in the supply chain that is putting in inventory. Is it safe to say your expectations then for the full-year PC number have come up a bit? 
Paul Otellini 

I think so. Everyone still wonders what the shape of this year looks like. I said earlier when I ducked Tim’s question I would reserve judgment on that. I think versus a quarter ago how could we have not taken our expectations up a bit for the year? 
Operator

The next question comes from the line of Patrick Wang – Wedbush Morgan. 
Patrick Wang – Wedbush Morgan 
You talked about accelerating the ramp of the third and fourth 32nm factories. Can you talk a little bit about the impact to your overall capacity there and when we can expect SBLI [ph]?
Stacy Smith 
All four factories will be online by early Q4. There is a ramp schedule that we are not making public on each specific factory. We pulled up the schedule a bit on the last two of the network. There is really no change in our CapEx spending as a result of that. These things are all being planned to be equipped and so forth. What we have done here is based upon the learnings and the yields we are seeing in the first two factories we have had higher confidence to be able to ramp to high volume faster on the next two. 
Patrick Wang – Wedbush Morgan 
I wanted to talk real quick about mix and ASP here. In the first quarter it looks like we saw some good news, a surprise just on higher ASPs. The second quarter you are guiding a little bit of a negative impact on lower platform ASP. Can you talk about what is going on there and perhaps maybe factor in the mix of the Core I3, I5 and I7? 
Stacy Smith 

I will take a shot at it. The surprise for us in Q1 was the strength of the new products as we had articulated a quarter ago. The way we are loading the factories is we are bringing out the high end of the product line first. I think what we saw in Q1 was a pretty rich mix and I expect as we go through the year it will be a more normal mix. I guess that is the contextual background of I am now expecting 2010 to be a year where ASPs come down some but less than what the long-term model would suggest. A fairly benign pricing environment overall but they will come down some from where we were in the first quarter is my prediction. 
Patrick Wang – Wedbush Morgan 
Care to offer any comment in terms of a mix up in Core, I3 and I5 and I7? 
Paul Otellini 

In general we are seeing great reception to the new Core products. Even within them certainly the first quarter the mix up to Core I5 versus I3 was very solid. Now as we bring on more capacity you get a more natural mix. I think you also will see our customers move towards taking those processors into lower price points. Price points where you would see Pentium products today over the course of the year. By tweaking the configurations a bit, maybe not using discrete graphics as much because the graphics on the Arrandale platform are so good. Maybe having less memory as Win7 runs pretty well on 2G etc. That will allow them to mix the SKU’s and keep the processor mix pretty good and keep a higher volume set of price points.

The next question comes from the line of Uche Orji – UBS. 
Uche Orji - UBS
Can I just go back to the PC inventory. I know you say you want to review the inventory again in Q2. But earlier in your remarks you described channel inventory as healthy. Is it possible for you to quantify what that means and also maybe put a bit of context around that so we can get a handle on what you mean as healthy channel inventory? 
Stacy Smith 

I want to be careful we don’t mix the two things. My answer I think was in regard to our component inventory the channel inventory comments that Paul and I both made were in regards to the inventory we see downstream from us. It is the inventory held at the multinationals, the retailers, the ODMs, our own distributors. So that downstream inventory when we look at it, it looks healthy and it looks appropriate to demand levels. Our internal inventories are lower than I would like particularly on the new 32nm products. We were tight in Q1. We would normally want to buffer that transition a bit by having some inventory in place particularly if we are going into a higher selling season in the back half it is prudent to get some inventory in place. 
Uche Orji - UBS
In terms of the channel, what I really wanted to know was if there was a way to quantify that in terms of weeks or days [inaudible] handle on it? 
Paul Otellini 

We don’t have insight into everything. That is why you see us hesitating here. In terms of the microprocessor inventories that are in our channel and in our OEM customers that we have visibility into we see nothing out of line and everything is consistent with the build plans and transition plans over the next couple of quarters. We also monitor the shipping lanes and those kinds of things and what comes out of Taiwan on boats versus air. Again, we don’t really see any fundamental shift there. Nor do we see anything that is out of line on the assumption there is growth in units over the course of the year. 
Uche Orji - UBS
On service, I wanted to ask you when I look at service the one key thing if you look at the value [inaudible] LMEX, and CIO’s are talking about replacing many of their old servers with one. What is your sense of the size of this market going forward? You are delivering so much ROI to your customers. Do we have a situation where the market itself will shrink and Intel doesn’t get enough runway or growth in this business given the value you are delivering to your customers? Any sense on how we can [inaudible]. 
Paul Otellini 

We haven’t even gotten close to finding a fundamental limiter on that. There are a number of things going on. The move to cloud we think is very good. Not everything will go to cloud but the shift to cloud base services is good for Intel. The shift to virtualization is good for Intel. If you look and plot out, and we will do this at the analyst meeting in much more detail but if you plot out the growth in data traffic and network traffic and the kinds of things modern servers are doing that growth curve is faster than the refresh rate for old versus new equipment. We see a very robust scenario for servers going forward.

The next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon – Sanford Bernstein. 
Stacy Rasgon – Sanford Bernstein 
One more on ASPs for the full-year. You basically have cut the ASP impact on gross margin from your previous guidance by about half. I think before it was thought 2-3 points and now it is about 1.5 points. Can you give a little more color on what is driving that differential? Is it just continued uptick of 32nm faster than you thought? Is it more servers? More corporate? Less Atom? 
Stacy Smith 

You have the math exactly right. The margin recon [ph] I gave you a quarter ago…I was articulating that I expected 2-3 points from 2009 to 2010 based on ASP coming down. Based on the strength we saw in Q1 and the take up of new products we have cut that impact in half. It is really those two things. The strength we saw in Q1 and the take up of the new products has exceeded my expectations and I think some of that strength will continue through the year. 
Stacy Rasgon – Sanford Bernstein 
A quick question on OpEx. I know you took that up a little bit. It looks like you took up R&D about $200 million and SG&A up about $400 million at the midpoint of your guidance. Can you give us a little more color on what is driving the increases in both of those and in particular the greater increase in SG&A versus R&D? 
Stacy Smith 

Let me take a different shot at the explanation. I think it gets you there. If you look at it from the prior forecast we are up about $600 million cycle on cycle. About half of that is profit and revenue dependent spending. What you take from that is as we have seen the Q1 results and have increased our expectations for the year I am expecting more revenue, more profit that is driving those two line items. The revenue dependent spending is almost all marketing. It is Intel Inside so it gets categorized as marketing spending. The product dependent spending gets split across the different groups of the company. So that is about half of the increase. 
Behind that we have some incremental investments we are making. Those are predominately R&D projects. Again as our confidence in the year has gone up there are some projects we are launching there. Then the third element behind that is again an increase to marketing. We have gone through and redesigned some of our customer programs and in the process of redesigning those programs they will be categorized going forward as marketing expense. So that is the other element there.

The next question comes from the line of David Wong – Wells Fargo. 
David Wong – Wells Fargo 
You brought up Nehalem EX. Are you seeing signs that MP server chip volumes are picking up? Would you expect those to grow faster than the dual processor does over the next couple of quarters? 
Paul Otellini 

No I don’t think so. I think the value proposition is different in different markets. Right? So I would expect the dual processor products will continue to be, let me say the topography of choice for data center build out for the big internet portal guys. You can imagine who I am talking about. The MP Server configurations tend to be much more I think you will see them much more prevalent in the corporate environment and SAP configurations and people don’t want to run multiple applications in a virtual mode there. I really think they are addressing different market segments as they ramp up. We love both of our children here and I don’t think I see a difference in the curves between the two of them. 
David Wong – Wells Fargo 
Intel Capital. You have an improving overall environment. Should we start to see gains from equity investments over the coming year as we [inaudible] pipeline of private investments that might be getting ready for IPO? 
Stacy Smith 

For obvious reasons I won’t answer the second part of the question. It is their job to tell you about when they are thinking about an IPO. I would say generally the answer to your question is yes. I think the improvement we have seen over the last few quarters has really been a decrease in the rate in which investments were being impaired. As I think forward over the next year I would expect to start to see some gains and some exits coming in. Nothing on the radar for Q2 but look out longer term that would be my expectation. We invest in Intel Capital portfolio companies for two reasons. 
One is to get strategic benefit to the overall business. The other is to get a return. The expectation is we are doing both of those things.

The next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore – Deutsche Bank. 
Ross Seymore – Deutsche Bank 
Earlier you were kind enough to give us what normal seasonality is in the data center business for the first quarter. Can you let us know what it is for the remainder of the year on a normal basis and how Nehalem might impact that? 
Stacy Smith 

I don’t have that number at my fingertips. Let’s put this in the category of taking a wild ass guess. Having run Intel IT, Paul is cringing, I think we probably see the way that IT budgets work if you likely see spending on server infrastructure that is probably stronger in Q4 than it is in any other quarter. You probably saw the kind of reduction we saw this quarter where it is down some. So it is going to be somewhat back-end loaded. To get to the quarter by quarter split I don’t have that number at my finger. 
Ross Seymore – Deutsche Bank 
Shifting gears a little to the inventory side, now that your manufacturing cycle times are about half of what they were in the hubbed amount of your business is larger than it has been, what impact does that have on the amount of inventory you actually need to have to service demand and can you frankly just operate leaner than you have ever done in the past? 
Stacy Smith 

Keep in mind the two things you mentioned will move in opposite directions. The hub, what it does is you will tend to see less overall inventory through the supply chain but more of that inventory on my books because I am holding that at the customer location. The reduction in cycle times obviously allows us to operate at leaner levels. Net of those two things I think you are going to continue to see us like we have been over the last 4-5 quarters, operating at pretty efficient inventory levels. I want to caution you though that won’t preclude the need to get inventory in place when we are going through big product transitions or process technology transitions. It is the prudent thing to do to get inventory in place and that is what we tried to do in Q1 and what we will try again to do in Q2.

The next question comes from the line of Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Merrill Lynch. 
Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Merrill Lynch 
You have done a great job with the ASPs the last couple of quarters but at the same time you are expecting some kind of a modest decline in the back half of the year. I am curious as to why you think that will be the case given your comments of signs of a corporate recovery, servers should be seasonally strong in the back half of the year. Is it just Core I3 being a bigger part of the mix? Can you help us understand what is the thought process there is? 
Stacy Smith 

It really is the function of we had a very rich mix in Q4 and Q1 as we were launching the first products on 32nm. I expect that to be a more normal mix as we progress through the year. Again that is against the backdrop of an ASP that is down some but less than it is normally down. So it is as simple as that. If you zoom way out on this what we see over time is Moore’s law allows us to bring in new features, bring our costs down. We also bring prices down over time. That drives the elasticity in demand. You see it in the consumer segment of the market. You see it in emerging markets. That ends up being an important growth driver for the business. Against that backdrop we are having a pretty benign pricing environment this year based on the strength of our product portfolio is how I would characterize it. 
Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Merrill Lynch 
Any chance you could take a shot at quantifying the impact of the inventory write offs you expect to have? Sandy Bridge is that same 2-3 point impact you typically see, for example as when you transition to 32nm last year? Or was it some different amount we should be thinking about? 
Stacy Smith 

I am not going to get to that level of granularity because we haven’t given specific quarter by quarter forecasts. I expect it to be a little bit of a negative impact in the back half of this year but frankly none of the elements I was articulating were in the magnitude of 3-4 points. I am not expecting it to be that big. 
Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Merrill Lynch 
You think it is a Q3 as opposed to Q4 phenomenon or you can’t tell us that yet? 
Stacy Smith 

It is a back half phenomenon. It actually probably will be across both quarters based on where we are in the cycle for that product.

The next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman – Broadpoint. 
Doug Freedman - Broadpoint
A year ago you talked about the mix of products really being important to margins. Can you talk about Atom and Atom chipset margins compared with Quad Core and if that whole ratio calculation you put up for us if that is played out the way you expected or if there has been any derivations from that? 
Stacy Smith 

On that one I will show you in much more detail next month when we are together for the investor meeting. Directionally it has played out exactly as I anticipated. Costs came down. It is a very healthy product margin. I showed a comparison of Atom to the Core business excluding Atom and to the embedded business and got into a fairly similar range. That is how it is played out from a product margin percent standpoint which is how I think you asked the question, right? 
Doug Freedman - Broadpoint
Yes. Sticking with Atom as the theme there is some concern in the marketplace and is relevant from your numbers in Q1 that Atom didn’t really sell as well in the quarter, earlier in the call you mentioned it was related to seasonality and the over exuberance of the marketplace to many new entrants. Is there something you can do with Atom pricing to re-invigorate those sales? Is that something you would look to do or what is your strategy should Atom not sell as well as expected throughout the balance of the year? 
Paul Otellini 

There is Atom in netbooks and then there is Atom going into other products. Atom going into other products is design cycle and you will see other kinds of products with Atom in it over the course of this year. Someone asked a question earlier about tablets and there is rumor out there about certain consumer electronics equipment, phones and things like that. 
That is not really the heart of the question. The heart of the question is netbooks. As I said earlier I still think there will be significant growth in the netbook business year-over-year. I think that there are rather than pricing I think we would look to features and integration as a technical novelty or twist here. The next innovation coming out on Atom is Dual Core which comes out in the second quarter. So that will ramp for the holiday season this year and I think that will be a very attractive product. Then in early Q1 we have another integration at much lower power product coming out that is a derivative of it for fanless netbook business. You will see us use technology to make the platform a bit better each time or to integrate more features and make it cheaper.

The next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria – RBC Capital Markets. 
Mahesh Sanganeria – RBC Capital Markets 
I will just ask one long question instead of two questions. If you could give us an update on wireless display how the adoption has been? I think the current price point for the SKU’s is $900. Do you see that coming to $600-700 range by back to school? Also what the competitive response has been from AMD and Invidia on this product? 
Paul Otellini 

I can’t comment on the price points as our customers set those price points. What I can say is first WiDi products have been very well received. It is selling through the channel nicely at Best Buy which is where it is semi-exclusive right now. Over the course of the year you will see many more SKUs and many more distributors picking up the product. I think it will be a must-have feature for holiday timeframe. It may come down in price a bit but generally speaking I think it is going to get broader before it gets a lot cheaper. In terms of other vendors trying to do similar technology I would say good luck. This took us quite awhile to be able to develop and to be able to get this done. We have a roadmap of features that take WiDi in a better over time that adds more content protection, Blue Ray support, etc., etc. So this is one where being out early and doing a lot of the work at the platform level and the software level and then having a feature roadmap I think really is what makes us compelling.

Welcome to the Q4 2009 Intel Corporation earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today’s call, Mr. Kevin Sellers, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir. 
R. Kevin Sellers

Thank you and welcome everyone to Intel's fourth quarter 2009 earnings conference call. I am joined today as usual by our Chief Executive Officer, Paul Otellini and Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith. Our earnings release and updated financial statements were released today at approximately 1:15 PDT and can be found on our investor website, intc.com. 

This quarter we continued the practice that we started last quarter of posting additional management commentary from CFO Stacy Smith to our investor website. This commentary was posted at approximately 1:30 p.m. PDT and contains added detail about our quarterly performance that was previously reviewed in prepared remarks during our conference call. 
As we begin our call, let me remind everyone that today’s discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. If during our call today there are any non-GAAP financial references made, we will post the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliations on our investor website. 
So with that, let me hand it over to Paul for some comments followed by brief remarks from Stacy. Paul?

Paul Otellini 

Thanks, Kevin. Our fourth quarter results cap a great year of execution and innovation for Intel. We started the year in one of the deepest recessions in our history and emerged from it with better products and technology driving new demand for computing worldwide. 
Our restructuring efforts have born real fruit by improving the operational efficiency of the company, driving relatively good results in challenging times and exceptional results in a stronger market. The demand picture in the quarter reflected broad based strength across all regions and all product categories with notebooks leading the way. Our product mix was also a notable highlight. Demand for our latest generation of processors, both PC and server, was particularly strong providing an ASP uplift in the quarter. 
Inventory levels remain in good shape with OEM component inventories roughly flat quarter-over-quarter and below levels of a year ago. Distributor inventories are down sequentially. The combination of much stronger sell through and lower year-over-year inventory levels gives us comfort that the supply chain continues to operate very efficiently. 
Looking across our product segments servers had a very strong quarter. The value proposition of Nehalem is clearly evident and we are seeing a demand shift towards the high end of the performance stack, improving average selling prices. Looking ahead over the next three months we are planning to refresh our entire server product line with the new 32nm Xeon in the single, dual and multiprocessor segments. 
It is noteworthy to point out that the Nehalem EX, our multiprocessor version, represents the biggest leap in performance in the history of the Xeon brand. We remain in an excellent position to benefit from the build out of cloud infrastructure as well as the reconfiguration of existing space centers for power performance efficiency improvements. 

Our Atom processor business also continues to do very well both in netbooks as well as in winning new designs for our growth initiatives. Atom design momentum is very strong with our new Pine Trail platform in over 80 netbook designs. In the embedded space we now have over 600 Atom based design wins and over 2,500 design engagements across 230 customers, 93 of which are brand new customers to Intel. 
At CES we also demonstrated progress with handheld and consumer electronics platforms built around Atom cores that were very well received. We demonstrated for the first time the LG GW990, a smart phone built with our yet to be released Atom Moorestown platform which was awarded Best Smart Phone of the show. This demonstrates the power of our architecture in bringing an uncompromising computing experience to handheld devices. Expect more meaningful news and announcements around these businesses during 2010. 
Our notebook business was exceptional this quarter with demand very strong across the globe. We have been carefully preparing for the shift to mobile and our product strategy is a reflection of that. To further enhance our PC lineup, at CES we formally launched 27 new processors produced with our leading edge 32 nm process technology, the biggest consumer launch of new processors since Centrino. 
Our new core processors are the first ever mainstream PC processors to integrate the graphics engine onto the CPU. This is Moore’s law at work driving increased performance and improved power and foreign factor characteristics to our new platforms. Our new graphics engine is notable in that it offers full HD video, great mainstream gaming and enhanced 3D capability. I am happy to report that early demand for these products is excellent. 
In closing, we had an outstanding quarter and enter 2010 in a very strong position. We have delivered breakthroughs  in our product offerings and our competitive positioning through the Tick Tock development model. Our recently launched 32 nm process technology is the critical process capability that will not only bring computing to new levels but also allow us to broadly offer Atom system on chips into many new product categories. We are pleased with our current momentum and look forward to an exciting year in 2010. 
With that let me turn the time over to Stacy for a few comments. 
Stacy Smith 

Thanks Paul. The fourth quarter was one of our most profitable quarters ever due to a combination of solid execution, the ramp of innovative new products and a healthy consumer market. 
Fourth quarter revenue of $10.6 billion was up 28% from a year ago, the largest year-over-year percent increase in more than a decade. Our financial results reflect both significant improvements in our cost structure and higher microprocessor average selling prices. The impact of these improvements can be seen in the gross margin percent of 65% which was up 7 points from the third quarter and is the highest gross margin percent in our history. 
In the fourth quarter we achieved $2.5 billion in operating profit and $2.3 billion in net income. The PC market has recovered nicely with our microprocessor revenue excluding Atom growing 42% since the market bottomed in the first quarter. In the same time period, Atom microprocessors and associated chip sets have grown to $438 million in revenue in the fourth quarter and $1.4 billion for the year. 
Fourth quarter gross margin benefited from lower inventory write offs, improving costs and our exceptional product line up as we ramped and sold the first products manufactured on our 32 nm process technology. Total inventories increased $450 million due to these new 32 nm products. 
For 2009 gross margin was 56% including a 20 point increase from Q1 to Q4. For 2010 we are forecasting continued strong gross margin with the midpoint of our annual forecast at 61%. As a result of capital reuse and achieving efficiencies we were able to ramp 32 nm process technology and still bring down our capital forecast from our expectation at the beginning of the year. 
Our capital purchases for the year of $4.5 billion is down from our original forecast of around $5.2 billion and was less than the annual depreciation run rate. Operating expenses remain in tight control. This is most clearly seen in spending as a percent of revenue. In the fourth quarter spending for R&D and MG&A as a percent of revenue remained constant at 29%, down from 35% in the first quarter and 32% in the second quarter. 
The number of employees decreased by 1,000 people in the fourth quarter as a result of planned factory actions announced early in 2009. Revenue per employee for the year was $440,000, the third highest in our history. 
The fourth quarter of 2009 demonstrates the strength of our execution and business model. Excluding the impact of the $1.25 billion AMD settlement agreement taken in the fourth quarter operating profit was quarterly record $3.7 billion and as a percent of revenue was 35%. Total cash investments comprised of cash, short-term investments and debt security trading assets ended the quarter at $13.9 billion, $1 billion higher than the third quarter. 
Cash flow from operations was more than $3 billion. During the fourth quarter we paid the AMD settlement agreement, paid nearly $800 million in dividends and purchased $1.1 billion in capital assets. 
For the first quarter we are forecasting a seasonal decrease in revenue, taking the midpoint of our forecast range to $9.7 billion, a 36% increase in the first quarter of 2009. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range to decrease four points from the fourth quarter to 61%. In addition to the impact of the unit decline, the decrease is primarily due to the higher costs associated with the early ramp of the 32 nm based products. 
The fourth quarter was a strong finish to what turned out to be a good year. The improvements we have made to our cost structure and efficiency levels have led to exceptional financial results in the fourth quarter and served as a strong foundation upon which we can build in 2010 as we refresh our product line and ramp 32 nm process technology. 
With that let me turn it back to Kevin. 
R. Kevin Sellers 

Thanks Stacy and Paul. We would now be happy to take your questions. As most of you know, Intel has a large number of analysts that cover our company. Like we did last quarter and in an effort to include as many of you as we can, we will be limiting each caller to one question only. If you need clarification on that question do please ask. We want to make sure we answer your question adequately but please no follow-up’s and no multi part questions. Operator, go ahead and introduce the first question. 
Question and Answer Session 

Operator

(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore – Deutsche Bank. 
Ross Seymore – Deutsche Bank 

A question on what your mix assumptions are for your first quarter and full year 2010 gross margin guidance? 
Stacy Smith 

Let me start with what we saw in the fourth quarter. I think that kind of serves as a baseline and then we will talk about Q1 and 2010. What we saw in the fourth quarter was really a very rich mix. We saw strength across the board on our new products and in particular what we saw was as we took first production on 32 nm we filled from the top. There was good market acceptance of those products. So a combination of that led to a rich mix in the fourth quarter. 
I expect that comes back down into a more normal mix range as we go across 2010. In particular we will be bringing out mainstream and value versions of the 32 nm products and that should say that the sales mix gets into a more normal range as we progress across the next several quarters. 
Ross Seymore – Deutsche Bank 
And that will offset any of the enterprise improving year-over-year? 
Stacy Smith 

From an overall average selling price standpoint for 2010 we are predicting kind of a normal decline year-over-year. Keep in mind we have lots of things that go up and down. We will have a rich mix in the beginning of enterprise coming in but at the end of the day we do bring pricing down because we see unit growth potential in the consumer segment of the market and emerging markets. There is price elasticity there so that is kind of consistent with what you have seen from us the last several years. The price comes down, we drive unit growth with that and that ends up driving incremental gross margin dollars. 
Operator

The next question comes from the line of Tim Luke - Barclays Capital. 
Tim Luke - Barclays Capital 
I was wondering if you could clarify how you perceive you would like your inventory levels to trend as you move through the first quarter and through the year. If you could provide any incremental color on the mix of the inventory that seemed to move up somewhat in the calendar fourth quarter with your stronger revenue. 
Stacy Smith 

In Q4 it pretty much unfolded as we expected and as articulated on the last call. We saw an increase in inventory entirely due to the new 32 nm product. If you look at it on a unit basis it is pretty much flat quarter on quarter but we did have the cost associated with 32 nm, those early wafers tend to be pretty high cost products and as you have seen us do in prior transitions of new process technology we pretty quickly build inventory on the new stuff. You saw it in Q4. I expect to build a little bit more inventory in Q1 as I ramp 32 nm products. It won’t be the same magnitude we saw this quarter but it will be up some. Then it starts looking a little more normal as it progresses through the year relative to demand. But this is what we do as we ramp a new process technology. It is pretty normal and it is consistent with what I was expecting when I started the quarter. 
Tim Luke - Barclays Capital 
I think you said your channel inventory was flat in the [inaudible] and the comment on the OEM inventory could you just reiterate that? 
Paul Otellini 

I think I said it was down sequentially. Of our product. 
Tim Luke - Barclays Capital 
And the OEMs? 
Paul Otellini 

I think you will have to ask the OEMs on their call. Our view are complementary [inventory] in the hubs and the see through to the hubs we have suggests that they are roughly flat quarter-over-quarter and well under a year ago. 
Stacy Smith 

If you just kind of step back on this one when we look across the supply chain, it is a very complex supply chain, so looking at our authorized channel those inventories are down and visibility into a lot of the OEM inventories and a lot of that is now held in our hub and what we see in the down channel so retail, the shipping lanes and stuff, what we see is a healthy level of inventory relative to the demand we see out over the next couple of quarters. 
Paul Otellini 

I would add two things. One is our largest two customers have their quarters ending in January. Secondly, Chinese New Year is a bit earlier this year. 
Operator

The next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis - Morgan Stanley. 
Mark Lipacis - Morgan Stanley
You have three quarters in a row of double digit growth. I just went back to the model and I had to go back to the late 80’s I think to see that. I guess a lot of people are probably going to be wondering what happens next. You talk about the inventory and I guess my question is can you help us understand what percentage of your revenues where you have visibility into the inventories? Can you see pretty much 100% of the inventory at every place you sell into? Does the release of your products in Q1 of the new product cycle in Q1 versus Q3 does that risk changing any kind of customer order patterns? 
Paul Otellini 

I got a little lost in the question there. Let me take a shot and if I missed something you asked we will come back to it. The part of your question on what is our visibility into the supply chain, it is not perfect. It is a broad complex market out there that ranges from emerging markets with small white box players to big [MNCs]. I would say it is pretty good. We have I think a fairly sophisticated way to look across and see how much inventory is out there. Relative to what we believe demand is I think it is an appropriate level of inventory. 
Stacy Smith 

A little more color on that our distributor inventory we have 100% visibility into and that is about 25-30% of our business in units and dollars so that is the number I gave that was down sequentially. The OEM inventory we have hub systems with our largest customers representing the vast majority of our OEM volume and so you are dealing with something well above 50%. I don’t know the exact numbers but I expect in the aggregate between OEM hubs and distribution it is 75% of the numbers. So we have very good visibility into it. On the Q1 cycle we actually moved towards a Q1 refresh cycle quite some time ago. 
It was better for our customers. They liked it. They don’t want to have a disruption before holiday so it either is in the early summer, late Q2, or is in January and February. That works out best for them in terms of inventory management and gets new products out there for what is becoming a big part of the cycle, and that is Chinese New Year’s.

The next question comes from the line of Uche Orji – UBS. 
Uche Orji - UBS
A way to understand your 2010 outlook especially related to gross margin, given the way 2009 played out what is your sense as to how 2010 seasonality will play out especially if you can touch on corporate spending since we saw it flush in Q4. Should we anticipate some more spending from corporate in the future? 
Paul Otellini 

I don’t know how it is going to play out. Our view in terms of what we have built into our model for 2010 is a normal seasonal year off of a very good Q4. So in general when you extrapolate that out and do the math it gets you to double digit growth year-over-year because of the high peak in Q4 and the trough you had in the first half of 2009. We are building into our number set a modest recovery of corporate purchases of PCs. That is we are not building in anything extraordinary out of that. Just sort of normal return to deployment as the evaluation cycles for the new hardware and Windows 7 gets completed. 
What we are benefiting from in the second half of the year and I think we will continue to benefit from throughout this year is the extraordinary return on investment that is incurred by deploying new server technologies. The last technology was sort of a 9 to 1 ROI kind of technology. As we deploy the new Xeon products out it is 15 and 20 to 1. So we think that is compelling. The power conservation associated with that is compelling and it is one of the things that gives us optimism independent of PC refresh in the enterprise for 2010. 
Stacy Smith 

The other part of your question was gross margin seasonality. I would say it is a typical year from that perspective. We put out the forecast for Q1. 61% is the midpoint of that forecast range. Typically we would see a second quarter from a unit standpoint is going to be seasonally down. That means that typically the second quarter gross margin is going to be a bit below that 61% and then when we get into the second half of the year my expectation is it is above that 61% and that is how we get to 61% on average for the year.

The next question comes from the line of  Doug Freedman – Broadpoint.

Doug Freedman - Broadpoint
If we look at your business model and all of the effort being placed on new growth streams of revenue can you talk about the impact you expect that to have on the longer term operating model and especially on the operating income line? 
Stacy Smith 

I am going to go through that in quite a bit more detail in the upcoming May investor meeting so I think I will save the longer answer for that. I will just say our expectation is based on our performance leadership, software compatibility and the value proposition around i8 we can grow those businesses with a very healthy product margin, not dilute the overall gross margins of the company…we are on record as saying that, and I think if you look at the two businesses that are significant size today they are consistent with that belief. Our embedded business is a $1 billion plus business. It is running at product margins that are a little bit ahead of what the rest of our core business is. Atom and Netbooks we have grown that to now be a $1.4 billion force in 2009 also at a product margin that is right in there with the rest of the core business. So that is our expectation and we will talk more at the investor meeting.

The next question comes from the line of Adam Benjamin – Jefferies. 
Adam Benjamin – Jefferies 
Just a question on price elasticity. Obviously in 2009 the end market pricing for PCs came down pretty dramatically, roughly 20-30% in some instances. I am just curious as you plan for 2010 how you are thinking about that driving the elasticity of unit growth that we saw in 2009 and how it could potentially impact pricing plus or minus. 
Paul Otellini 

2009 was a funny year as we all went through and know. The first half of the year the lights had gone off. What we saw over the course of the year was growth particularly in notebooks and netbooks around consumer purchases. This was not a robust year for corporate purchases. That alone, that mix shift alone to consumer and away from corporate was part of the reasons you saw PC prices on average dropping faster than you would have ordinarily seen. That is point one. 
Point two is there really wasn’t a new refresh cycle in terms of hardware last year. We had versions of our core product line out there but they were extensions of the existing technology. There was nothing really to drive sell up. The new core products we have just introduced particularly the i5 and i7 have great new technology in terms of the wireless display technology and turbo which gives you the performance boost when you need it and power savings when you don’t. I think the early excitement on those two product lines gives us some cause for optimism even in consumer space for an improved sell up cycle. 
Adam Benjamin – Jefferies 

So it is fair to say as you are planning for 2010 you are thinking those two dynamics; one a mix shift back to the enterprise and one with new products can drive end market pricing back up and should help you drive your ASPs up as well? 
Paul Otellini 

No, I didn’t quite get there. Those were mature market comments. On top of that I think there will be continued growth like there has been over the last 3-4 years in emerging markets where the emerging markets outpace the mature ones. Clearly in emerging markets the average selling price of computers is lower than it is in New York City. 
Stacy Smith 

I think it is important to separate the mix within the segment of the market from the overall mix of our sales. We are refreshing products likely to have a nice benefit from that inside of each of the segments but the driver over the last 4-5 years has been emerging markets growing faster than mature markets, consumer growing faster than the rest of the market and there is good price elasticity there. It benefits us to bring the price down and sell our technology into those segments.

The next question comes from the line of Manish Goyle - C.R.E.F.
Manish Goyle - C.R.E.F.
My question is on operating expenses. You showed good discipline in the quarterly results of 2009 and when I look at your first quarter guidance of $3 billion for $9.7 billion of revenue I am a little bit surprised because it is roughly the same revenue number you had in the first quarter of 2008 yet your operating expenses are $200 million lower. So I just wonder what changed and why you are not seeing better leverage? 
Stacy Smith 

Let me take a shot at that. First off let me go back to the commitment that Paul and I have made historically. We are still absolutely on the path that over time we are bringing down spending as a percent of revenue. I think we have had some good results in the last couple of quarters and our goal over time is we are going to continue to do that. 
When we look at 2010 we kind of think of our spending in a couple of different ways. First off, we are making some investments in R&D projects this year. We have had five years in a row of year-over-year employment decline. We will actually grow employment a little bit in 2010. So you haven’t seen that from us in a long time. We have some high return on investment projects where we are going to go and make some incremental investments. 
Secondly, there are a series of things that aren’t really related to the employment level that are going to impact the spending level in 2010. One is the categorization of how we categorize process engineering from year to year. Remember last year it was cost of sales. This year it is R&D. So that shift happens in kind of a digital fashion and that impacts the quarter-to-quarter walk you are doing. We are giving raises. We have revenue dependent initiatives that are going to be higher than last year. So the combination of those two things is really what you are seeing on the spending line. Neither of those changes the commitment that we are getting great results through our focus on efficiency and we plan to continue to bring that down over time. 
Manish Goyle - C.R.E.F.
For full year if I look at your first quarter guidance of $3 billion and full year guidance of $11.8 billion are you suggesting that even if you continue to hire your operating expenses will remain roughly flat quarterly or is there any other way to think about this? 
Stacy Smith 

I am not making a specific forecast for any quarter in the year and I am not making a specific forecast for 2010. We have articulated a goal as a longer term goal of bringing down spending as a percent of revenue. We have made good progress on that and we are going to continue to drive it over a longer term horizon. 
Operator

The next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon – Sanford Bernstein. 
Stacy Rasgon – Sanford Bernstein 
I would like to follow-up on that OpEx question from Manish. If I look at the OpEx this quarter guidance are down a little bit but it is still around $3 billion and you have total OpEx for the year pretty close to 12 which would imply flat OpEx on an average basis going forward. This is a case now where you potentially have like you said OpEx moving from cost of goods back into R&D. You are building out new businesses that you are not in right now in the mobile space and what not. I am just wondering, if you can walk us a little bit more through some of your assumptions around the OpEx growth going forward and that number that makes up the guidance for 2010? 
Paul Otellini 

So I am answering the right question, is your question on why is it so flat over the course of the year? 
Stacy Rasgon – Sanford Bernstein 
I am actually wondering why it is not up a little bit more than it is given you have these other drivers. With the process development moving back into R&D and with new businesses you are ramping from relatively nascent amounts today I am just wondering why the OpEx growth wouldn’t be expected to be actually higher than kind of the flat level that seems to be implied off of the Q1 guidance? 
Stacy Smith 

The OpEx growth when you kind of think about it over the course of the year there are a couple of those elements that just get spread quarter-to-quarter. So the categorization of the research and development happened digitally. I failed to mention we are also picking up Wind River in 2010. That was an acquisition that we did in the back half of last year so that is kind of spread across every quarter. We do the same with the profit and revenue dependent spending. So it is probably a little flatter than you would expect. 
The increase in R&D projects in the scheme of things doesn’t move the number that much. As we have been, we are finding efficiencies in other places that offset some of that. So when you kind of take all that alchemy together you end up with a number that is kind of flattish quarter by quarter by quarter. 
Stacy Rasgon – Sanford Bernstein 
And you don’t need to build any more SG&A to start selling more into the mobile space, for example, with the new Atom application? 
Stacy Smith 

No our finance group is so efficient we can sell a lot more than we are today. They are efficient as well as Paul points out. 
Operator

The next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung – Citigroup. 

Glen Yeung - Citigroup
Can you quantify how much ASPs were up in Q4 and how much you expect them to be down? What is normal ASP decline for a year? 
Stacy Smith 

I can do it at some level of precision because all of those hit the gross margin reconciliation. So if we start with Q4 and you kind of think about the gross margin in Q4 and the increase we saw, the ASP accounted for about two points of that increase. When we think about the course of 2010 I am showing the 2010 gross margin reconciliation versus 2009 that I think the decline in ASP is worth about 2-3 points and I would say that order of magnitude is pretty normal. Q1 will be a small step on the way I think in the gross margin recon over time you will see that is about half a point down in the first quarter. 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
If you say it was worth two points in a quarter of gross margin does that imply the average ASP was down 2%? 
Stacy Smith 

Up. 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
Up. The same magnitude of how we should read that? 
Paul Otellini 

We all struggle to say we are up and we don’t see that all that often because of the phenomenon we said. I think you can work through the gross margin math on that. You will come up with something a little different than 2-3% but the gross margin was up. 
Operator

The next question comes from the line of John Pitzer - Credit Suisse. 
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
I want to revisit the mix question for this year. With your guidance of 2010 we will see normal ASP degradation. You kind of have some tailwinds that should be helping you. Consumer moves to corporate. You have the server cycle. You could make the argument that you will have a more robust [inaudible] product line this year and you have the introduction of [inaudible]. I am kind of struggling with why this wouldn’t be a better than average selling price year. Is this sort of an implication that Atom reaccelerates as a percent of the mix or can you help me reconcile what I see as more tailwinds than headwinds on ASP? 
Stacy Smith 

I will try and give you some color on that. I’m not sure I can fill in all the holes. We are all guessing. No one knows for sure. As I said earlier we are not programming into our guidance or our estimates any kind of overnight recovery of the corporate market. I think for a variety of reasons that will start coming back but it will come back based upon eval cycles, qualification cycles and IT shops and then as corporate budgets open up they have to decide whether they want to first buy PCs or servers. I think in terms of IT equipment. We really haven’t seen enough so far except for the server run up in the second half to be confident on when and what the rate of corporate PC refresh would be. Although we have built some into this number. 
Two, in terms of Atom we have now been at this for 18 months or a little more than that. Up to this point in time with all that data we have not seen any meaningful cannibalization of the notebook market by netbooks. Netbooks look to be 90% of them are clearly additive and they are clearly going into market segments that were unaddressed prior to this. In the first 18 months of the netbooks most people who bought them were buying them as incremental machines or travel companions. Principally in mature markets or tier one cities of emerging markets. I think in 2010 you will start seeing that phenomenon moving into emerging markets. As that does there may be a slightly higher mix of that but it certainly wouldn’t be cannibalistic to our notebook business. 
So we are kind of playing all these together in a stew and saying this is how we see the year coming out.

The next question comes from the line of Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Merrill Lynch. 
Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Merrill Lynch 
On the 32 nm product or the new architecture products that really helped your selling prices in the fourth quarter I guess was that the primary driver for ASPs [within the] that given the volumes were not very large or did your older 45 nm generation product also help the ASP? Did you sell a much higher mix within the 45 nm products? 
Stacy Smith 

Within the client group it was I would say a mix of both but the 32 nm effect was pretty pronounced. As Paul said in his prepared remarks we brought out dozens of new products across the client on 32 nm. The way we plan our manufacturing is we kind of started the manufacturing at the highest end first and worked our way down and we are still working our way down into the mainstream and value price points. So that was a pretty pronounced impact in terms of the mix we sold in Q4. 
Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Merrill Lynch 
Despite the fact this wasn’t a big volume component of what you sold within the client business? 
Stacy Smith 

It was a not insignificant component of what we sold. We ramped these factors pretty fast. You can see it in our inventory results and in our sales mix. Or I can see it in our sales mix. We don’t show it to you.

James Covello - Goldman Sachs
Could you give us some estimate with what you are going to do in factory loadings in Q1 and Q2? 
Paul Otellini 

Probably not at the level of granularity you are hoping for but I will give you a sense. Another one in May we are pretty specific and we will show you kind of quarter by quarter utilization as well as the forecast going into the future. We are in the sweet spot of loading. We are running nicely full. We have the ability to respond to some upside. We always want to have some of that but we are full to the point we are getting really good cost results. I would expect that to be the norm for this year.

The next question comes from the line of Graham Tanaka – Tanaka Capital Management. 
Graham Tanaka – Tanaka Capital Management 
A little more on the 32 nm ramp. Pretty fast can I get a feel for what proportion of sales might have been 32 and more importantly what that might be by the end of the year. It seems to be that is probably one of the more important reasons for the bulk of sales ASPs going up in the margin is the 32 ramp being faster than expected and higher utilization? 
Paul Otellini 

I wouldn’t say it is faster than expected. We expected it to be pretty fast. Beyond that I will punt on that one as well and we will show you that data in May when we have the investor meeting.

The next question comes from the line of Craig Berger - FBR Capital Markets. 
Craig Berger - FBR Capital Markets 
Can you explain why the first quarter gross margin guidance is 61% and then the year is also only 61% and any other color around that? 
Stacy Smith 

I would be happy to. I will apologize in advance because I think to explain Q1 I have to explain Q4 and to explain the year I have to kind of have to go through a lot. So if you will bear with me I will do that. 
Q4 came in several of the elements as we expected. We did see good news associated with the qualification for sale of the 32 nm products as well as sell through of some of the previously reserved material there. That was about 2.5 points of the increase we saw in Q4. We got the good news we were expecting in CPU volumes. They were seasonally up in the quarter. We got the good news we were expecting in lower excess capacity. In fact our excess capacity charges have now gone to zero for the quarter which we haven’t been there since the end of last year. 
The places where it was a little unexpected was the bump we saw in CPU ASPs. That was a couple of points of good news I wasn’t expecting when I first set the forecast. I was a little better in terms of unit cost than I expected. Not a lot but a little. 
Then you move into Q1. The drivers that take us from 64% down to 61%, first 65%...it is hard for me to even say that as an all time record. 65% down to 61%. The first is we are going to see some higher CPU costs. This is very consistent with what I showed you at the investor meeting last May. Those first wafers coming off of 32 nm as we are loading the factories tend to be pretty expensive. That is what ended up in inventory. That is what ships out in Q1. That is going to drive a little bit of a cost increase and then we kind of come down as we go through the year. So very consistent with what I showed you there. It is a seasonally down quarter from Q4 so we get a little bit of downward pressure as a result of lower CPU sales volumes. 
I do expect in Q1 my mix was a little less rich than what I sold in Q4. That is about half a point. So that is how you get to the 61%. I will pause there and see if that makes sense and then I will take you through the year so I don’t get too far ahead of you. 
Craig Berger - FBR Capital Markets 
It does. 
Stacy Smith 

In a previous question I kind of gave what I expected to be the shape of the year. We start at 61%. Q2 tends to be seasonally down but so I expect that to be down from 61%. Then if you do the math you would say we are forecasting a second half gross margin that is something above 61% in the low 60’s. I think the debate you and I will have why is that in the low 60’s versus the mid 60’s and it really comes back to the conversation we have been having on ASP. A lot of things go right to get us into that low 60’s. We have got unit costs coming down, a relatively benign period in terms of other costs of sales so we don’t have significant start up costs or excess capacity charges or anything like that. 
Paul articulated we are anticipating robust unit growth. That keeps the factories pretty full but we are anticipating that pricing comes down some from where we are today. That brings us down a couple or few points over the course of the year.

A follow-up to that question on gross margin. What could make your 61% assumption for the year conservative? What are some of your assumptions that might be able to upside there just to understand the level here? 
Stacy Smith 

Great question. First of all we have to put that 61% into perspective. 61% is a great gross margin. It says a lot of things are going right for us so I don’t want to jinx this by talking about what has to go from a great gross margin to a perfect gross margin if you will. The forecast is assuming declining unit costs. It is assuming we are in kind of a benign cycle in terms of startup costs and other costs of sales. It is assuming good volume and all of that is baked in. We also see just continued great performance out of the factory network from a productivity and an efficiency standpoint and that helps our costs. If you wanted a scenario that would take us higher than that it would be a flattening out of the ASP curve or a richer mix or more units than what we have baked in and likewise I could come up with a list that takes me into the lower end of the range where we have a less rich mix or unit growth isn’t as robust as we thought and our factories aren’t as full.

The next question comes from the line of Gus Pritchard - Piper Jaffray. 
Gus Pritchard - Piper Jaffray
Real quickly I am curious if you can talk a little bit about the carrier as a channel and as you are thinking about upside for the year maybe that will play a factor? Do you feel comfortable you are going to have enough capacity? 
Paul Otellini 

The carrier channel has been around for awhile in notebooks. It is good but it is not explosive. What we saw in netbooks in the fourth quarter or the last 3-4 months of the year was carriers became a very significant portion of the volume of netbooks. Probably in a range of 25%. What led me to my comments earlier about netbook growth in emerging markets was really based upon our view that the carrier model will be very efficient in those markets because it is low entry price, subsidized model just like cell phones are and you get the PC and the bandwidth at the same time. 
I think that is likely to be a good piece of the netbook business. A growing piece of the netbook business over the course of 2010. In terms of upside, we have built pretty significant growth to that into the number set already so I don’t know there will be much upside there. 
Secondly, in terms of capacity I don’t see any issues on the horizon. We are planning for a very high end robust growth from a capacity standpoint in terms of the wafer starts we need to put in place and even then we have time to make some incremental decisions for the fourth quarter 2010 kind of volumes over the course of this year. So we will watch the first half of the year and then make the calls. Right now we believe we have enough buffer capacity coming on particularly in the 32 nm ramp and we have the older 45 nm line still intact to be able to handle virtually anything I can imagine being thrown at us.

The next question comes from the line of Brendan Furlong - Miller Tabak. 
Brendan Furlong - Miller Tabak
A question on the embedded/other Intel architecture. If you could give some color on what your expectations are for 2010. You mentioned 600 design wins. What is your expectation from time of design win to revenue with all those new design wins? 
Paul Otellini 

Let me speak to design wins and Stacy will tell you what he thinks of being better and a direction on that. Typically there is no such thing as an average design win in embedded. Typically it is sort of a year to 18 months from initial conversation to production. Along the way in that initial conversation you end up closing the design maybe 1/3 of the way through that. A lot of these units tend to run for multiple years. In some cases 10 years. Our embedded business has grown at double digit percent for the last three years. It will continue to I think out grow the company in terms of revenue but I am not going to give you a precise number. 
Stacy Smith 

Does that answer your question or did you have another question about other Intel architecture segment? I wasn’t sure. 
Brendan Furlong - Miller Tabak
No. That pretty much answers my question. 
Operator

The next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann – Raymond James.  
Hans Mosesmann – Raymond James 
A question about the transition of Westmere as it replaces [Penron]. How quickly can we see the cross over there in terms of units and if you could also explain with regard to Pine Trail over the existing Atom? 
Paul Otellini 

I think on the first part of the question Stacy already answered that we are not in a position to show you that number today and we will show you in gruesome detail at the analyst meeting in a couple of months. 
What we are doing with this cycle in general is using the technology to move 32 nm into the mainstream more quickly than we did with 45. The rate of crossover between 32 and 45 will be more a function of second half demand in total than capacity planning to cut one off versus the other. If demand is red hot the transition will be slower even though we will ramp 32 as fast as possible and if it less red hot it will be slower. In terms of Pine Trail I think we will move pretty quickly to transition that.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Q3 2009 Intel Corporation earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host, Mr. Kevin Sellers, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir. 
R. Kevin Sellers
Thank you and welcome everyone to Intel's third quarter 2009 earnings conference call. I am joined today by our Chief Executive Officer, Paul Otellini, and Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith. 
Our earnings release and updated financial statements were released today at approximately 1:15 Pacific Daylight time and can be found on our investor website, intc.com. 
This quarter we introduced a change to our earnings process by posting earlier today to our investor website additional management commentary and context about our quarterly results. This was done in an effort to create better understanding of the results prior to the call, something we felt would improve the interactive dialog with management during this meeting. We hope this change is helpful and as always would love to hear your feedback so we can continue to try and improve our disclosure practices. 
As we begin our call, let me remind everyone that today’s discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. 
If during our call today there are any non-GAAP financial references made, we will post the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliations on our investor website. So with that, let me hand it over to Paul for some comments followed by brief remarks from Stacy. Paul. 
Paul S. Otellini
Thanks, Kevin. We are very pleased with the company’s third quarter. The strong financial performance is a result of having the right products at the right cost at the right time for a recovering global economy. The strength in our business remains primarily consumer driven with broad-based demand across all geographies. Our mobile business had a particularly strong quarter -- in fact, we saw the sequential unit growth rate of notebook processors and chipsets actually exceed the growth rate of Atom processors and chipsets. While Atom and netbooks are important growth drivers for us, our traditional notebook business remains one of the primary drivers of revenue growth and we expect that to continue in the future. 
In the server segment, we are pleased with the acceptance of Nehalem in the enterprise. While overall enterprise spending remains weak, the compelling value proposition of Nehalem is generating growth opportunities even in a down economy and will be a strong profit driver for Intel in the coming quarters. 
On a regional basis, China had a particularly strong quarter and continued to show strength during the just completed Golden Week. The U.S. continued to ride strong consumer sales with the back-to-school cycle exceeding our expectations. Sequentially, Japan showed very healthy growth and Europe growth was slightly above seasonal trends. 
I know that many of you listening today are concerned about inventory levels and the state of sell-through around the world. Let me share just a couple of important data points. 
First, our channel sales out have shown healthy sequential growth for three quarters in a row, with channel sales out this quarter actually exceeding the activity we saw in Q3 of 2008. 
Inventory in the channel remains slightly below normal levels, reflecting both good sell-through as well as disciplined inventory management. 
At our large OEM customers, component inventories are roughly half the peak level of late last year and have been approximately flat throughout 2009. Much of this is due to our implementation of inventory hubs, where we hold the inventory for our large OEM customers who then pull inventory only as needed. This helps our customers better manage their inventory levels while giving us increased visibility into real-time system production levels. 
We watched supply chain inventory very carefully and believe the pipeline has been appropriately rebuilt to support increased end demand and yet remains well below the peak we saw at the end of 2008. 
I also want to highlight the excellent performance of our factory network. Our internal inventories continue to run quite lean, with factory throughput improvements providing us with the ability to respond to demand changes far more quickly and effectively than ever before. 
Our product cost declines are significant and are a reflection of improved loadings, better equipment re-use, and exceptional yields. All of this leads to better-than-expected costs across our newer technologies, allowing us to expand margins in a difficult economic environment. 
In closing, let me briefly mention the biggest drive of our product differentiation in the marketplace and that is our process technology leadership. At our IDF event last month in San Francisco, I shared that we had shipped over 200 million 45-nanometer processors to date. I am very pleased to note that this quarter, we begin volume production of our newest process technology at 32-nanometers. Our 32-nanometer process is stunning technology that incorporates second generation of high [K] metal gate transistors. As we ramp this new technology, we will be refreshing our entire product line, providing better performance, lower costs, and lower power consumption for all of our platforms. Importantly, 32-nanometer process technology also allows us to accelerate system on-chip implementation to the Intel architecture, providing Intel with new growth opportunities in the coming years. 
With that, let me turn it over to Stacy for a few brief remarks. 
Stacy J. Smith
Thanks, Paul. The combination of strong execution and a strengthening market led to exceptional financial results. Better-than-expected demand in the microprocessor and chipset businesses led to the largest sequential third quarter revenue growth in over 30 years. Gross margin percent at 58% was up nearly seven points from the second quarter. Operating profit was up 80% and net income was up 77%, excluding the impact of the $1.45 billion EC fine taken in the second quarter. 
The PC market segment is recovering nicely, with our microprocessor revenue excluding Atom growing 23% since the market bottomed in the first quarter. In the same time period, Atom microprocessors and associated chipsets have grown to $450 million in revenue in the third quarter and $1 billion year-to-date. 
Gross margin benefited from exceptional execution in the third quarter. We responded to our customers’ up-side request and achieved a significant reduction in costs, resulting in a 58% gross margin, a nearly seven point increase from the third quarter. 
As a result of capital re-use and achieving efficiencies, our capital forecast of $4.5 billion is now less than the annual depreciation run-rate. Operating expenses are in tight control. This is most clearly seen in spending as a percent of revenue. In the third quarter, spending for R&D and MG&A as a percent of revenue improved 2.5 percentage points to 29%. We achieved this result inclusive of the [bi-annual] shifts of process engineers moving from cost of sales to R&D. 
The number of employees increased less than 300 people in the third quarter, including the completion of the Wind River acquisition. 
Our business model is generating both profits and cash. Third quarter operating profit was $2.6 billion, up 80% from $1.4 billion excluding the EC fine, and as a percent of revenue grew 9.6 points to 27%. Total cash investments comprised of cash, short-term investments, and debt security trading assets, ended the quarter at $12.9 billion, $1.6 billion higher than the second quarter. Cash flow from operations was approximately $4 billion. 
During the quarter, we paid the EC fine, purchased Wind River, bought back $1.7 billion in stock, paid nearly $800 million in dividends, and purchased $944 million in capital assets. Additionally, we issued $2 billion of convertible debt. 
For the fourth quarter, we are forecasting a seasonal increase in revenue, taking the midpoint of our forecast range to $10.1 billion, a 23% increase from the fourth quarter of 2008. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range to increase another 4.5 points to 62%. 
The third quarter results and the forecast for the fourth quarter show the superior financial results that can be generated by the combination of a recovering market, strong execution, and a leadership product portfolio that serves markets spanning from servers to notebooks to netbooks. The factories are executing superbly and we are showing good financial discipline. These attributes are leading to the financial results we are seeing today and they serve as a strong foundation from which we can build in the future. 
With that, let me turn it back to Kevin. 
R. Kevin Sellers
Okay, thanks, Stacy and Paul. We’ll now be happy to take your questions. In another slight change to our process, we’d like to limit each questioner to one question only, which will allow for more people that would like to ask a question the opportunity to do so. [Chanel], we’re now ready for our first questioner. 
Question-and-Answer Session

Operator
Your first question is from the line of Uche Orgi with UBS. 
Uche Orji - UBS
Thank you very much. Let me just ask about inventories -- I mean, there’s been a lot of talk, Paul, about double ordering into China -- let me just ask you, your in-house inventory right now is well below historical levels. Is this the new normal, given reduced cycle times? Or should we expect to rebuild through the rest of Q4 into first half of 2010? And related to that, can you just also talk about what you are seeing in terms of corporate spending -- was there any little bit of corporate spending embedded in the Q4 guidance or should we expect more from corporate in 2010?
R. Kevin Sellers
We’re going to pick the first question, kind of keep it to one question, if we could, so we’ll do the first one. 
Uche Orji - UBS
I had to try. 
R. Kevin Sellers
I got it -- we love your effort. 

Stacy J. Smith
It was a run-on sentence approach to one question, I got it. Let me take -- the internal inventory question, let me take it and I am sure Paul will get other questions on channel inventory as well as we go forward here. From an internal inventory standpoint, we’re lower than I like right now. We want to get some inventory in place in Q4. Part of that is we’re just running a little leaner. We were surprised by some of the unit upsides we saw over the course of the third quarter and we want to replenish and we are also, as we are on the cusp of the transition to 32-nanometer, if you look historically at the time where we put a little bit more inventory in place to just buffer both sides of the demand/supply equation, so I plan to grow inventories a bit in the fourth quarter. 
Uche Orji - UBS
Thank you. 
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Sumit Dhanda with Banc of America.
Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Merrill Lynch
Stacy, a question for you on the fourth quarter gross margin outlook -- obviously very strong. My only question was you have indicated in your transcript that there’s a point from higher CPU volumes in terms of a benefit. I guess my question was is mix assumed flat, and then along the same lines, given that your excess capacity charges are dropping off and your fab loadings are increasing as you build inventory, why not a higher bump just from volumes into Q4?
Stacy J. Smith
On the first question of mix, we’ll likely see a slightly richer mix of CPU shipments in the fourth quarter than we do in the third quarter. Remember the way the supply chain works and we think the supply chain is looking pretty normal right now, if they put some chipset inventory in place in the third quarter and then they couple it with a CPU in the fourth quarter, so probably a little richer mix to CPUs in the fourth. That, coupled with just an increase in volume, is about a point of the gross margin. 
To your excess capacity question, the answer is we’ll be out of excess capacity charges by the end of the fourth quarter so we’ve kind of took some significant charges in -- end of Q4, Q1. We saw some improvement in Q2 and Q3 with the further improvement that we are forecasting for Q4. You know, those will be zero, in essence, as we leave the quarter. 
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Craig Berger with FBR Capital Markets.
Craig Berger - FBR Capital Markets 
Congratulations on the strong results and kudos on the conference call process improvement. I guess on the gross margin, can you help us understand where capacity utilizations are at and what kind of capacity you have for 2010 growth? And then also as part of that, if you look at the last time your revenues were about at this level -- 
R. Kevin Sellers
Craig? I think we lost Craig. Chanel, are you still there?
Operator
Yes, sir. 
Craig Berger - FBR Capital Markets 
-- why that’s happened?
R. Kevin Sellers
We lost you, Craig. We got the first part of your question but you went out for a minute and you’ll have to restate that. 
Craig Berger - FBR Capital Markets 
So utilizations and then the last time you guys were at $10.1 billion in Q308, your gross margins were about three to four points lower. Can you talk about some of the structural improvements that have happened over the last year?
Stacy J. Smith
To your utilization question, I showed a chart at the investor meeting that showed my expectations for the year. We are a little ahead of that so in Q4 from a factory utilization standpoint, we are right in what I would call the optimal range. We’ve articulated we’re kind of between 80% and 90%, gives us the ability to achieve really good cost and also have some capability to deal with upsides on specific products, so that’s where we are at. 
And then to your gross margin question, it’s really the work we’ve been doing over the last three years. We’re in a situation where we are able to re-use a significant amount of capacity from 45 to 32 -- that’s going to be helpful to us. You can see that in our CapEx line. You can see our costs coming down, our throughput times are coming down, our output per piece of equipment is going up, our yields are going up, so it’s just a variety of work there that’s leading to really good performance from the factory network that is helping us on the gross margin line. 
Paul S. Otellini
I think the other part of Craig’s question was 2010 capacities, and let me just try that -- the significant increase in our capacity going into next year, Craig, is to continue to ramp the 32-nanometer factories. We’ve got two factories sort of ramping now against a planned four. That remains on track. That technology will provide the significant new product portfolio and capacity expansion we think we need for the 2010 environment.
Craig Berger - FBR Capital Markets 
Thank you so much. 
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Daniel Berenbaum with Auriga USA.
Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga USA
You guys have done a great job managing OpEx and maybe along the lines of the last question, when you look at the last time, if you look at Q4 guidance the midpoint last time you were at that revenue level, you were around the same OpEx level as you guided to and that’s with the shift of start-up costs into the R&D line. So as you look forward into 2010, assuming you continue to see some of the strength, do you need to add anything back to the R&D or SG&A lines, or do the cuts continue as we roll into 2010? Is there more money to take out of those lines?
Stacy J. Smith
I am not going to provide a point forecast for 2010. Let me though answer a couple of things we’ve told you before I want to just reinforce -- first off, we do believe that through our work on efficiency, we can continue to improve spending as a percent of revenue. And so that’s an area where Paul and I continue to be very focused. We believe that there’s potential benefit there as revenue grows where we can bank some of those efficiencies. 
It’s different from a are we going to be smaller next year -- I would say we are through the cutting phase of our efficiency effort and now we are hopefully in the growth phase of that efficiency effort. 
And I think that was it -- yeah. 
Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga USA
That’s great, thanks. 
Operator
Your next question is from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations. Paul, in your opening comments you talked about Nehalem being a profit driver over the next couple of quarters. You know, there’s been a lot of conversations about the PC upgrade cycle in the corporate market. Can you help me understand how you guys are looking at sort of the potential for server replacement cycle? And I guess with the EX coming out, help me understand to what extent that helps you grow market share and/or go after some of the proprietary solutions that X86 has not addressed and what could happen to TAM there as you do that?
Paul S. Otellini
Okay. Well, the Nehalem product line, you’re right, John, it is now ramping through the bulk of our products. We’ve launched the high-end desktop, mid-range desktop, and you’ll start seeing -- and notebook and now you’ll start seeing more volume start shipping this quarter in addition to the -- in anticipation of a January launch, so we’ll have a full fledged client portfolio and the MP servers all shipping by year-end around Nehalem. 
In terms of a server upgrade cycle, what we are seeing on the Nehalem DP is that it’s not so much an upgrade cycle that is driving the volume right now -- it’s economics of the data center. People are looking at swapping out eight to nine older generation servers for a single Nehalem server on a ratio basis, as it has the same performance -- same or better performance, much better power consumption so it lowers their electricity bill and gives them a little bit more flexibility in their data center footprint. 
I think that’s just going to accelerate as NP starts shipping because you have those same dynamics applying in there against an older generation of machines. I do think that -- if there is opportunity with the NP machines to start encroaching on what has traditionally been the risk portion of the market or even some of the low-end of the mainframe portion of the market with this product line, as you look at some of the very high-end machines our customers are working on that are well above [eight-way] machines. 
The bad news about that is that that part of the market is very small in units, so when I look at the overall TAM expansion, there’s good margin there, there’s good numbers but it’s not anywhere near what we would get by say replacing the existing Xeon machines, both NP and DP, in the existing data frame, good data center configurations. 
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
Great, thanks, guys.
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Glen Yeung with Citi.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
Paul, maybe just your insight here -- to the extent that Intel is growing above the industry growth rate, to what extent do you think that’s attributable to one, share gain; two, market creation from Atom; and three, any pent-up demand that you may be seeing for Nehalem?
Paul S. Otellini
Which industry are you referring to?
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
Well, PCs. 
Paul S. Otellini
I don’t think that we can grow much above the PC growth rate at the end of the day. I mean, there is -- there has been some share gain over the course of this year. We’ll see what this quarter maps out to but I would think that trend could continue this quarter. But at the end of the day, we need the volume. The PC market has to grow.
Our current view of the PC market, as I said at IDF, is that the volume year-on-year, ’09 versus ’08, will be flat to up slightly, which is a significant change from the industry’s views six months ago. And I think you are seeing inside of that Intel do well because of the shift to notebooks where we enjoy a higher market segment share than we do in desktops. 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
Okay, thanks. 
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Chris Danely with J.P. Morgan.
Chris Danely - J.P. Morgan
You said you wanted to grow your inventory a little bit in Q4 -- can you give us a sense of if there was any sort of target you have in mind? And then what would be the thoughts on Q1, assuming some sort of normal seasonal quarter? Would you look to take inventory up, down, or keep it flat in Q1?
Stacy J. Smith
I am not going to put a forecast out there for Q1. I’d like to grow inventory modestly this quarter, and keep in mind we are also going to have the phenomenon that you can see into the gross margin line where we will, as we qualify the first products on 32-nanometer for sale, we will value that inventory so that was stuff that was written off in the third quarter and then we’ll value the material in line in the fourth quarter. So that’s a piece of it. 
But I’d expect to put modest amount of inventory in place in the fourth quarter, just to build the inventory level back up and to make sure I have the right mix of products as I go through the product transitions. 
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Gus Pritchard with Piper Jaffray.
Gus Pritchard - Piper Jaffray
Thanks for taking my question. A real short one -- what is -- what was the sale of Atom related products and that was it. 
Stacy J. Smith
In the quarter, so Atom and the associated chipsets were a bit above $400 million -- I think it was $415 million is the exact number. And year-to-date, we’ve sold over -- or right at $1 billion worth of Atom and associated chipsets. 
R. Kevin Sellers
Is that what you needed, Gus?
Gus Pritchard - Piper Jaffray
Can I ask another one?
R. Kevin Sellers
Sure, a follow-up, go ahead. 
Gus Pritchard - Piper Jaffray
Just real quick, on Win 7, I mean, it’s obviously a significant product launch for Microsoft. Has that had any perturbation at all in the supply chain and how are you guys seeing that? 
Paul S. Otellini
Not that we’ve seen. I think there’s a lot of excitement about Win 7 but again, the trend we saw for the bulk of this year, including the current quarter, third quarter, was driven by consumer sales, particularly in notebooks and netbooks. If you go into retail now, you are seeing that OEMs and retail channels are offering coupons for machines -- for an upgrade, a free upgrade to Win 7 when it comes out, which has been done by Microsoft in prior generations, so that tends to reduce any wait for the launch kind of anticipation for people that really want it and get the upgrade that way in a seamless no-cost basis. 
The corporate side is a bit different. Corporate needs to do a qualification in their environment and that process has begun on a worldwide basis. We see a lot of interest in corporations around Win 7 and the new Nehalem based SKUs, which are sort of made for each other in terms of the performance and power management and security characteristics of the products that go together there. 
I would expect that that evaluation process will happen over the rest of this year and we’ll start seeing corporate purchases on a refresh basis begin in 2010. 
Gus Pritchard - Piper Jaffray
Great. Thank you. 
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Doug Freedman with Broadpoint.
Doug Freedman - Broadpoint
Thanks, guys, for taking my question. Paul, you’ve been spending a lot of effort on growing sort of non-core revenues. You’ve got a whole bunch of pieces you’ve assembled now -- is there any sort of guidance you’d like to offer us on how much impact that could have to incremental revs in 2010?
Paul S. Otellini
In 2010? No, I won't give you a lot of guidance. I can't give you a lot of guidance there and -- well, except to point out the trends that we did in the analyst meeting, Doug, which is that of those four businesses that we’ve really aimed at with the Atom system on chip products, the one that is shipping in high volume today is the embedded business and that’s converting to Atom and growing around that and that is a business which is well north of $1 billion and on a very nice growth rate. So that’s the one you’ll see the revenue appear first in in terms of measurable amounts. The consumer electronics and ultra mobile activities are proceeding nicely in terms of design wins and product development but the volume there is really out in time a bit. 
Stacy J. Smith
If I can add to that, if you just look at the clip we’re on with Atom where we are seeing nice growth, Atom in netbooks, you know, exiting this year that’s in a clip that it should be a pretty significant growth driver for us next year. 
Paul S. Otellini
Even next year, yeah. 
Doug Freedman - Broadpoint
Thank you. 
Operator
Your next question is from the line of John Barton with Cowen & Company.
John Barton - Cowen & Company
Thank you very much. Paul, could you provide us an update on how you are thinking about the NAND Flash business? It’s been a little while since we’ve really focused on that because prices have stabilized headed the right direction -- what are you thinking about the importance of Intel? Are solid states drives something that is going to drive processor growth and you want to be there to enable it? Those types of thoughts, please. 
Paul S. Otellini
You’re right -- the job one for the NAND group is to drive themselves towards profitability and they’ve done a very good job this year in albeit a rising market for NAND in doing that but the losses continue to get reduced substantially and they are on a path towards I think a sustainable business here. 
At the end of the day, that’s the ultimate test for this business. We love the fact that it has a strategic nature but it must make profits for us. 
We are increasing the amount of our NAND that goes into solid state drives, both at the enterprise and client level, and we think that is important for our platforms and we think we have pretty good value there in terms of the technology, both the quality of the parts and the algorithms that we use around the drives. So that allows us to get a slightly better than commodity margin on most of the NAND business. 
And we’ve got a couple of other platform ideas that you will see unfolding from us over the next couple of years using this technology. 
John Barton - Cowen & Company
Thank you. 
Operator
Your next question is from the line of  Manish [Goyle with C.R.E.F.].
Manish Goyle - C.R.E.F.
Thank you. I was wondering if you can give some view on PC unit growth for 2010 in light of the corporate refresh -- potential for corporate refresh and do you think consumer is likely to stay as strong in 2010?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, we certainly have a set of numbers we are looking at inside for capacity planning, Manish, but we are not prepared to share them with you. I think if you look at what’s happened with the third party forecasts for 2010, they are now all inching above 10% unit growth and we wouldn’t argue with that and some of them may be more bullish than that as the year gets closer, so let me just leave it there. 
The other part of your question was?
Manish Goyle - C.R.E.F.
Consumer related and actually Paul, where I was heading with that is if we do get an enterprise led recovery next year, do you think your ASPs could be more stable?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, in general one of the pressures on our average selling price this year has been the absence of the normal mix of enterprise SKUs which tend to be a higher, richer mix using VPRO and things like that. So if when that market recovers, but their buying characteristics don’t change, that will be some relief on the ASP pressure that we’ve seen through the growth in the consumer side.

Your next question is from the line of Mark Lipacis with Morgan Stanley.
R. Kevin Sellers
Mark, are you there? I think we’ll go to the next question, Chanel.

Your next question is from the line of Brendan Furlong with Miller Tabak.
Brendan Furlong - Miller Tabak
A quick question on your richer product mix, CPU mix for Q4. Could you address how in general CULV is impacting the CPU mix in terms of ASPs and gross margins, et cetera? Thank you. 
Paul S. Otellini
Sure. Well, remember the CULV stands for consumer ultra low voltage, so for every CULV SKU that we have, we have a consumer non-ultra low voltage SKU and from that perspective when we ship a ULV part, we get a premium for that versus the non-ULV part. So we’ve looked at this as being a premium product taking advantage of the technology since day one. 
Now, the bulk of the units that have been shipped in that category to date were single core versions of the products. Late last quarter we introduced a dual-core version of those products. I think you’ll start seeing a number of laptops show up in retail channels with the dual core versions for the holiday season that are more ergonomically designed, thinner, lighter, a little more attractive chassis and those kinds of things, which really starts moving to where the sweet spot of I think the market is moving. 
Stacy J. Smith
Based on how you asked that question, I want to come back and just clarify one thing to make sure you didn’t misinterpret my words -- I was not predicting a richer mix in the CPU market. What I was articulating is you tend to see more chipsets sold in Q3 and more CPUs sold in Q4, so we’ll see a mix shift towards CPUs. We’re not anticipating a richer mix inside those CPUs, to Paul’s earlier answer. You know, our best guess is that the enterprise market continues to be relatively weak in Q4 and this continues to be more of a consumer led year. 
Brendan Furlong - Miller Tabak
Thank you very much.

Your next question is from the line of Tristan Gerra with Robert W. Baird.
Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird
Good afternoon. How do we view Atom strategically in your PC mix next year? We’ve seen some constraints of Atom in China and also a bit of a slow-down in netbooks in Q3. If you could give us an idea of the growth that you see for Atom and netbooks in 2010. 
Paul S. Otellini
Well, I don’t know what you mean by a slow-down -- if you mean a slow-down on the rate of growth, given that we started with relatively large -- very large growth rates in the early days, the law of large numbers kicks in. Netbooks continue to grow -- they grew nicely from Q2 to Q3, both on the component level and sales through levels near as we can tell. And I believe that they will grow again in Q4 and as Stacy points out, even if we just take a simplistic Q4 times four model for 2010, that gives you significant growth over 2009 in netbooks. So we are still bullish on it. And what we’ve seen this quarter though is that the notebook market is alive and well and that netbooks as we have been believing for quite some time are market additive for Intel and the industry. 
Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird
Great. Thank you. 
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Just a question on the gross margin in the beginning of next year, mainly from a fab start-up perspective -- remind us where we stand in the costs for ramping the China fab and then if there’s any impact from the 32-nanometer start-up occurring in the second half of this year rather than the original expectations of the first half of next. 
Stacy J. Smith
I’ll answer your question directly but I’ll also refer you back to the chart that is still on our website from the investor meeting that shows that. The expectations haven’t changed. Next year will be a year where start-up costs are reduced over this year. At the big picture level, what you have is this year we had significant start-up costs associated with 32-nanometer and we won't be starting the significant start-up costs for 22-nanometer next year. 
We do have a little bit of start-up costs associated with the fab in China, but that was included in the graph I showed you and even with that, we’ll be down and my expectations are roughly unchanged in terms of the shape of this year and the shape of next year. 
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
And what was the quantity of the China one, if you gave a precise number -- you know, a point, half a point, et cetera?
Stacy J. Smith
You can eyeball it but it’s -- you know, a little less than a point of gross margin. 
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Great. Thank you. 
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Tim Luke with Barclays Capital.
Tim Luke - Barclays Capital
Thanks. First a word on your quarter and execution -- just with respect to the gross margin outlook, Stacy, in guiding it up, your variance of three points is a little bit wider than sometimes. And also in the guidance, you mentioned that there are three points related to qualification of the sale of 32-nanometer products and the sale of previously written-off product. I guess the question is how much of it is the sale of previously written-off product? And then I guess going forward, if you could give us some color on how you feel about the sustainability of the elevated 52% gross margin and what some of the key variables might be? And I guess in the prior two questions you had some allusion to the first quarter, if you are continuing to build inventory, does that help? What are some of the key variables, both in this quarter guidance and maybe some of the variables for next year? Thanks. 
Stacy J. Smith
Now is Kevin going to count that as one question or four?
R. Kevin Sellers
I was going to say, we’ve got Uche with two -- Tim, I don’t know, I lost count. I’ll turn it over to Stacy and see if he can -- 
Stacy J. Smith
I’m not even sure how to start with that one. All right, Tim, let me take a shot. And I’ll just preface this up-front by saying I am probably going to disappoint you because I am not going to give you a point estimate for next year or a shape of the year but I’ll talk about some of the drivers. 
Q4, your first question was how much of that three points of qualification for sale of the 32-nanometer product, how much of it is sale of previously written-off product? Yeah, they are both significant drivers within that three points. I am not going to get more precise than that but they are both multi-point -- more than a point kinds of impact. 
In terms of the sustainability of 62%, I have to point out by historical standards, that 62% is pretty rare. I think it really does show the financial performance that we can generate when we have a strengthening market and we are executing well. I think it really underscores for us that the strategy, how important the strategy is of having a segmented product line, as Paul said in his prepared remarks -- having the right products at the right cost to satisfy the growth in consumer and emerging markets and Internet consumption devices with Atom and then refreshing the high-end of the product line with our 32-nanometer products. That helps a lot. 
But I wouldn’t try to argue for you that that’s the new normal. I still believe that over a long period of time, our gross margin, even inclusive of all the growth businesses, is kind of between 50% and 60%, and we are executing well and we are at the high-end now and someday we’ll be at the low. 
When I think about 2010, I’ll refer you back to a couple of the things we showed at the investor meeting. I’d expect start-up costs next year to be lower than they are this year for the question we had earlier. And -- so that will be one of the drivers. And I think that we are likely to see 2010 as we progress through the year, we’ll see the costs coming down on our 32-nanometer products and we showed a graph that showed that by the end of next year, we expect to be lower costs than ending 2009. I still expect that to be the case as we come up the learning curve on 32-nanometer and bring those costs down. 
So I think those two things give us a little bit of tailwind. 
Tim Luke - Barclays Capital
The three-point spread -- any sense there on -- why the wider range. 
Stacy J. Smith
Sorry, yeah, I knew I’d forget one of your four -- that one was just matching the top line growth. If we have -- if we end up at the top end of the revenue range, then we’ll be pushing the top end of the gross margin range. If we end up at the bottom end of the revenue range, we’re at the bottom end of the gross margin range, so it’s really just to make those symmetrical. 
Tim Luke - Barclays Capital
Thanks, guys.

Your next question is from the line of  James Covello with Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs
This has been sort of kicked around but I want to ask it a little bit of a different way -- the supply chain hasn’t really been able to catch up with end demand this year because we entered the year under-shipping demand by so much, and so much of your growth this year has been a function of that plus the better-than-expected demand relative to six months ago. As we exit this year, do you think you will still be under-shipping demand, shipping in line with demand, or shipping a little bit more than demand on sort of a quarterly basis? Thanks. 
Paul S. Otellini
I guess I have to pick a bone with your assertion, Jim. I don’t think the industry under-shipped demand in the first part of this year. People could buy a computer any day, any place on earth they wanted. I don’t know of any system level shortages that were out there, nor any component level shortages except for some spot stuff here and there but it never really constrained demand. 
James Covello - Goldman Sachs
Well, what I mean is -- maybe if I -- sorry if I wasn’t more clear; I go back to the fourth quarter of last year, PC units were down a couple of percent. Your -- Intel's microprocessor units were down 18, so you were under-shipping demand as the supply chain was liquidating inventory then. There’s been some of your tremendous growth this year -- you know, obviously great execution and demand has been better than expected earlier in the year but some of it has been a catch-up from that under-shipment towards the latter part of last year and do we think that on a quarterly basis -- what I am really trying to get at is for 2010, do we think Intel's microprocessor unit shipments should equal PC unit shipments?
Paul S. Otellini
Over the course of the year, ours plus our competition do, yes. I don’t think that the pipeline will expand -- needs to expand much more to accommodate a -- the growth numbers that are likely to happen in 2010. 
James Covello - Goldman Sachs
Yeah, that’s exactly what I was getting at. 
Paul S. Otellini
I mean, you can conceive of a corner case that by Q4 of next year at the very upper bound of people’s forecasts that the numbers get to be pretty large but you know, we’ve been here before. 
James Covello - Goldman Sachs
Terrific. Really helpful, thanks so much for everything. 
R. Kevin Sellers
Chanel, we’ll take a couple more questions, if we could. 
Operator
Your next question is from the line of  David Wong with Wells Fargo Securities.
David Wong - Wells Fargo
Thanks very much. Could you tell us what percent of your DP server sales were Nehalem in the September quarter? And did the MP server revenues grow sequentially or decline sequentially in September?
Paul S. Otellini
It was well over half of the DP sales were Nehalem and I don’t have the MP number relative growth number in my head, I’m sorry. 
David Wong - Wells Fargo
Great, thanks. 
R. Kevin Sellers
Go ahead, Chanel. Actually we’ll take two more from here. We have two more that we know of, so go ahead.

Your next question is from the line of  Mark Lipacis with Morgan Stanley.

R. Kevin Sellers
Did we get you back, Mark? I think we’ve got a technical problem. 
Operator
His line is open. 
Mark Lipacis - Morgan Stanley
Technical difficulties -- can you hear me?
R. Kevin Sellers
We got you -- go ahead, Mark. 
Mark Lipacis - Morgan Stanley
Okay. From what I can tell, server microprocessor revenues have been an increasing part of your microprocessor revenues over the last five years. It’s been a pretty steady growth trend as a percentage of your microprocessor revenues. And my question is, is there any reason that that trend should stop or have we reached some kind of saturation point and does Nehalem impact that one way or another? Thank you. 
Paul S. Otellini
Well, if you look at a five-year look back, Mark, it wasn’t consistent. There was a period in the ’06, ’07 timeframe when Intel lost some share in servers and now we’ve come roaring back, so it wasn’t always a consistent adder to our numbers over the course of the -- over the five-year period. If you take say a two- to three-year period, I think that’s a fair assumption. 
R. Kevin Sellers
Did we answer your question, Mark?
Mark Lipacis - Morgan Stanley
Yeah, so is it fair to assume then that server microprocessors as a percent of your total kind of stays steady state over time or it does not grow?
Paul S. Otellini
As a percent of the total business, the server business is running about the same as the PC unit growth numbers, to a first order -- there’s some things moving in and out in terms of DP and MP and how many chips per system and those kinds of things. The thing that could change that dramatically if is coming out of this recession, the Internet data centers start deploying and move toward some of the cloud based servers -- that could drive pretty healthy demand for rack-mounted servers and blade servers for a while. 
Mark Lipacis - Morgan Stanley
Okay. Thanks very much. 
R. Kevin Sellers
Thanks, Mark. This will be our final question, Chanel. 
Operator
Your final question is from the line of Alex Gauna with JMP Securities.
Alex Gauna - JMP Securities
Thanks for getting me in and let me also say I appreciate the new format. Can I ask you, Paul, you mentioned that right now, [inaudible] you also said this, that enterprise has not been a part of the strength. With VPRO, how do you look at when that might step in in 2010 and is there any risk to that? You mentioned cloud computing here with virtualization -- do we perhaps not see enterprise come back on the client side but stay more concentrated in the server side and what would that mean to gross margins? Thank you. 
Paul S. Otellini
The last part of your question actually gave a clarification I was going to put out up-front, which is that we are seeing pretty good strength in the enterprise relative to server part of the business. It’s the client part, the desktop and notebook part where the lights have been out for quite a while and now we are starting to see some people doing evaluation of our new platforms with Win 7. 
I can't give you a curve for that for 2010 -- it really gets down to when CEOs and CFOs set the budgets in the next couple of months for 2010 in terms of CapEx and do they want to open the checkbooks again, the compelling value for a refresh is there. Machines that are four and five years old, which is the average fleet age right now, are costing more to keep than to buy a new machine -- just the maintenance, the out-of-warranty expenses, the security upgrades, et cetera, et cetera, are problematic and you all know the situation with XP support. So people are going to want to move to Win 7 and it’s just a matter of I think how fast they do that next year. 
In terms of cloud and virtualization, our focus has been bring it on -- the data center -- the amount of data in the worldwide data centers is growing much faster than people can supply servers or deploy servers. The only solution to that anytime soon is virtualization. Virtualization typically requires new server configuration so we’ve been benefiting by this and we are not iconoclast in terms of thinking that cloud is not good for us or will not happen. 
Alex Gauna - JMP Securities
Well, just real quickly, you mentioned that the evaluations are happening -- are there any encouraging signs that we will get on the client side an enterprise uplift for VPRO or other hooks that go into virtualization or cloud computing, or will we be able to get by with some of these other more elegant ULV or CULV platforms?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, the VPRO is a client hook, not a server hook, so they are really apples and oranges in terms of cloud. I’ll just tell you that Intel is evaluating and we are going to be buying a significant number of PCs next year for our employees because we’ve been out of the market for a while and our fleet is ageing. I suspect a lot of other companies are coming to that same conclusion. 
Alex Gauna - JMP Securities
Okay. Thanks very much and congratulations on the powerful results.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Q2 2009 Intel Corporation earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today’s call, Mr. Kevin Sellers, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir. 
R. Kevin Sellers
Thank you, Christina and welcome everyone to Intel's second quarter 2009 earnings conference call. I am joined as usual by Chief Executive Officer Paul Otellini and Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith. 
As we begin our call, let me remind everyone that today’s discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. 
Following brief prepared remarks from both Paul and Stacy, we will then take questions. 
We’ve posted our earnings release and updated financial statements to our investor website, intc.com. Anyone still needing access to that information can find it there. 
We will also post on the investor website the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliations for any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned during the call. 
So with that, now let me hand it over to Paul. 
Paul S. Otellini
Thanks, Kevin. Our second quarter results were clearly better than we expected, with demand strengthening throughout the quarter. While the global economic environment is still recovering, our customers signaled increased confidence for a seasonal second half with their ordering patterns. I believe that this reflects how critical personal and enterprise computing have become to the world. 
From a consumption perspective, consumer purchases led the way with a strong rebound in mobile processor shipments. Enterprise PC volumes remain weak but server processor volumes were better than expected, driven by a strong ramp of our Nehalem based products. 
We are seeing significant interest in our new products from Nehalem based Xeon processors to Atom, to core i7 on the desktop. These are the fruits of our tick-tock strategy at work. 
Globally we saw strength in Asia-Pacific, particularly China, where their stimulus programs continue to generate meaningful growth in their PC market. The U.S. also had a strong quarter, while Europe’s recovery lagged that of the U.S. and China. 
Let me say a few words about some of our new products. 
We launched our Nehalem EP server processors at the end of Q1 and in just one quarter from launch, Nehalem already makes up over one-third of all of our dual socket server shipments. We expect the ramp to continue with Nehalem shipments crossing over the 50% market in August. 
We remain on track to launch our Nehalem EX processor line, which is the multi-processor version of Nehalem, in the second half of the year. Nehalem EX is expected to redefine the performance standard in that segment. 
Atom revenue grew a very strong 65% this quarter, reflecting a bit of a snap-back after the inventory correction we saw in late Q4 and in Q1. While netbooks are the main catalysts of the overall growth in Atom, we are pleased to see Atom now making its way into net-tops and embedded applications. 
We continue to add new customers in the embedded market segment and are pleased with the great progress Atom is making in opening up new opportunities for Intel, all with healthy product margin profiles for the company. 
Next, our recently introduced consumer ultra-low voltage mobile processors are helping to create a new PC segment of ultra-thin, full function notebooks. This product line takes advantage of two key technologies. First, our high K metal gate transistors, which allow us to create the extremely low voltage variance of our processors, and secondly we have created advanced packaging breakthroughs that significantly reduce the overall footprint and thickness of notebooks based upon these products. 
Ultra-thin notebooks are now shipping in the market and we believe they will further invigorate the notebook category and be a significant contributor to our profits in the future. 
Finally, I want to comment on some of the strategic announcements made recently that are aimed at accelerating our growth initiatives. The first is the acquisition of Wind River, which is nearing completion. This transaction is an important step for us and we expect it will contribute -- it will combine our world-class silicon capability with their world-class software and services to create a new class of differentiated products for the embedded and handheld market segments. 
Our Nokia announcement was also an important milestone as we move towards building products that will allow us to compete effectively in the handheld market segment. Our collaboration with Nokia is deep and multi-faceted. The announcement specifically referred to our open source software collaboration and the acquisition of a 3G license. Other work is underway and will be announced in the future.
In closing, I want to thank the employees of the company for their outstanding execution and attention to detail in a very difficult economic environment. Our efficiency progress and cost structures continue to be important advantages for us and our financial performance clearly reflects that. 
We are now operating with more speed and agility than perhaps at any time in the company’s history. As we continue to grow our core business and ramp our new initiatives, this agility will be increasingly important to us and to our success. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Stacey. 
Stacy J. Smith
Thanks, Paul. Second quarter sales were better than expected. In anticipation of a seasonally up second half, the supply chain began refilling inventory positions that had been depleted over the past two quarters. As a result, we experienced better-than-expected demand for microprocessors and chipsets, which contributed to $8 billion in revenue, a 12% sequential increase, the largest first quarter to second quarter growth in over 20 years. 
The company’s execution was strong and contributed to our improving financial results. The factories executed particularly well, with inventories down an additional $240 million this quarter, improvements in throughput time and yields and unit costs better tan expected across all lines of business. 
Additionally, spending was in tight control and the number of employees was down an additional 2%. The strong execution can most clearly be seen in the 5.5 point improvement in gross margin quarter to quarter. 
Despite the strengthening market and the company’s strong execution, the impact of the European Commission’s $1.45 billion fine resulted in an operating loss of $12 million, and a quarterly net loss of $398 million. 
Excluding the impact of the fine, operating profit was $1.4 billion, up 122% from the first quarter and net income was $1 billion, up 67% from the first quarter. 
On a  year-over-year basis, revenue for the second quarter was down 15%, an improvement from the 26% year-over-year decline in the first quarter. Revenue in microprocessors, including Atom, was better than seasonal patterns on higher volume and lower average selling prices. Second quarter revenue for Atom-based micorprocessors and associated chipsets was $362 million, up 65% from the first quarter. Excluding Atom-based microprocessors, overall microprocessor average selling prices were slightly lower than the first quarter.
Gross margin dollars were $4.1 billion, $800 million higher than the first quarter. Gross margin percentage at 51% was 5.5 points higher than the first quarter and the outlook that we provided in April. The largest drivers of the sequential change included a 3.5 point increase from higher CPU sales volumes, a 3.5 point increase from lower period costs, which consisted of several points from lower excess capacity charges, offset some by higher start-up costs. The increases were also partially offset a couple of points by lower CPU average selling prices. 
Spending for R&D and MG&A was approximately $2.6 billion, slightly higher than the first quarter due to higher marketing spending. In addition, we had restructuring and asset impairment charges of $91 million and the EC fine of $1.45 billion. 
For the second quarter, the number of employees is down by 2,000 from the first quarter to 80,500, primarily due to previously announced factory actions. 
Gains and losses on equity investments and interest and other income was a net loss of $38 million, smaller than our outlook of a net loss of $150 million, based on lower impairments and positive fair value adjustments on mark-to-market trading assets, as the market for certain debt instruments strengthened during the second quarter. 
Excluding the impact of the EC fine that was not tax deductible, the provision for taxes in the second quarter was at a 25% tax rate, slightly higher than the 24% previously forecasted. 
The company’s strong execution can be seen in the strength of our balance sheet. Total inventories were down an additional $240 million after the $700 million reduction in the first quarter. Total cash investments, comprised of cash, short-term investments, and debt security trading assets ended the quarter at $11.3 billion, $1 billion higher than the first quarter. 
Cash flow from operations was more than $3 billion. Capital spending was $981 million. We did not repurchase stock in the quarter and paid nearly $800 million in dividends. 
As we turn now to the outlook for the third quarter, please keep in mind that Intel's business outlook includes the Wind River transaction, which is expected to have revenue of less than $40 million and reduce EPS by about $0.01 in the third quarter. The outlook does not include the potential impact of any other mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, or business combinations that may be completed after July 13th. I will use the midpoint of the forecast ranges when making comparisons to specific periods. 
We are planning for revenue to be about $8.5 billion, plus or minus $400 million. The midpoint of this range would be an increase of 6% from the second quarter, which is in the bottom half of the historical seasonal range based on the expectation of continued weakness in the enterprise market segment. 
Our expectation for gross margin percentage in the third quarter is that it will be 53% plus or minus a couple of points. 
Anticipated improvements in the CPU business are expected to contribute three points sequentially to gross margin through higher sales volume and lower unit costs. An additional three point increase is expected from reductions in excess capacity charges and start-up costs. 
These increases are partially offset three points by inventory write-offs, primarily for the lead 32-nanometer products built prior to qualification for sale and one point for lower CPU average selling prices. 
Spending for R&D and MG&A in the third quarter should be approximately $2.8 billion, $200 million higher than the second quarter. The majority of the increase is a classification of spending as process engineers move from cost of sales to R&D. 
Additionally, in the separate category for restructuring and asset impairment charges, we expect expenses of approximately $40 million. Amortization of acquisition related intangibles primarily associated with the Wind River acquisition is also expected to be approximately $40 million. 
Depreciation is forecasted to be approximately $1.2 billion. 
Our estimate for gains and losses from equity investments and interest and other income is a net loss of approximately $80 million. The loss is higher than the second quarter because we had mark-to-market good news in our trading assets in the second quarter that we do not expect in the third quarter. 
Our forecast for full-year spending on R&D and MG&A is between $10.6 billion and $10.8 billion, $200 million higher than our prior forecast due to the addition of Wind River and higher revenue and profit dependent spending. 
Our expectation for annual capital spending for 2009 is that it will be $4.7 billion, plus or minus $200 million, lower than the previous forecast and slightly down from $5.2 billion in 2008. The reduction in forecasted capital spending is primarily due to the increased roll-forward in capital from 45- to 32-nanometer and improved factory efficiencies. 
The tax rate for the third and fourth quarters is now expected to be 23%, one point lower than the prior forecasts. 
As we end the difficult first half of 2009, it is worthwhile to reflect on the financial progress we made in the past quarter. We achieved a $1 billion increase in revenue in a quarter that is typically down. Gross margin was 5.5 points better. Spending and the number of employees were in tight control and we continue to generate efficiencies across our operations. 
We generated over $2 billion in cash from operations in excess of what was required to pay our dividends. Capital efficiency allowed us to reduce our CapEx forecast $500 million from last year. 
Over the past two quarters, inventory has decreased by over $900 million, and we will continue to extend our technology leadership as we ramp our 32-nanometer factories. 
As we look into the second half, we remain committed to maintaining the strong execution levels that have benefited us over the past six months. I am confident that the combination of a strengthening market and strong execution set the foundation for continued improvement in our financial results. 
With that, let me turn it back to Kevin. 
R. Kevin Sellers
Okay, thanks, Stacy and Paul. We’ll now be happy to take questions. In order to facilitate as many questioners as possible, each participant will be limited to one question and a follow-up. The Operator will prompt your question and then I’ll ask if you have a follow-up. 
So with that, Christina, please introduce our first questioner. 
Question-and-Answer Session

Operator
Your first question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis of Morgan Stanley.
Mark Lipacis - Morgan Stanley
Thanks for taking my question. I guess the first question would be could you provide color on channel inventories? Do you think there is restocking that went on in the channel and how do you feel about the inventories in the channel? Are they over-inventoried, under-inventoried still or about right?
Paul S. Otellini
I’ll take the first part. By channel, I think you probably mean the broad channel but let me comment on the three levels of inventory that we see. First of all, our inventory, which as Stacy said for the first half is down $900 million, so our own inventory is in very good shape. The distributor inventory that we take reserves for is also in very good shape. It was about flat quarter on quarter and that’s in a growing quarter so if anything, that could use a little bit more heft as we go into the second half. Thirdly, there’s the inventory of our products that has to sit at the OEMs and their reseller channels. Everything we’ve seen suggests that’s in pretty good shape. Our major OEMs are all on a hub [inaudible] system from us, so there’s really no likelihood of large inventory amounts in their work in process, and everything we’ve seen with our reseller channel checks suggests that’s also in very good shape. 
I think you have to -- when you look at inventory this quarter and the overall growth in the quarter, I think there’s three things going on here. First of all is that overall consumption is recovering and we’ve seen some growth in overall consumption, particularly in notebooks, consumer notebooks, as we spoke about. Second is that the inventory channel, which had dramatically depleted itself in the fourth quarter and into the first part of the first quarter, is starting to refill part of its -- to where its normal levels have been. And the third is the general view of our customers to build some inventory up in anticipation of a stronger seasonal second half. The combination of those three really is what made the quarter happen the way it did and also it give us confidence in the second half and fairly good confidence on the levels of inventory that are out there. 
And the second part of your question?
Mark Lipacis - Morgan Stanley
I think that actually covered both parts of that question. 
Paul S. Otellini
Okay, Mark. Thanks. 
R. Kevin Sellers
Do you have a follow-up, Mark?
Mark Lipacis - Morgan Stanley
Yes, please. As you look into Q3, could you give us a sense of how you are thinking about how your guidance is impacted by back-to-school spending or any kind of a corporate refresh? Thank you.
Paul S. Otellini
Well, there’s certainly some -- given the consumer notebooks and consumer sales have been the -- kind of the strongest element of this recessionary period, we’re expecting some of that to continue in some back-to-school but we are not out there thinking that there’s a recovery to prior levels in the aggregate. 
In terms of enterprise, I actually -- we are not planning for a big refresh this year. I think that there’s likely to be a refresh coming, when you look at the ageing of products that are out there, desktops in the corporate environment are about four years old, notebooks three-and-a-half years old, servers about three years old. At some point, those need to be refreshed. I think there is an opportunity for that to happen around Win 7 and our new technologies, which work pretty well together in terms of new stability and security features. 
But we’re not counting on that happening in large measures in 2009.

Your next question comes from the line of Sumit Dhanda with Banc of America Merrill Lynch.
Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Merrill Lynch 
Stacy, first question for you -- you talked about the write-offs as it relates to your 32-nanometer RAM costing you three points in gross margins in Q3. How should we think about Q4, just specifically as it relates to that element of your gross margin guidance? Should we just think about adding that back and then of course flowing it as we would normally, based on our assumptions of volumes or unit costs?
Stacy J. Smith
Yeah, good question. Let me back up and explain what that is -- it’s a pretty normal phenomenon that we see, or actually it’s a very normal phenomenon that we see. As we ramp the new process technology, up until the point that we qualify a product for sale, if we in the quarter we’ll write-off the inventory that we built on that product. That’s the lion’s share of the three points of reserve impact that you see in the third quarter forecast. And yes, you’ll see two to three points of that coming back in the fourth quarter because we won’t repeat that write-off, so that gives us a little bit of tailwind as we go into the fourth quarter. 
Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Merrill Lynch 
Okay, and then the second question again relates to inventories -- you know, down $240 million after the $700 million decline in Q1, I mean, one could almost argue that there [a little too low] days of inventory down in the 60s now, which is the lowest level we’ve seen in some time. Are you comfortable -- I mean, let’s assume that there is some upside to demand in the second half of the year, do you feel like both your throughput times as well as your current inventory profile will be adequate to serve the demand outlook?
Stacy J. Smith
Yes. There’s actually I think two elements to your question. The first is yes, inventory levels are actually a little lower than I’d like. As Paul said, that’s true when we look at our channel customers, it’s true when I look internally. What happened was we saw a  Q2 that strengthened through June and that caught us a little bit by surprise and so where I thought I was going to build a little inventory in Q2, we actually depleted inventory. 
That said, you know, I still have un-utilized capacity in the third quarter, even with my up-tick in margin, I expect to have un-utilized capacity in the fourth quarter. So we’re confident that we can respond to supply and in fact, I think I’ll keep a little more 45-nanometer capacity in place, you know, just as a precaution if this market ends up being a little stronger than we thought. 
Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Merrill Lynch

Your next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung with Citigroup.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
Paul, you know, when I look back at the history of your gross margins, from the bottom gross margin is typically in the mid-40s. It’s usually four to six quarters when you can get back to a quarter gross margin of 58% or higher. And obviously I recognize who the hell knows what’s going to happen four to six quarters from now but do you think that a 58%-plus gross margin quarter is something that’s achievable for the company on at least a one quarter basis, looking out some time in the future?
Stacy J. Smith
Yeah, Glen, let me take that and then Paul can add color commentary if he wants.  I think there’s two things to keep in mind -- one is the supply chain in general in this recession responded more quickly than it has in the past, and that’s true for the worldwide supply chain you saw the amount of inventory that came out quickly over Q4 and Q1, as well as our inventory levels came down pretty dramatically in Q4 and again in Q2, so I think that has kept the duration where we are down below what I’ve called the normal range of 50% to 60%, a little lower than we’ve seen in prior downturns which I think is a positive sign. That responsiveness of supply chain I think is healthy. 
In terms of can we be back in the upper end of that range, you know, what I said at the investor meeting is yes, I expect our gross margin profile over the next several years to not be different than what we have seen over the past several years and the majority of our gross margin readings over the last 10 years have been between 50% and 60%. I think that we can be at the upper end of that and I think there will be times where we have excess capacity charges or other things that we’ll be at the lower end of that. It really just depends on kind of the business conditions inside that quarter but there’s no fundamental reason that we can’t be at the high-end of that gross margin range. 
R. Kevin Sellers
Glen, you had a follow-up?
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
Yeah, the follow-up is actually thinking about ASPs also. So I looked at a chart of ASPs over time and what you tend to see cyclically is when we go into a down cycle, ASPs come down, I assume that’s because mix starts to move lower. But by the same token, as you go into an up cycle, ASPs actually start to improve ostensibly for the opposite reason. I wonder if you think that’s something that can occur and maybe give us your response in the context of mix with Atom and the context of a mix without Atom, just so we can get a sense as to how much Atom’s impacting that. 
Paul S. Otellini
Well, I think your analysis of prior cycles is right but I’m not sure that it will play out that way this cycle. The industry is a lot bigger and it really is segmenting much more discreetly than it ever has before in terms of the differences between servers and mobile and desktop and now netbooks, you know, all interacting with each other. 
In general, the reason we’ve done well in up cycles isn’t just demand driven but the fact that Intel has invested traditionally in new products through those and the new products are premium products and they tend to pull us out of things, or as recessions end and cycles end we tend to be able to sell those more aggressively and that’s helped us -- that part of the equation is not going to be any different. We are investing heavily in new products and they are gaining traction, as I talked about before. 
What I think is different this time is the nature of the cycle and the -- just the sheer size of the PC industry. I mean, netbooks, as they come on will have a dilutive impact on ASPs, just by definition. We’re hoping to be able to manage margins such that the margins are accretive, as we talked to you guys before. But -- and then the other secular trend is the notebook displacing the desktop and as that happens, notebooks are getting cheaper and cheaper. They will always be a little bit more than desktops but they tend to approach it, so you’ve got those all playing together. I think that -- you know, I’m not going to give you an ASP forecast out of all of this but I think you need to think about how these dynamics come together. 
The third thing would be servers. I do think that we are on the edge of a fairly strong build-out of server capacity both in enterprise and cloud over the next few years and we’re -- and Intel is particularly well-positioned to benefit from that. That will have an uplifting impact on ASP.

Your next question comes from the line of Tim Luke with Barclays Capital.
Tim Luke - Barclays Capital
Thanks so much. Congratulations on your execution. Paul, just in terms of the -- well, maybe for Stacy, actually -- you just mentioned that you -- some of the revenue had come from the refill, so just to be clear, you feel now that your OEM and channel is now at a point where you will be having more seasonal lift rather than refill lift -- would that be correct? And it also looked like the chipsets outpaced the microprocessors -- does that sort of enhance your visibility to some extent for the calendar third quarter? How should we think about that?
Stacy J. Smith
I think the short answer to both of those questions is yes. You know, what we saw was a little more predictability and a little bit of -- in terms of the sales we saw in Q2. We also saw the supply chain doing a partial replenishment from the inventory that burned off and as Paul said, when we look at the inventory in the supply chain, it looks pretty appropriate for a supply chain that’s geared up for a  seasonally stronger second half. So we don’t see anything that we would think is excess there. 
That gives us some confidence that from our customer standpoint, they are gearing up for a seasonally up second half and then as you pointed out, the chipset volume that we saw in Q2 would be kind of appropriate in Q2 for a Q3 where they are expecting some unit growth. So all of those point to what we said a quarter ago, which is the expectation that the second half of this year is seasonally up from the first half. 
Tim Luke - Barclays Capital
Do you, Stacy, as a follow-up have, or Paul, have any sense of how you perceive the introduction of Windows 7 impacting the market place in the second half of this year? In terms of seasonal pattern, I meant, Paul, rather than --
Paul S. Otellini
Yeah, I don’t know that I have an opinion on the consumer side of that one yet, Tim. You know, it really -- I heard Steve talk yesterday about they couldn’t predict exactly how it was going to play out on the consumer side. 
In the enterprise side, I gave my opinion earlier, which is I think people will go into steep evaluations starting August/September, and get ready for buys next year. And that from a cycle standpoint is a fairly traditional cycle for when an OS is released to deployed in corporate.

Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on a good quarter. Paul, my first question, on the last conference call and then again at the analyst day, you guys were pretty emphatic about Atom being much more sort of new market expansive than cannibalistic. Granted it was off of a low base but when you look at the sequential growth in the quarter, do you still feel that way? And I guess when we think about longer term Atom as a percent of the client mix, what do you think that would be?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, our view hasn’t changed, John. It’s still a lot of the 65% jump that you saw in Atom revenues this quarter really was the fact that netbooks had been built ahead of the very rapid fourth quarter drop and they were living off of inventory in the second half of the fourth quarter and mostly through the first quarter. All those netbooks sold through from our customers and now they are starting to reorder and you are starting to see that pretty dramatic quarter on quarter swing reflected in our numbers. That’s why I used the word snap-back. I don’t think there was much -- I think the end user sales probably were much more constant over that period in terms of linear growth than the kind of big jump we saw this quarter in CPU shipments. 
In terms of cannibalization, everything we’ve seen so far, both from a study standpoint and a purchase pattern standpoint and a buyer interview standpoint suggests that if there is any cannibalization, it’s at the low end of the notebook, the Celeron based notebooks that these are coming out of. And as we pointed out in the past, that’s a positive gross margin trade-off for Intel to make. And even at that, we’re talking about a total cannibalization that’s probably no more than 20%. 
I think the usage models are really differentiating between notebooks and netbooks and that will be even more clear when the new ultra-thins are out there because now if you want a thin and light notebook, you don’t have to just pick a netbook. You can pick an affordable notebook that has more functionality. 
So I think in the next six months, we’ll see greater end user differentiation between the two. 
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
And then Paul, as my follow-up, maybe a follow-up to Tim’s question, just around Windows 7 -- you said you don’t have a strong opinion around the consumer but I guess given how important the consumer is for Q3 growth, given that corporate client is still relatively weak, are you at all concerned that we could see a pause ahead of Windows 7 in the consumer market?  Or what are you seeing around linearity in the September quarter versus sort of normal trends?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, you know, July and August are rather small anyway and the operating system is the last thing that’s loaded, so it’s very possible that this is all lining up for back-to-school, Labor Day kind of things. I don’t -- I’m not privy to the exact launch date of Win 7, so I can’t opine on that. 
Traditionally though what has happened is that machines launched near the -- sold near the launch or prior to the launch have had some kind of coupon or upgrade capability and I suspect that will happen this cycle too, to be able to minimize the impact of any stall that might be out there.

James Covello - Goldman Sachs
Great. Good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question and congratulations on a very, very nice results. 
The first question is about lead times -- have you seen any stretching of your lead times at all, especially as we got to the end of the quarter and you obviously saw better business, given Stacy’s comments about inventory, you know, wanting to be flat or up a little and wind up being down?
Paul S. Otellini
No, I mean, we got a little bit out of mix on some of the low-end chipsets kind of mid-quarter but that got corrected pretty quickly. And in microprocessors, really no -- if you want parts, we’ve got them. 
James Covello - Goldman Sachs
Okay, and you’re not indicating any stretched lead times to your customers for the out quarter?
Paul S. Otellini
No. 
James Covello - Goldman Sachs
Okay, great and then my follow-up would be, if I could, the time frame that you guys think is reasonable for us in Wall Street to expect a meaningful contribution to the P&L from embedded and/or handheld?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, embedded is already meaningfully contributing. We’ve -- I think we’ve described that as a large ongoing business, well in excess of $1 billion, and that’s just -- it’s on a nice growth rate and I don’t think I want to give any more granularity than that. 
On the handheld, I think a lot of the -- you are seeing us make some progress in MID devices this year. The product that really is aimed at the sweet spot of the handhelds is the [Moore’s town] product, which is a 20-10 high volume product. 
Stacy J. Smith
Jim, if I could just add on the embedded side, as Paul said it’s a business that’s well in excess of $1 billion, growing fast and I share some information at the investor meeting a couple of months back that the gross margin, the product margin within that business is actually beyond what we get in our core client business, so it’s a very profitable business. It’s on a nice growth clip and you look at something like the Wind River acquisition that’s really meant to accelerate our efforts there and will also have spillover effect into where we want to go on the handheld market [as well].

Your next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo.
David Wong - Wells Fargo
Thank you very much. Can you give us some feel for the puts and takes on Atom’s ASP? You talked about embedded but also Atom for desktops. And separately, you guys haven’t said this but we’ve seen items in the news about giving less of a discount to companies who use Atom in netbooks above 10-inches, so can you help us understand which things suppressed ASP, which things push up ASP, and on balance whether it rises up through the rest of this year?
Paul S. Otellini
I don’t think Atom ASP is going to be materially different over the course of the year, at either the processor or kit level. You know, there really are no changes. We’ve got some variance of the product coming in. We bring in a dual-core version for the desktop later this year and things like that but for the most -- and then we’re moving to more highly integrated versions in SOC, following that. All of that is aimed at meeting the existing price points with very cost-efficient and performance efficient products. 
David Wong - Wells Fargo
Okay, thanks. And another quick one for Stacy -- Stacy, restructuring costs, do they continue for quite a long time? I mean, we’ve seen restructuring costs in every quarter. Do they keep going on going forward or do they begin to tail off at some point fairly soon?
Stacy J. Smith
Well, I think -- I guess it’s all relative. They are tailing off, David, you know, when we were just embarking on our efficiency program, you know, going through significant reductions in the employee base of the company, we were seeing restructuring charges that were running in the hundreds of millions of dollars. 
What you see this quarter is restructuring charges, it’s all employee related, it’s the actions that we announced to you back in the first quarter which are some closures of some older generation factories and some smaller assembly test factories, that the carry-over that you are seeing in Q2 is going to be the continuation of some of those actions. You can see that Q2 -- or I’m sorry, Q3 is kind of half what Q2 was, and I’d expect it to stay at some level of restructuring cost but at a pretty low level when we get into the second half of the year. 
David Wong - Wells Fargo

Your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Thanks, guys. Stacy, a question on the gross margin side of things -- other than the 32-nanometer charges going away in the fourth quarter, are there any other one-time dynamics we should include in our models?
Stacy J. Smith
Yeah, let me just pontificate a bit on what I see are some of the headwinds and tailwinds on gross margins as we go into the fourth quarter. I’ll give you some insight on what I see and I’ll preface it by saying I’m not going to give a point estimate but I’ll give you some ideas of some of the relevant trends that I see. 
So we talked about the reserve impact. I think that that should give us two to three points of gross margin tailwind from Q3 to Q4. When I think about start-up costs and excess capacity charges, I actually don’t think that they are going to be materially different in the fourth quarter than they are in the third, so I don’t think they are going to be either a headwind or a tailwind. 
If you remember what we said on start-up costs at the investor meeting, we said that they would peak in the second quarter, come down in the third, and kind of flatten out in the fourth. That’s still what I expect and similarly with excess capacity charges, you know, a big number in Q1, cut dramatically in Q2, down a bit more in Q3 and then flattens out -- again, that’s still what I expect. 
So when I kind of take those elements into account, I kind of think of my Q4 gross margin as being in the upper half of the normal range that I’ve articulated in the past. I’ve said between 50% and 60%. You know, I think that with the reserve good news, I’m likely to be in the top half of that when I get into the fourth quarter. Obviously it will be somewhat dependent on pricing and business levels and I’m not ready to put a forecast around those but you know, independent of those, I think I’m in that top half of that range. 
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Great, and then I guess while we’re talking about ranges, it’s nice that you guys are actually giving a range but it’s a little bit bigger on the revenue line than we’ve had in years past at about $800 million. What would be the dynamics, other than just simply better or worse demand that would take you to the higher low end of the $800 million range in revenue?
Stacy J. Smith
Well, I think that -- I’ll talk to the forecast range and then maybe Paul wants to add on here. The -- you know, we didn’t provide a specific point estimate for revenue in Q1 and Q2. I think that was an indication of the volatility that we were seeing in in-demand levels as well as the volatility we were seeing in the inventory levels in the supply chain. As we start Q3, you know, we’ve seen order patterns stabilizing -- in fact, improving a little bit in the consumer segment and we’re seeing as partial refilling of the worldwide supply chain, the combination of that gives us more predictability but you can’t lose sight of the fact that there still is a lot of economic volatility out there. We still see a weak enterprise market, so we think the right answer is to provide the point estimate but with a wider range because I think there’s a wider range of potential outcomes in this Q3 than what we’d normally see. 
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank

Your next question comes from the line of Stacey [Razgon] with Sanford Bernstein.
Stacey Razgon - Sanford C. Bernstein
Thanks for taking my question. A question for you on ASPs this quarter -- you said that ASPs, even excluding Atom, were still down but you had much higher growth of mobile than either of the desktops and you even spoke about strength in the server segment from Nehalem where the ASPs should be much higher. So I was wondering if you could help me understand why ASPs overall excluding those things would still be down from where they were in Q3? In particular, if you could maybe focus on the mainframe notebook side, that would be -- 
Paul S. Otellini
Sure. It’s a pretty simple answer -- it’s relative weakness in the enterprise segment of the market relative to the consumer. Enterprise tends to be a higher, more full-featured mix. That’s particularly true in notebooks. We predicted that for Q2 and that’s what we saw and as we look into Q3, the expectation is Q3 tends to be a more consumer led quarter, so we’re likely to see a little bit more of that mix towards the consumer, which gives us a little bit more of a downward pressure to ASP in the third quarter. 
Stacey Razgon - Sanford C. Bernstein
How does this continue going forward as more and more of these new consumer platforms start to ramp?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, I think I tried to answer that before, which is I think that in general you are going to see a secular decrease in average selling prices and notebooks -- notebooks, not notebook chips, as notebooks just get cheaper, as Intel integrates more and more onto a single chip, particularly for the low-end, that allows us to maintain good margins, even as the price points come down. And you are just seeing that evolution happen bit by bit now. 
Stacey Razgon - Sanford C. Bernstein
And I guess for my follow-up, if we can maybe focus a little bit on [inaudible] -- I was wondering if you could -- you used the word pontificate earlier but -- 
Paul S. Otellini
Stacy did. 
Stacey Razgon - Sanford C. Bernstein
-- the potential for COV to maybe bring pricing in the stack down as you have -- and also looking at the opportunity even potentially for upselling with that, with -- 
Paul S. Otellini
Yeah, actually I see it as more of the latter than the former. We have ultra-low voltage versions of all of our mainstream brands -- of Celeron, of Pentium, and of Core. And those ULV versions sell at a premium to the non-ULV versions in each of the brand segments. So what we are trying to do here is get an up-sell inside of every brand segment for ultra-low voltage for the technology that I talked about and the form factors that enabled. And you’ve seen our customers have a variety of patterns of introduction around that. Some customers are focusing on the core brand ULV products. Some are focusing on Pentium or Celeron to be able to enable very different price points. In all cases though, those CPUs sell at a premium to their non-low voltage brothers that we are shipping into the marketplace at the same time. 
Stacey Razgon - Sanford C. Bernstein
Even though the platforms themselves are cheaper than the typical form factors where you would see those?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, on a CPU per CPU into the same segment, if you will, performance segment, it’s higher because it takes -- it uses a higher yield effectiveness of our technology to build them. The package is a little more expensive. It uses a corner -- you know, it uses the higher performing parts of the process to be able to deliver the performance at low voltage.

Your next question comes from the line of  Uche Orji with UBS.
Uche Orji - UBS
Thank you very much. Paul, can I just ask you about the dichotomy between Europe and the U.S., and North America in terms of the quarter revenue -- is there any insight you can give us as to what’s really happening in the end market of these two markets? I think I may be wrong, but this is probably the sharpest dichotomy I’ve seen in terms of growth between Europe and the U.S. 
Paul S. Otellini
Let me try -- well first of all, the normal seasonal pattern for Europe in the second quarter would be down 15%. Europe was down a little over 9%, so it was not immune to the kind of surge we saw in other geographies but it was relative to other geographies, the only negative one. That’s why we didn’t point it out. 
And my view is two-fold -- one, Europe is a big continent in the sense that it includes not just the Western European countries but also places like Russia and the Middle East, where you’ve got a mixture of economies that are recovering fast or slowly, depending on their sensitivity to say energy prices, for example. So the patterns we saw in Western Europe are slightly different than the patterns we saw in the former Soviet Union or the Middle East and Africa, point one. 
Point two, in general, Europe went into this cycle from our perspective, from a technology sales perspective, a little later than the U.S. and I think they are coming out a little later than the U.S. And to first approximation, it looks like about a quarter, you know, three or four months difference right now. 
Stacy J. Smith
If I could maybe add one thing -- you also have to keep in mind that a lot of the demand in Europe is satisfied from production that happens in Asia-Pacific and so what you saw in the prior quarter was Asia-Pacific was down much more than the rest of the geographies. That’s a function of this worldwide supply chain kind of re-optimizing inventory levels. What you see in this quarter is Asia-Pacific is stronger than the rest of the world -- again, that’s partially a function of that refilling of the inventory pipeline and then partially a function of some real strength we’re seeing in China. I think you have to keep in mind that length of supply chain to make Europe make sense as you look at the quarter by quarter changes. 
Uche Orji - UBS
All right, that’s really helpful -- just a different question; NAND Flash, there wasn’t really much said about it this quarter. Any insight as to what contribution that may have had on the margin and also into the outlook, any insight as to how your product roadmap for NAND products are developing, that would be helpful. 
Stacy J. Smith
Sure. You know, you have to first keep in mind that NAND is a relatively small portion of our overall business. I showed some of that at the investor meeting, and so we did see pricing better in Q2 than we’d seen in the prior quarter. And then as we said over the last six to nine months, our costs are coming down at a nice clip. 
The combination of those two things gave us something less than a point of good news to the gross margin line in terms of NAND in Q2. It wasn’t at the same kind of level as what we saw with the CPU business but it certainly was positive. 
As we go into the second half, I have fairly good insight into the fact that my costs keep coming down. I watched the pricing very carefully and I’d expect it to come down a bit and the question is just going to be how much as we get into the second half, but I think I can keep it gross margin neutral over the second half just based on cost control. 
The second part of your question is you know, we also talked about moving into solid state drives and things like that and we made good progress in that. We’re getting good customer acceptance, some great industry recognition in terms of the quality of our solutions and we are in the ramp phase as we go into the second half of this year and into 2010. 
Uche Orji - UBS
So should we be expecting more meaningful contribution in 2010?
Stacy J. Smith
You know, I think it remains a fairly small portion of the overall business but we are certainly committed to keep driving the kinds of levers or pushing the kinds of levers that we’ve been pushing to improve the financial performance of the business, so we’re committed to keep doing that. 
Uche Orji - UBS

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with J.P. Morgan.
Chris Danely - J.P. Morgan
Thanks, guys. Stacy, could you give us a little more color on what the utilization rate should be tracking in the second half of the year and how much inventory or additional inventory you guys will be producing?
Stacy J. Smith
Probably not at the level of granularity that you want and it’s going to be from a shape standpoint, very consistent with what I showed in May at the investor meeting. You know, we took utilizations down to a record low in the first quarter -- in the second quarter, sorry, they get meaningfully better in the second quarter, they will get somewhat better again in the third quarter and then kind of flatten out. That’s pretty consistent with what we showed you. 
I did indicate earlier on the call that we are going to keep a bit of 45-nanometer capacity in place. We want to wait to see some of the demand signals. It’s devastating for our business to get caught short. When we get into 2010, we’ll either fill that capacity or we’ll redirect that offset 32-nanometer investment and again, we talked about that. That’s the roll-forward effect of what we can do with one generation buying capacity and capital. 
What was the second part of your question? Oh, the inventory levels -- I’m a little lower than I’d like right now. I’d like to put some inventory in place in Q3 but with the phenomenon that I talked about of the [inaudible] products that are being built prior to qualification that will end up being written off in the third quarter, my guess is that I’ll show net inventory actually down a little bit in Q3 and maybe I’ll get a bit more in place in Q4. 
Chris Danely - J.P. Morgan
Got it. And then the second question, and it might be better for your [FP&A] guys but you know, you guys look at the Intel versus the PC tracking and so if we plug in normal seasonality for Intel in Q4, your revenue will be back up to the -- up 10% year over year, which is great. However, if we look at where the PC market is tracking, that revenue will be down about 10% or more year over year in Q4, so I guess -- you know, I mean, I hear you and that’s what I hear, that inventory is very low out there but how do you guys explain the discrepancy between processor sales and PC sales?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, I think the people who track the market tend to play off of our results to a large portion and you’ll see -- I think you’ll see -- you have seen the year-over-year numbers in terms of decline, projected declines of the industry, shrink. I mean, people were talking about 15%, 18% down in January for the year. Now they are talking about 10%, 5%, and some are even projecting much lower numbers than that, closer numbers than that. 
So my sense is that the forecasting world is catching up to the reality of what’s being shipped today more than projecting where the world will really be. 
Chris Danely - J.P. Morgan
Great, thanks. That’s very helpful.

Your next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman with Broadpoint.
Doug Freedman - Broadpoint
Thanks for taking my question, guys. One for you, Stacy, if you could talk and give us a little bit of an update on the China start-up costs. I know it’s looking out a little bit ways but any updates there on what we should expect early next year?
Stacy J. Smith
No, Doug, nothing beyond what I showed you six weeks or so ago at the investor meeting. You know, we are starting up a new site -- that’s an unusual phenomenon for us that will drive a little bit of increase to start-up costs. You know, I did say for Q4 I’d expect start-up costs to be relatively flat. A portion of that is going to be the early start-up costs associated with the China factory but for 2010, you know, I’m not currently thinking it’s different than what I showed you six weeks ago and we’ll watch that as we get into next year’s investor meeting. 
Doug Freedman - Broadpoint
All right, and one for you, Paul, if you could talk a little bit about whether you feel like you have all the pieces needed now to go after more revenues in non-PC markets? You know, if I add them up, recently we’ve had deals with LG, with Cisco, with IBM, with Nokia, the Wind River deal -- do you now have everything that you need or should we consider your efforts here just starting? If you could tell us how we should think about that, that would be helpful. 
Paul S. Otellini
Well, I don’t think we have critical mass yet. I mean, we have large ambitions in the non-PC space and a lot of the design wins that we either have or would like to have have not been announced. And in many of these areas, this is a long-term trend. So I think you see very good progress here, both on the customer side and also on the infrastructure side. 
You know, when the companies were buying in the graphics area, for example, to be able to get ready for a robust software environment around Larabie and now the acquisition with Wind River for handsets and embedded -- all these are flushing out the ability to allow us to move even faster into these markets. 
R. Kevin Sellers
Thanks, Doug. Christina, we’re going to take two more questions, if that’s okay. 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of John Barton with Cowen & Company.
John Barton - Cowen & Company
-- the topic of embedded, Paul, in the previous response you had talked about embedded being a $1 billion company. Obviously that’s things other than Atom. In your prepared statements when you are talking about Atom revenue, you said primarily driven by netbooks but also net tops and embedded. Could you give us a feel for how Atom is doing embedded, and maybe kind of weave within there how the relationship with PSMC is working?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, I did that at the analyst meeting. I’m trying to remember from then in terms of what I talked -- I think I talked about 1,200 new designs in Atom in embedded space, and out of that there were 120, 150 customers that were new to Intel as a result of that. So what we see is converting of our existing embedded customers to Atom-based designs and other newer generation of products. Then we also see new customers coming in but we are taking architectural share in embedded from power and to some extent, from MIPS, the higher end products that sell in those segments. 
I think that continues as we share our system on chip roadmaps with embedded customers because that allows them to be able to do all of these solutions with high performance and one single product, one single chip product. 
And to me, this is just a -- you know, we’ve been in embedded for 25 years and these are long design cycles but then the design cycles play out for a long time in terms of production and that’s why the business tends to give you a very nice gross margin profile. 
John Barton - Cowen & Company
And then as my follow-up, if I could, you’ve made reference to the fact that the usage models are really starting to find themselves as it pertains to netbooks. Can you give us some insight as to what you are seeing in sales trends for netbooks, particularly as it pertains to developed economies, developing economies, et cetera?
Paul S. Otellini
They are still principally developed economies or tier one cities in emerging markets, in places like Shanghai or Beijing. I think that you will start seeing that spread into more emerging markets as the global economy recovers and system price points continue to come down. The primary usage model that we’ve studied in places where there is the highest buyer satisfaction is where they align around a principally Internet based model.   
When people try to do 3D games on these things or try to run their office applications on them, they tend to think it’s a bit slow and that isn’t just the processor, it’s the entire architecture. 
So I think you are seeing a model emerge that is a third usage category and that’s likely to be -- to have a higher contrast between those products and notebooks, as the ultra-thin products come to market. 
John Barton - Cowen & Company
Thank you. 
R. Kevin Sellers
Thanks, John. Christina, this will be our last question. 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Gus Pritchard with Piper Jaffray.
Gus Pritchard - Piper Jaffray
First question is on the Atom, how much has the advent of the carrier and selling those through that channel helped the Atom sales in the second quarter and how do you see that playing out going forward?
Paul S. Otellini
It hasn’t had a -- I can’t use the word material here -- it’s not the driver at this point in terms of sales to date. We see a tremendous amount of interest from the carriers in conjunction with both OEM and ODMs to participate in this business. I think in 2010 that’s likely to be a large part of the business. You’ve seen some very interesting existent points of this. There was a Best Buy, Sprint netbook ad last week at $0.99 if you signed up for two years, I think it was. And you’ll start seeing more of that but I don’t think that’s the prime driver. I know it’s not the prime driver to date. You’ll start seeing more of that into the holiday season this year. 
Gus Pritchard - Piper Jaffray
And then my follow-on question is given the fact that inventory up and down the food chain is pretty lean, you guided to sub-seasonal growth in Q3 and I was just wondering what’s the hesitation to your more normal seasonal growth?
Stacy J. Smith
Two comments to that -- first of all, keep in mind Q3, you typically see an inventory build in the seasonal patterns. And then secondly, it’s really just an indication of a continued expectation that the enterprise market will stay weak in Q3 and frankly, we expect that throughout the second half of this year. We’re not anticipating client sales in the enterprise to pick up this year. 
Gus Pritchard - Piper Jaffray
So effectively, the build happened a little bit earlier in terms of seasonal builds in Q2?
Stacy J. Smith
Well, the expectation is there will be a bit more build in Q3 and anticipation of an even higher Q4. That’s kind of how seasonal patterns work but that’s in the seasonal comparison, so -- we normally see that. 
Gus Pritchard - Piper Jaffray
Got it. All right, thank you.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Q1 2009 Intel Corporation Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Kevin Sellers, Vice President of Investor Relations. 
Kevin Sellers
Welcome, everyone, to Intel's first quarter 2009 earnings conference call. Joining me on the call are Chief Executive Officer, Paul Otellini, and Chief Financial Officer, Stacy Smith. This call is being webcast live and a replay will be posted to our website at around 5:00 Pacific Time and will remain there for about two months.
Second, a reminder for everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. And current uncertainty in global economic conditions makes it particularly difficult to predict product demand and other related matters and makes it more likely that Intel's actual results could differ materially from expectations. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could affect our results. So with that, let me now hand it over to Paul.
Two quick items as we begin, first, if during this call we use any non-GAAP financial measures or references, we will post appropriate GAAP financial reconciliations to our investor website, intc.com, after the call.
And lastly, we have scheduled our annual investor day on May 12 and 13 at the Intel headquarters in Santa Clara. We look forward to seeing many of you there. If any of you need additional information about this event, please contact Intel Investor Relations directly.
So with that, now let me turn it over to Paul.
Paul Otellini
Our first quarter results clearly reflected the depth of the efficiency work in which we’ve been engaged over the past three year. While the global economy continues to be weak and uncertain, our execution this quarter was outstanding. We have adjusted quickly to this new environment where demand remains difficult to predict and order lead times have contracted.
As we indicated in our last earnings call, we made significant reductions in our weaker starts to bring inventory in line with the new demand environment. These actions resulted in an inventory reduction of 19% below the fourth quarter levels. Our spending is being controlled and the number of employees declined by 1,400 from Q4 levels. 
Almost all the headcount reductions in Q1 and in 2009 will be focused on aligning our factory network to the new demand levels while accelerating our conversion to newer silicon technologies.
Our product development machine is in high gear, delivering a new generation of products in all segments. We believe that these products extend our lead in our core businesses and position us for significant growth in the new markets we are targeting.
In terms of demand, we saw a few important trends play out this quarter. First, we are seeing signs that a bottom in the PC market segment has been reached. I believe the worst is now behind us from an inventory correction and demand level adjustment level perspective. We saw order patterns strengthen throughout the quarter. Desktop sales appear to have hit bottom first and have followed more normal patterns since early February. In notebooks, the length of the supply chain and higher levels of inventory took longer to work through but now have returned to normal levels.
In terms of end-user consumption, the consumer segment has held up much better than the enterprise. This is particularly true in consumer notebooks, which continue to be the volume driver in this segment. Netbook sales continue to grow as anticipated and are clearly incremental volume for us in a difficult market.
In the enterprise segment, the server portion is in reasonable shape, partially reflecting demand for our newly released dual-processor products. The client portion remains weak, reflecting constrained budgets and redeployment of older equipment. The install base of enterprise notebooks is now over three years average age and will need to be upgraded as capital budgets free up.
Lastly, in terms of end markets, we saw the U.S. and China demonstrate relative strength while Europe, Japan, and the emerging markets showed continuing weakness.
Looking forward, I want to comment on our product and technology direction. First, we recently launched the dual-processor server versions of our Nehalem family of products and the market reception has been remarkable. Nehalem is no ordinary upgrade. These products reflect the single largest increase in server performance we have ever delivered, generation to generation and enabled revolutionary advances in performance and performance per watt metrics.
At launch we had over 230 designs using the new Intel Zion 5500 across all of our OEMs with a fully-stocked distribution channel ready to support a fast ramp. This family offers enterprises the opportunity to improve their capability while lowering their cost of computing. I expect that value proposition to be extremely important during these challenging economic times.
If you combine the core I-7 and the Intel Zion 5500 processors, this week Intel expects to ship its one-millionth Nehalem-based microprocessor, demonstrating that the market still responds to the best performing products.
Our 32-nanometer process is very healthy and shows great promise for us. This is the reason we recently announced a $7.0 billion investment in plants and equipment to accelerate high volume deployment of this technology.
We have pulled in Westmere, our fist 32-nanometer product family, and will now be shipping those products later this year. We have shipped thousands of Westmere samples to over 30 EOM customers already. We also look forward to the launch of our new consumer ultra low voltage products which will enable many new thing and light notebooks at very compelling price points.
In closing, while it is clear that our end markets are still impacted by the global financial conditions, we are comfortable with our investment levels and capacity profile. We expect business conditions in Q2 to mirror those in Q1 with some gradual recovering of demand and replenishment of inventories occurring as the industry sees increasing signs of stabilization and a return to more normal seasonal trends.
With that, let me now turn the meeting back over to Stacy.
Stacy Smith
Our first quarter results were stronger than anticipated, despite the significant impact of the weakened worldwide economy, reduced PC demand, and supply chain inventory correction. As we begin the second quarter, we are on track to reduce our 2009 spending by $700.0 million from 2008. We have brought inventories down by approximately $700.0 million from last quarter on the strength of our business model and balance sheet, allowing us to make investments in 32-nanometer factory capacity that is planned to begin production in the fourth quarter.
Revenue for the first quarter was $7.1 billion, down 13% from the fourth quarter and down 26% from a year ago. Revenue of microprocessor, including Atom, was below seasonal patterns on lower volume and approximately flat average selling prices.
First quarter revenue for Atom-based microprocessor and associate chip sets was $219.0 million, down 27% from the fourth quarter as a result of reductions in downstream inventory.
Excluding Atom microprocessor, overall microprocessor average selling prices were also approximately flat to the fourth quarter. Revenue was down sequentially and year-over-year in every geography and both the digital enterprise group and the mobility group. 
The digital enterprise group revenue was down 11% sequentially to $4.0 billion and there were clear signs that the shorter inventory pipeline resulted in more normal order patterns for much of the quarter.
The longer inventory pipeline in mobile products contributed to the mobility group revenue down more than the digital enterprise group, with a 17% sequential decline, however, even in mobile, our shipment patterns returned to more normal levels by the end of the quarter. 
In the factories we accomplished our objectives for the first quarter by reducing inventory levels by lowering builds and executing to the start up of our 32-nanometer process technology.
Gross margin dollars were $3.3 billion, $1.1 billion lower than the fourth quarter. Gross margin percentage of 45.6%, or 7.5 points lower than the fourth quarter, and better than the low-40% outlook that we provided in January.
Approximately 6 points of the sequential decline came from under-utilization charges and about 2 points came from higher start up charges as we began the ramp of 32 nanometer. Versus our expectations, under-utilization charges were better by 2 points as we increased factory utilization earlier than anticipated.
Additionally, the NAND business performed a little better than forecasted, lending some gross margin improvement. 
Spending for R&D and MG&A was approximately $2.5 billion, consistent with the forecast and down slightly from the fourth quarter. In addition, we had restructuring and asset impairment charges of $74.0 million.
For the first quarter, the number of employees is down by 1,400 from the fourth quarter, to less than 83,000, a reduction of 20,000 employees from the start of our restructuring program in 2006.
Gains, losses on equity investments and interest and other income was a net loss of $18.0 million, a smaller loss than both the fourth quarter and our outlook. Compared to the fourth quarter the loss is primarily lower as a result of the fourth quarter reduction and the carrying value of the company’s investments in Clearwire.
Relative to outlook, it was better based on positive par value adjustments, on mark-to-market trading assets as the market for certain debt instruments strengthened during the first quarter.
The provision for taxes in the first quarter was at a 1% tax rate, lower than the 27% previously forecasted, driven primarily by the settlement of various federal and state tax matters related to prior years and a higher percentage of profits in lower tax jurisdictions.
Total inventories were down $699.0 million, or 19%, from the fourth quarter. Total cash investments, comprised of cash, short-term investments, and debt security trading assets, ended the quarter at $10.3 billion, $1.2 billion less than the fourth quarter.
Capital spending was $1.5 billion. We paid nearly $800.0 million in dividends and did not repurchase stock in the quarter. 
As we turn now to the outlook for the second quarter, please keep in mind that unless otherwise specified, the forecasts do not include the effects of any new acquisitions, divestitures, or similar transactions that may be completed after April 13. I will use the midpoint of the forecast ranges when making comparisons to specific periods.
The worldwide economic situation continues to create a high degree of uncertainty around demand, therefore we believe there remains a broader range of possible outcomes for the second quarter. In light of the uncertainty in the current environment, rather than provide precise ranges for typical outlook items, we will provide business drivers for some items and wider-than-typical ranges for others.
Intel is not providing a revenue outlook at this time. For internal purposes we are currently planning our business for revenue, which is typically lower in the second quarter, to be about flat to the first quarter.
Our expectation for gross margin percentage in the second quarter is it will be in the mid-40s. Quarter to quarter, lower under-utilization charges are expected to improve gross margin by about 5 points and be offset by lower average selling prices, higher unit costs, and a higher 32-nanometer start up charges.
Spending for R&D and MG&A in the second quarter should be approximately $2.5 billion. Additionally, in the separate category for restructuring and asset impairment charges, we expect expenses of approximately $115.0 million. 
Depreciation is forecasted to be approximately $1.2 billion.
Our estimate for gains and losses from equity investments and interest in other income is a net loss of $150.0 million. The loss is higher than the first quarter for a few reasons. First, we had mark-to-market good news in our trading assets in the first quarter that we do not expect in the second quarter. Additionally, we expect lower gains in our portfolio of equity securities and lower interest income.
Our forecast for full year spending on R&D and MG&A is between $10.4 billion and $10.6 billion, unchanged from the prior forecast.
Our expectation for annual capital spending is now that it will be slightly down from 2008.
The tax rate for each of the remaining quarters in the year is now expected to be 24%, 3 points lower than the prior forecast, based on a higher concentration of profits and lower tax jurisdictions.
The impact of the global recession on the PC supply chain was significant and can clearly be seen in our first quarter results. Despite this weak market, our execution was excellent and we ended the second quarter with healthy inventory levels, a great product portfolio, and the benefit of having driven our cost structure down over the past three years.
While in-demand levels are still unclear, the investments we are making in 32-nanometer and in new products will provide us significant financial and competitive advantage.
With that, let me turn it back to Kevin.
Kevin Sellers
We will now be happy to take questions. As has been our practice recently, we would like to limit each participant to one question and a follow-up. 
Question-and-Answer Session

Operator
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Stacy, could you walk us through the gross margin trade-offs into the second quarter and specifically why the assumption on ASPs going down to offset the under-utilization charges also dropping?
Stacy Smith
We are forecasting a gross margin that’s in the mid-40%. You can think of that as being approximately flat to where we were in Q1. What you see is a couple of things that offset, so we will get about 5 points better in excess capacity. You know, we started reloaded the factories in Q1 a little earlier than expected, so we will see some significant increases to utilization that drives some gross margin good news.
Offsetting that, then we have a few smaller items. One, as you said, is average selling prices. That really is a mix issue. As Paul said in his speech, we expect the enterprise market to continue to be relatively weaker. A higher percentage of our shipments are going to go into consumer, which is a more price-sensitive segment of the market, so we will see a mix down in average selling prices in the second quarter. That’s our prediction.
The second item is we expect our costs to increase a bit in the second quarter. What we’ll be shipping in the second quarter are products that we built in Q4 and Q1. We built those products in factories that were underloaded to carry a higher cost in inventory and so that will cause our shipment costs to go up a bit in the second quarter.
And then, we are going to see our 32-nanometer start-up costs peak in the second quarter and that’s pretty consistent with what we’ve seen in prior generations and what we showed you in last year’s analysts meeting. You know, we see a significant increase from Q4 to Q1. That’s in our gross margin and it will go up a bit more in Q2 and then we expect it to start coming down pretty rapidly when we get into the second half of the year.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
What do you expect your internal inventory to do and any commentary on the end-market inventory that’s been burnt more on the channel side of things.
Stacy Smith
Those two things are obviously related. I will start with the channel inventory question first. As we do our checks of channel inventory levels, we saw a significant burn off of the overhang of inventory that we had seen in Q4 and the beginning of Q1. If anything, that burnt off a little more quickly than we thought. That’s what allowed us to start lowering our factories. And then you can see that in our inventory levels. You know, we dropped significantly from Q4 to Q1.
And actually I would say for our inventory levels, we are probably a little lower than we would like. In general, when we look at channel inventories, they look generally lean across the supply chain. As we think about a seasonal second half, on the back of a pretty weak first quarter, we will probably grow inventories a little bit as we go into Q2. I don’t think it will be significant but I think it will be up a little bit.
Operator
Your next question comes from Gus Richard - Piper Jaffray.
Gus Richard - Piper Jaffray
I notice that the op margins for the mobility group were down significantly in the current quarter and I was just wondering if you could explain the variance. Is that a mix issue or is it just that in combination with under-absorption of that group?
Stacy Smith
There are really two things that are driving it. I think Paul and I both talked about it in our prepared remarks. And in fact, we talked about it at the end of last quarter. The inventory pipeline for mobile products is quite a bit longer than the inventory pipeline is for desktop products, and so what we see is revenue is down more in mobile because it just took longer to burn through that overhang of inventory. And it wasn’t until we got to the end of the quarter that I would say those inventory levels looked a little bit more normal.
So percentage-wise on revenue, based on the limit of that inventory pipeline, mobile is down more than desktop. And then secondly, mobile is the majority of what we run in our factories now. We had that cross over for our internal business last year so they pick up well over half of the excess capacity charges. And it’s the combination of those two things that impacted the operating margin for MG in Q1.
Gus Richard - Piper Jaffray
Was there a mix related to that in terms of consumer notebooks versus enterprise notebooks, also pushing down operating margins, or was that just not a factor in Q1?
Stacy Smith
I would say that was not a significant factor in the first quarter. It was really just the revenue being down based on the length of that inventory pipeline and the excess capacity charges.
Operator
Your next question comes from Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James.
Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James
You didn’t mention Larrabee. It was highlighted at the IDF in Beijing. Can you give us an update in terms of the timing of this product, and the wafer that was shown, or Pat showed it, it looked like the chips are pretty large. Can you give us a sense in terms of the size of the chip? Is that within expectations?
Paul Otellini
Let me cover the second question first. Yes, the size of the product is within expectations. It’s a multi-core device. What you saw on that wafer was the high-end version of it. There are obviously other versions of it that have far fewer cores for different price points. So what you saw is the extreme version, I’ll put it that way.
In terms of the product, we have for silicon, it’s in debug now and we’re marching towards production of that product. The silicon will get ready, or get better, over the course of the year. The software gets finished over the course of the year. I would expect volume introduction of this product to be early next year.
Operator
Your next question comes from Uche Orji – UBS.
Uche Orji - UBS
Paul, given the visibility you have, how much of what you’re seeing at the moment is [inaudible] talking and when do you think that process will end. I know you mentioned it carries on into Q2 but just to scale it, when do you think, how much of that is talking versus that there is masking with underlying weak demand and to when do you think that process will be done?
Paul Otellini
I think there was some replenishment of Intel chips at our OEMs customers in the first quarter but certainly not a number that I think would reflect full inventory levels. I think everyone is still running very lean. We actually have seen some expedites in the March time frame of can you get us product real fast, we’re running out of end-user built up product, etc.
So I think you’re still seeing that. And my sense is it will stay that way until the second half of this year when you start seeing normal seasonal growth return into the business.
Uche Orji - UBS
And just looking back onto the gross margin question that was asked earlier, from a product standpoint, there are two questions I have. The first is the CULV. You talked about that in your opening remarks. What do you think is the potential for that to upsell netbooks and where will that come in in terms of margins? And then Nehalem, I understand that enterprise still remains fairly weak but one would expect that a product like that should have some pent-up demand. How much are you going to see in Q2 or should we expect the bulk of that to come in in Q3 and Q4?
Paul Otellini
We do think, and we’ve been saying this for about a quarter now, that the big trend in notebooks this year, starting midyear, is likely to be very well designed thin and light notebooks, using the CULV, or ultra low voltage products that you referenced. And I think you will see those at very attractive price points. Up to this point in time, those machines have been sort of executive jewelry. And I think they will hit mainstream consumer price points, and we are expecting that to be, that in itself will be a more clear distinguishing set of characteristics between netbooks and notebooks.
In terms of netbooks, you heard Stacy talk about the Atom revenue from Q4 to Q1 and that clearly dropped more than Intel. So what we saw in the first quarter was continuing good sales of netbooks in terms of sales out, but they were living off some inventory that was built in the fourth quarter. My sense of that is approached equilibrium at this point in time as well.
On Nehalem, on the core I-7 which is the workstation and high-end desktop product, that’s been shipping since November. It’s in very good volume now for that segment of the market, although it is a fairly high-end segment of the market.
The real interesting is what happens on the dual-processor server product. About half the volume that I referenced was in servers, about half of it was in the desktop machine. So that gives you some idea of the slope of this product. We see this as a premium product. It is the best product in the marketplace, so you will see us maintain a premium pricing profile for this product for a while.
Operator
Your next question comes from David Wong - Wachovia Capital Markets.
David Wong - Wachovia Capital Markets
A little further on Uche’s question. Given that Nehalem is ramping in two-way servers beginning in the second quarter would you expect sequential sales in your overall two-way server processors in the second quarter?
Paul Otellini
Would we expect them?
David Wong - Wachovia Capital Markets
Sequential sales growth for two-way servers overall.
Paul Otellini
Do we expect two-way to grow?
David Wong - Wachovia Capital Markets
Yes.
Paul Otellini
I don’t know that I want to give that level of granularity on guidance. I think that what I said is that the server segment to the enterprise has maintained resilience in this and we are actually seeing that there is a very good value proposition buying a new Nehalem DP server and for a consolidation for space and for virtualization and eliminating older equipment. So it’s a total cost of ownership benefit.
I think that’s the metric to watch over the next quarter. My sense is enterprise budgets, of all types, are going to be constrained for a while.
Stacy Smith
I think you have to separate the two things. Nehalem will clearly ramp as a percent of the total. The question mark we would have is the overall strength of the enterprise market going forward. And what we’re seeing is that enterprise budgets are locked down pretty tight and CIOs are going to let their fleets age a bit until they get a little more clarity on what the economy looks like.
David Wong - Wachovia Capital Markets
And just a clarification of Paul’s comment on Westmere. First shipments this year. So are we going to see systems with Westmere ramping this year or is it Intel starts shipping and we will see the first systems with Westmere the beginning of next year?
Paul Otellini
I’m not going to speak to system launch. I will reiterate what I said, which is that Intel will ship its products this year.
Operator
Your next question comes from Glen Yeung – Citigroup.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
Paul, this is a question for you, and oddly enough it’s actually a longer-term question. When you think about a base line of PC growth, and we can argue about what it is, but let’s for argument sake saw somewhere between 6% to 8% long-term growth. And then you layer on top of that your opportunity in netbooks, in CULV, and embedded. How do you then think about how that may enhance, or may not, Intel’s growth relative to the base line PC growth rate?
Paul Otellini
You said CULV, I think you meant hand-held for that third bucket. But that’s something I intend to talk quite a bit about at the analysts meeting so I’m going to duck it a little bit now. But I think that it’s appropriate to say that we would expect, in units, those three new markets to be at least as big as the PC market for us in the not too distant future. And that’s the goal we have, as a company.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
The second question follows in that so hopefully you kind of answer this one too. When you think about where Intel is on physical capacity. Just the amount of chips that you’re able to build. And I recognize you shut some older fabs down. Do you feel comfortable now that you have the right amount of capacity. Now, I’m not actually suggesting that you have too little, I wonder if you think you have too much. You know, for the growth that you may see in the next one to three years, for example.
Paul Otellini
In that time frame the bulk of the capacity is going to be 32-nanometer and that reflects back to the announcement we made in February on the $7.0 billion of plant equipment to bring four factories on line with that technology. We modeled that out pretty carefully. If anything, that’s a little bit more capacity than we would normally have for that kind of generation for two reasons.
One, these growth opportunities that you asked about earlier. And the other is that in that generation, that’s when we start incorporation much of the chip set, including graphics, onto the microprocessor. So, I don’t see that being a situation we’re long on. If anything we could be a little tight on it.
In the short term, we do worry about opportunity costs and not being able to satisfy and unforecasted snap back or uptick and we’re being very careful about that. We do not want to not have the ability to satisfy all of the demand that comes our way.
Stacy Smith
That leads into a comment on the second half from an excess capacity standpoint. When we look at the existing capacity we have in place, I think utilizations will continue to grow into the second half. It will take our utilization back into what I call historical range as we get to the end of the year. Even with modest seasonal growth patterns I’m not worried that we have too much capacity on 45-nanometer generation products. And then when we get out to next year, the balancing act that we’ll play is if overall demand is less, we can roll forward some of that 45-nanometer investment to fund part of the 32-nanometer ramp. That’s one of the levers we have we can play in that kind of time period.

Your next question comes from Doug Freedman – Broadpoint AmTech.
Doug Freedman – Broadpoint AmTech
Paul, can you talk a little bit about things that you need, you talked a bit about acquisition strategy here. In the quarter you have increased your shelf filing. Can you give us an idea of where and what type of activities you’re looking at over the next three months or even longer term?
Paul Otellini
There are really two different things. The shelf filing was done just to give us the flexibility. We’ve had one in the past that had expired and we decided to renew it just so we would have the capability to utilize the stock if we had the choice.
What you have seen us do in the last two years is a series of relatively small acquisitions, something in the 9 to 10 range of companies, none of them more than a few hundred million dollars. And I think that tends to be our pattern at this point in time. We are looking at companies that have great technology, that can utilize our silicon capability or our channels’ and fill holes in our product portfolio to flush out our platform strategy. And we’ve been very successful with that kind of acquisition strategy. That’s the one that I like, at this point.
Doug Freedman – Broadpoint AmTech
You mentioned that you have pulled in Westmere in your 32-nanometer launch. Have you don’t similar things with some of the chip set products in trying to move them onto advanced nodes? How are those programs moving along and is there any accelerated progress there?
Paul Otellini
Well, the chip sets actually go through a transition here. As we bring the memory controller and some of the other functions onto the microprocessor we can have a more benign process profile relative to some of the remaining functions that would go into what we now call chip sets. 
And that’s one of the reasons that we’re bringing on the factory in Dalian, in China. That factory is likely to be our long-term chip set factory and that will be two generations off the leading edge. And obtained at low cost stable products that will run for a number of years.

Your next question comes from Sumit Dhanda -Banc of America Securities.
Sumit Dhanda -Banc of America Securities
A couple of questions. Stacy, the first one, just trying to understand your comment about higher unit costs where you indicated that some inventory from, or some build from Q4 and Q1 will flow through to Q2. I guess my question is, given the big reduction you’ve seen in throughput times, why is that necessarily the case that inventory from two quarters ago would hit your P&L in this quarter?
Stacy Smith
Remember, we grew a lot of inventory in Q4 which was why we were so aggressive in trying to bring down our inventory in Q1. And even with the reductions that we’ve made through throughput time, you tend to see the time through the factory and then the time where product fits in inventory. It tend to be a little greater than a quarter. So the stuff I’ll be selling in Q2 are products that were built at the end of Q4 and into Q1 where my utilization rate was higher.
And then overtime, as the factories get reloaded, the cost that sits in inventory will be less.
Paul Otellini
I would also point out that the inventory that we have in microprocessor is all with niche technology. It’s all 45-nanometer product.
Sumit Dhanda -Banc of America Securities
The second question, basically a question on clarification. Just as I’m thinking about the underloading charges here, you had a 3 point hit in Q4, an additional 6 point hit in Q1, and you’re getting 5 points back, so is it fair to think you’re getting 5 out the total of about 9 points back by Q2? 
And then, I guess the second question along those same lines, between higher unit costs, higher start-up costs and lower ASPs, could you bucket, you know, which one is contributing more to the drag and which one is less into Q2?
Stacy Smith
Let me answer those in the order you asked them. So, yeah, you are thinking about the start up costs in roughly the right numbers. The other way to look at this is if you look at, I’m sorry excess capacity costs. The other way to look at it is you look at it in relative to a year ago. So Q1 2009 versus Q1 2008. There’s close to about 10 points of gross margin hit based on excess capacity. It’s right in that range. And we’re going to get about half of that back in Q2 and then I expect to get the rest of that back sometime in the second half.
And then your question on the bucketing of the different charges. Think of them as all kind of being between one and two points of gross margin. So no one of those is nearly as significant as the improvement in excess capacity charges. They just all happened to move the other way and offset some of that good news.
Operator
Your next question comes from John Pitzer - Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
Stacy, on the Q2 gross margin guidance, the 500 basis point hit you get from the improvement in utilization, the three factors you talked about, how does that break about between each? Is a third, a third, a third, or could you specifically talk about 32-nanometer start up costs and how they trend from Q1 into Q2?
Stacy Smith
Yes, as I just said, they’re all between one and two points, neither one is hugely significant relative to the others.
In terms of the startup cost piece in particular, you should think about in terms of the trend that we’ve shown you in prior generations and the trend we showed more or less a year ago for this year. A significant increase in Q1, they go up a bit more in Q2, and then they start coming down pretty rapidly in Q3. We expect the same trend on 32-nanometer that we saw with 45-nanometer in the generations prior to that.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
That’s a good lead in to my second question. Off the December quarter conference call you talked about second half margins kind of returning to more healthy levels and I don’t think you formally endorse something above 50 but I’m wondering if you could talk about, in the context of what you said in January, what your expectations are for second half margins.
Stacy Smith
The same. And I think I did pretty much formally endorse it. I said I look at a normal gross margin for us of being between 50% and 60% and there’s not a ton of science behind that, that’s just if you look at the last ten years, 75% or so of our gross margin readings are between those two points. 
With the improvement in the excess capacity charges and the improvement in the start-up costs over the course of the second half I expect to get back into that normal range. I expected that a quarter ago, I still expect that today.
Operator
Your next question comes from Edwin Mok - Needham & Company.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company
I have a question on capex, you might have [lowered] your capex a little bit. Can you talk a little bit about that?
Stacy Smith
We did bring down our view a little bit of capex this year. We now expect to be slightly down from 2008. 2008 it was $5.2 billion. You should think of that as, you know, as has been our history over the last few years, we were able to find some efficiencies that brought capital spending down a bit. It does not change our overall strategy. 
What I articulated last quarter is that the majority of our capital spending in 2009 is to get to the first production set on 32-nanometer. Still absolutely moving to that. We’re not slowing down that ramp at all. But the factories were able to find some efficiencies that brought some confidence to the fact that we will be down a bit as opposed to flat. 
We’re still looking hard for those efficiencies across the business, in capital and across the operational spending line and I am hopeful we will have some success in finding them.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company
And just a follow-up question on the ASP. You mentioned that mix was the reason why you expect ASP to be down sequentially because of more consumer products. What about pricing for the product? Any reason that you might want to adjust the pricing? There’s some talk that you might be considering raising price on the Atom.
Paul Otellini
No, our price moves are fairly well telegraphed to our customers a number of months in advance. There are new versions of Atom coming out. We talked about a dual-core version. That will cost more than the single-core version but other than that, no, we’re not looking at raising prices.
What we are trying to drive, and what we always try to drive is try to sell the richest mix possible. That’s a little more taxing in this environment, particularly when you have things like the enterprise, which tend to buy a relatively high mix of products, keeping their wallets shut for a while.
Operator
Your next question comes from Tim Luke - Barclays Capital.
Tim Luke - Barclays Capital
Paul, I was wondering if you might be able to give some color on how you perceive sort of broader visibility and how you might compare that to the conversation from January. You talked about a bottom in the PC market and possibly some month-over-month improvement as you went through the quarter. On the other side of that your guidance was sort of flat, or somewhat similar, although it’s not formal. But just general color on how you see the marketplace and to what extent there is any visibility.
Paul Otellini
I can try. I think that, first of all, when we said we are planning our business flat in this environment, you have to remember that traditionally the second quarter is seasonally below the first quarter, so that alone, at least internally, is a sign of how we view the world.
In terms of visibility, three months ago we were sitting in a fragile global economic environment and we had just come off of a horrendous Q4 and we weren’t sure where sales out were of PCs. Three months later we’re still sitting in a fragile global economic environment but we’ve got three or four months of fairly good trending in terms of where the business is, what the inventory levels are, what geographies are still buying product, what segments are still buying product. 
And so the global environment hasn’t changed but our ability to look and plot some points, historical points, has given us the confidence to essentially say that the industry has seen the bottom. And I feel pretty comfortable in that, having done this for more than a few years.
Tim Luke - Barclays Capital
Do you fell then that seasonality is likely to be somewhat similar to broader seasonal patterns in the second half? Do you have any color there? And as part of that, I have noticed in the past that you’ve talked about chip sets being directionally sometimes helpful, but the mobility chip sets were down 21%. Maybe that’s just because they were weak at the beginning of the first quarter, but any color there?
Paul Otellini
That goes back to the backline. Desktops are a business which is very, very quick—most of them are simple to order. 40% of desktop chips go through our industrial distribution channels. They’re sold in white boxes for the most part. So there is essentially no inventory on those and that’s why when we saw that stabilizing in the early part of the quarter, that was the first stake in the ground in terms of trying to figure out where the business was.
The notebook business, we talked about this last time, not only has a longer supply chain, and most of it is branded, much of it was put on boats in the third and fourth quarter to save fuel costs. And there’s a lot of inventory built ahead of the holiday season in Q4 that had to burn off. We now believe that the vast majority of that has burned off. 
All the patterns we’ve seen on chip sets for mobile and on microprocessors for mobile are consistent with that in terms of our customers and the time on these mother board manufacturers now beginning to buy again for product that is reflecting end-user consumption.
Operator
Your next question comes from Chris Danely – JPMorgan.
Chris Danely - JPMorgan
So you talked about your gross margin trends in the second half of the year assuming some normal seasonal patterns. Why not throw out a full year gross margin guidance and then which quarter do you expect higher incremental gross margins in, Q3 or Q4?
Stacy Smith
It’s relatively straight-forward to look at the trend of what’s happening. It’s quite difficult until we get a sense of the underlying business level to put a point around gross margin, which is why we’re not putting a point estimate out there for gross margin.
I can say with some confidence our inventory level came down dramatically in Q1. Actually I can say that with complete confidence. We can say with some confidence that the overhang of inventory in the industry has come down to normal levels. That’s allowing us start refilling our factories on a trend basis. We’re going to start seeing less excess capacity charge now continue into the second half.
In terms of where the gross margin ends up is really going to be a function of what does demand look like in the second half. And I think Paul did a great job of articulating just a lack of visibility. We have hit bottom, lots of indications of that, but still a lack of crisp variability of what does in-demand look like, particularly as we get into the second half.
Chris Danely - JPMorgan
You’re operating margins in sort of the other category went up a lot. Was that all due to NAND or was there anything else in there?
Stacy Smith
NAND did get a bit better but you should also look at our restructuring cost drop to quarter on quarter. That’s a piece of it as well.
Operator
Your next question comes from JoAnne Feeney - FTN Midwest Capital.
JoAnne Feeney - FTN Midwest Capital
I just wanted to clarify what you view as normal and why you’re saying you think things have returned to more normal seasonal patterns, so it’s just a follow-up. So you are confident that you are seeing normal seasonal patterns return but not sure to what degree perhaps. Is that the main issue that you think that in the second half we do get that uptick but we just don’t know how big it is yet and that’s why you’re being conservative about guidance?
Stacy Smith
I think you have it exactly right. Everything I have seen suggests that the industry is at a new base line. We are starting to see the normal seasonality adjusted a little bit for the inventory replenishment we talked about earlier for Q2. And then every sign we see in terms of markets recovering and here’s the time phase deal suggests that we’re likely to see typical seasonality in the second half.
You know, I talked about Europe being weak. My sense is that everything we’ve seen, Europe was like the United States except two or three months later. And so Europe is sitting today where we all were two or three months ago, which was still a bit more frozen than we are today. And our recent channel checks in Europe suggest that consumers are now starting to open their wallets for notebooks again.
JoAnne Feeney - FTN Midwest Capital
So if we are at a new base line and we’re not quite sure how high the seasonal uptick is going to be in the second half, going back to that gross margin question, so we’re at a line that is considerably lower than we were a year ago. Would it be reasonable then to expect that gross margin in the second half is more likely to end up in the lower half of that 50% to 60% range, because we are starting from a lower base line, and is that a reasonable way to think about this?
Stacy Smith
It’s all going to depend on your view of what the unit strength looks like in the second half. Again, the similar answer to Chris’ question, I can say with some confidence we’re going to see an improving gross margin as we get into the second half, based on the driver that I’ve articulated, excess capacity charges and start-up costs abating. Where it ends up in that normal range to a first approximation is going to based on the strength of the unit demand that we see in the second half.
Over time we can adjust our capacity but that’s something that is more of a 2010 issue than a 2009 issue.
JoAnne Feeney - FTN Midwest Capital
In the past you’ve talked about Atom and margins and we have all tried to understand the relative impact on gross margins to operating. Do you still feel like Atom has a greater potential to contribute to the operating margin level relative to the gross margin level. And is that something that is become more of an issue as the year progresses?
Stacy Smith
I will talk about that in some detail at the upcoming investor meeting. My view of Atom hasn’t changed and as we look at the Q1 results from an overall product margin standpoint, dollars are equivalent to what we see at the low end of our stack today. 5 margin percent is significantly better than the low end of that stack so from that perspective it chips a very healthy product margin for us. It also does a good job of leveraging investments we already make. And so I think you’re going to see it being a top line driver. I’m not expecting it to be dilutive at the gross margin level and it should drive operating profit expansion.
And I will try to share more specifics in the investor meeting so that you can see some of the data of the nine plus months we’ve been shipping the product.
Operator
Your next question comes from Kevin Cassidy - Thomas Weisel Partners.
Kevin Cassidy - Thomas Weisel Partners
Just ask a few more questions about the Atom. I guess I was surprised at the decline in revenue in the first quarter. And you say there was inventory in that book. Do you know where the inventory was geographically?
Paul Otellini
A lot of it was still in warehouses in China at the end of fourth quarter because people didn’t sell as many as they thought and a lot of the units were being sold in Asia. As I said, at this point in time, that we believe that most of this quarters activity on Atom was our customers’ selling off that overhang of inventory from Q4 and Atom was still fairly strong. Even though it was down 26% it was down from a number that had doubled from Q3 to Q4. 
So you’re still talking about a fairly strong clip and I think we would still expect netbooks as a category to be approximately 2x in 2009 versus 2008. This is still one of the hot categories out there and one of the great stories of technology this year.
Stacy Smith
It wasn’t a surprise to us, in fact I think we said it on the last call that we expected a pretty significant inventory reduction. This has to do with where the economic uncertainty hit relative to the ramp. That the channels were filling rapidly, the economic uncertainty, that inventory needed to clear out. We expected it in Q1 and we saw it in Q1.
Kevin Cassidy - Thomas Weisel Partners
Okay, maybe it’s an obvious question but any speculation of a shortage of Atoms?
Paul Otellini
These are products that we can build by the millions. Not a problem.
Operator
Your next question comes from John Barton - Cowen & Co.
John Barton - Cowen & Co.
Paul, can you provide any update on the engagement with TSMC for Atom and obviously for embedded applications. How has that progressed? Any feedback from customers, the end markets that you see people gravitating towards such an engagement in?
Paul Otellini
I can give you a little bit, not a lot. We announced that engagement about a month ago. It’s beginning with Intel doing the port of Atom over to their process technologies, take advantage of the collaterals and so forth. We announced it well ahead of the availability of the core partially, to get at your second question, was to see the level of interest that is out there. Our intent by doing this was to help move Intel architecture more aggressively into new markets.
We are not looking at this as an outsourcing of Intel factories, by any stretch. This is really an architectural play to be able to take advantage of the different customer base that TSMC as well as the I people locks and collaterals that they have in their libraries. 
And there have been a good number of interesting phone calls subsequent to that announcement, where people want to know the specifics and what can they do and how can they use this product to go into such and such market. And it’s premature to announce those but right now it looks like the strategy to put it there, in terms of widening the architectural acceptance, looks pretty good.
John Barton - Cowen & Co.
Stacy, you reiterated your view that the back half of this year is probably a 50% to 60% gross margin range. Obviously nothing has changed in your view of 32-nanometer, nothing has changed in the fact that you should have flushed through the Q4, Q1 higher cost inventory, but one of the drags, if I can call it there, on Q2 gross margins is the mix issue. You know towards consumer, away from enterprise. And I did hear some hesitancy with respect to when enterprise will rebound. Can I read into your statements that you expect enterprise to rebound by the end of the year or is it just the fact that 50% to 60% is such a range you could absorb that 2% hit and it just doesn’t matter to you.
Stacy Smith
I think I get into that range based on the abatement of excess capacity charges and start-up costs. Even if the enterprise market stays weak. Now, we could see other changes in the marketplace that could put that in jeopardy but, yeah, I don’t need a big recovery in the enterprise market. And in fact, it’s not something I’m projecting for Q2. I think the enterprise market will continue to be weak for a while.
Operator
Your final question comes from Tristan Gerra – Robert W. Baird.
Tristan Gerra – Robert W. Baird
Given the positioning of IM Flash as potentially becoming the [inaudible] NAND flash this year and the other supplier cutting capacity, does this provide you with an incentive to further invest in [inaudible] node and if you can give us a roadmap of time line in that regard.
Stacy Smith
Let me take you on a couple of different places on that. First, our strategy is unchanged. We are continuing to try to drive cost improvements based on, in general, weak market dynamics out there. We are trying to minimize incremental capacity coming on line. To that end, we have taken in conjunction with Micron that all the generation 200 mm factory offline, we did that in Q4. We are delaying the start up of the Singapore factory in order to avoid having new classy come on. So I would say this is not a change to our strategy.
What you saw in the gross margin was the impact of some of those tactical changes having a positive impact on our business. We are ramping for nanometer factories that gave us improvement in costs. We expected costs to get better but it actually got a little bit better than we thought. And frankly, the pricing environment in Q1 was a little better than we anticipated as well, and that helped gross margins be a bit better than expectations.
When I think about the year, though, I think we will continue to see good news associated with costs but I also think just based on overall weakness in the consumer marketplaces around the world, we’re going to continue to see this being a pricing-challenged environment and so you’re going to see us keep executing to our strategy of trying to drive cost improvements and efficiencies and avoiding taking new capacity on line. 
And then secondly, the strategy of trying to move as fast as possible into new form factors like SSDs, absolutely critical to our strategy. It is where we believe we can get paid better for our technology and I think we are having some success in terms of design wins in the first quarter.
Tristan Gerra – Robert W. Baird
Given the increasing bundling of base band with Atom inside netbooks, do you see having a base band architecture as strategic to our netbooks strategy going forward?
Paul Otellini
Well we certainly have plans to announce plans for WiMax into those boxes. Our customers are designing a number of netbooks with 3G in them and they are able to do that without Intel 3G silicon. At some point in time, though, as we move to system-on-chip and into smaller form factors, hand held in particular, having a 3G capability would be strategic for us.
Kevin Sellers
I just want to close by saying first of all, thank everyone for joining on the call and remind you that the quiet period for our second quarter begins at the close of business on Friday, May 29, and our second quarter earnings conference call is scheduled for July 14, 2009.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Q4 2008 Intel Corporation Earnings Call. At this time, all lines are muted.
(Operator Instructions).
I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Kevin Sellers, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Kevin Sellers
Thank you, Melanie, and welcome, everyone, to Intel's fourth quarter 2008 earnings conference call. Joining me on the call are Chief Executive Officer Paul Otellini and Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith. This call is being webcast live and a replay will be posted to our website at around 5:00 Pacific Time and will remain there for about two months.
Two quick items as we begin, first, if during this call we use any non-GAAP financial measures or references, we will post appropriate GAAP financial reconciliations to our investor website, intc.com, after the call. Second, a reminder for everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it.
And current uncertainty in global economic conditions makes it particularly difficult to predict product demand and other related matters and makes it more likely that Intel's actual results could differ materially from expectations. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could affect our results. So with that, let me now hand it over to Paul.
Paul Otellini
Thanks, Kevin. Our fourth quarter results reflect the difficult economic climate. Putting our results into perspective, this is only the second time in 20 years that our fourth quarter revenues were below the third quarter, the last being the year 2000 where revenues declined less than 1%. The pace of the revenue decline in the quarter was dramatic and resulted from reduced demand and inventory contraction across the supply chain.
While inventories in total have declined, we are assuming further reduction in Q1. The fourth quarter was a weak ending to a tremendous year of accomplishment for Intel. We launched two groundbreaking architectures with Atom and Nehalem which together strengthened our competitive position in the traditional PC marketplace and offer incremental growth opportunities in new markets in foreign factors.
We continued our focus on efficiencies and have built that mindset into our daily operations. We divested a number of non-strategic businesses and spun out others such as our NOR flash operations. We saw the scale-out of our 45-nanometer manufacturing process, and the design completion of our next generation 32-nanometer process technology. WiMAX entered commercial deployment and holds great promise of becoming a ubiquitous mobile broadband technology.
In summary, we delivered on our operational goals in nearly all elements under our control. This disciplined execution remains an important strength for us and is the centerpiece of how we plan to manage the business during this economic downturn.
Now, let me briefly discuss our priorities for managing during this environment. First, we understand the absolute need for fiscal discipline and have in place several initiatives focused on savings and modulating our investments. We have been undergoing a broad-based restructuring for the past three years and have the efficiency gene strongly ingrained into how we do business.
Our restructuring effort was not a point project, but an ongoing process focused on operating more efficiently. These programs have yielded greater than $800 million in savings in 2008, leading to cumulative savings of greater than $3 billion since we began the program in 2006. Second, we've always believed that the best way to successfully emerge from recessions is with tomorrow's products, not by standing still with today's.
We will continue our pace of investment in R&D. In 2009, we have a slate of new products and technologies coming to market that offer superior value for our customers. We remain on track for introducing our 32-nanometer process technology in the second half of this year and we will not slow down this introduction. We believe that the shift to 32-nanometers will increase our performance lead, lower our product costs and usher in a new era of high volume system-on-chip products.
Third, we will continue to invest in our growth initiatives. Atom is launched and is being well received. It is a great addition to our product portfolio in this recessionary environment in that it enables new capabilities at affordable price points and good margins. We have made good progress in the consumer electronics space with our Canmore processor.
Those of you that attended CES saw numerous designs showing the power of using the Intel architecture to bring the Internet seamlessly to the TV. We've also made solid progress in the handheld market. Our first generation product is in production with multiple customers ramping in volume. Our second generation is sampling. And our system-on-chip third generation is well into design.
We expect a number of significant design win announcements over the course of 2009. In the midst of the difficulties of the global economy, we remain optimistic about where our strategy and execution can take us. One example is our Nehalem dual processor server offering which began shipping for revenue in December.
The performance of this product is stunning and will allow our customers to offer businesses unprecedented performance while lowering their operating costs. Lastly, we have great confidence in the cash generation element of our business model and as a consequence my plan is to not reduce or eliminate our dividend. With that, let me turn the show now over to Stacy.
Stacy Smith
Thank you, Paul. The slowing of the worldwide economy resulted in a weak fourth quarter. Revenue for the fourth quarter declined 19% from the third quarter to $8.2 billion, as downstream inventory corrections attempted to keep pace with the decline in demand that occurred over the course of the quarter.
Revenue of microprocessors, excluding Atom, was significantly below seasonal patterns but average selling prices were up. Fourth quarter revenue for Atom-based microprocessors and associated chipsets was $300 million, up 50% from the third quarter. Including Atom microprocessor revenue, overall microprocessor average selling prices were flat to the third quarter.
Revenue in the Digital Enterprise Group and the Mobility Group was down due to a decline in microprocessor and chipset unit shipments. Revenue in all geographies declined sequentially and year-over-year. Gross margin of 53.1% was down 6 points from the third quarter and down 5 points from the fourth quarter of 2007.
As we responded to reductions in demand, we reduced factory loadings, which resulted in about $250 million in underutilization charges, or about a 3-point decline in gross margin from the third quarter. An additional 3-point decline came from inventory write-offs on computing-related products which were primarily demand related. Spending on R&D and MG&A was $2.6 billion, $300 million lower than the third quarter, due to lower revenue and profit related expenses and targeted spending reductions.
In the separate category for restructuring and asset impairment charges, expenses were approximately $250 million, with about $200 million related to the shutdown of 200-millimeter NAND manufacturing facilities and the Intel/Micron joint venture. We ended the year with approximately 84,000 employees, down 3% from a year ago, and down 16% from the end of 2005.
Gains/losses on equity investments and interest and other income was a net loss of $1.1 billion, higher than our outlook net loss of $50 million primarily due to a $1 billion reduction in the carrying value of the company's investments in Clearwire. The provision for taxes in the fourth quarter was at 36.6% effective tax rate, higher than the 29% previously forecasted primarily due to the inability to take the full benefit of the loss associated with impairment charges.
Total cash investments comprised of cash, short-term investments and fixed income trading assets ended the quarter at $11.5 billion, approximately $250 million lower than the third quarter. The credit quality of our fixed income investment portfolio remains high with other than temporary losses during this tough credit environment minor, at approximately $10 million in the fourth quarter. Cash flow from operations was approximately $2.6 billion. Capital spending was $1.8 billion. We paid nearly $800 million in dividends and did not repurchase stock in the quarter.
For the year, we generated approximately $11 billion in cash flow from operations, spent $5.2 billion in capital, paid over $3 billion in dividends and repurchased over $7 billion of Intel stock. As we turn now to the outlook for the first quarter and the full year, please keep in mind that unless otherwise specified the forecasts do not include the effect of any new acquisitions, divestitures or similar transactions that may be completed after January 14. I will use the midpoint of the forecast ranges when making comparisons to specific periods.
The worldwide economic situation is creating a high degree of uncertainty around demand. Therefore, we believe there is a broader than normal range of possible outcomes for the first quarter and the full year. In light of the uncertainty in the current environment, rather than provide precise ranges for typical outlook items we will provide business drivers for some items and wider than typical ranges for others. Intel is not providing a revenue outlook at this time.
For internal purposes we are currently planning our business for first quarter revenue to be in the vicinity of $7 billion. Our expectation for gross margin is that it will decline significantly in the first quarter. As we continue responding to demand signals with cuts to factory loading levels, we expect that underutilization charges will lead to an additional 8-point decline in gross margin. In addition, as we begin the ramp of 32-nanometer process technology we expect another couple of points decline in gross margin in the first quarter.
Based on our current view of the market, we expect gross margin for the first quarter will decline into the low 40s. As the quarter unfolds, changes in demand levels and pricing of products could impact inventory write-offs, mix and unit costs, and potentially create an additional several points of margin variability.
Spending for R&D and MG&A in the first quarter should be approximately $2.5 billion, down slightly from the fourth quarter. Additionally, in the separate category for restructuring and asset impairment charges, we expect expenses of approximately $160 million as we continue to improve our costs and overall efficiency. Our estimate for gains and losses from equity investments and interest and other income is a net loss of $130 million.
Looking ahead to the full year, R&D and MG&A is expected to be between $10.4 billion and $10.6 billion. This is down 6% from 2008 due to targeted spending reductions, lower spending for revenue and profit-dependent items, and the standard shift between R&D and cost of sales spending as we ramp our new 32-nanometer process technology. With the efficiencies that we have generated over the last three years and the spending reduction already achieved in the fourth quarter, we are confident that we can achieve this spending level.
For Research and Development, we plan to spend approximately $5.4 billion to develop innovative leadership products and advanced manufacturing process technology. Our expectation for capital spending is to be flat to slightly down from 2008. Our capital spending for 2009 is expected to primarily consist of investments in 32-nanometer process technology.
Depreciation for the year is forecasted to be $4.8 billion, plus or minus $100 million, up from $4.4 billion in 2008. The estimated tax rate for 2009 is 27%. Despite the unprecedented drop in demand we experienced in the fourth quarter, we entered this downturn well positioned both competitively and financially.
Our cash flow generation, strong balance sheet and the focus we have had on improving efficiency over the past three years will allow us to weather this downturn. Our restructuring and efficiency program has already resulted in run rate savings of greater than $3 billion, CapEx avoidance in excess of $1 billion, and a reduction of 20,000 employees from our peak in 2006.
While we are making selective investments to further our competitive position, like investments in R&D and 32-nanometer process technology, we are also focused on responding to the weak demand environment. We plan to take another $700 million out of spending next year. In the factories, we are aggressively reducing build plans in order to avoid putting unnecessary cost into inventory and while that will have a significant impact on our financials in the first quarter, it is the prudent response to the current environment and will benefit us when demand stabilizes.
With that, let me turn it back to Kevin for Q&A.
Kevin Sellers
Okay. Thank you, Stacy and Paul. We'll now be happy to take questions.
Just as last time, in order to allow as many of you as possible to participate in the call we'll limit each person to one question and one follow-up. Melanie will introduce each one of you and then prompt your question and then I'll ask for a follow-up, and then Melanie will introduce the next questioner. Okay, Melanie, we're ready for the first question.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator

(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Glen Yeung. Go ahead.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
Thanks. You know, I guess I first want to look at the notebook market in the fourth quarter that you just printed. It was down considerably in your numbers and yet when I think about the end market it wasn't down that much. I wonder if you could address how much of that notebook reduction you guys saw was a function of inventory decline and how much of it you think was cannibalization from netbook?
Paul Otellini
I think very little of it was cannibalization from netbook, Glen. We've done surveys now of buyers to try to triangulate on that. While there is some cannibalization, the data suggests that the vast majority of netbook sales are incremental. And by the time we get to the analyst meeting we'll share that data with you.
On the notebook side, I think what you see is that it takes longer to slow it down. Much of our desktop business is through the channel, which is a configure-to-order model. And so the channel adapts very rapidly. They have little inventories to begin with, but adapts very rapidly to demand changes, and in fact if anything our channel inventories in desktop products are a little light right now as channel sales stabilized in the second half of December.
Notebooks for the most part are assembled in China and Taiwan and then shipped, most recently in the last six months or so, on boats. So the supply line actually lengthened as people fought to save money on shipping as the air transit prices went up with the gas going up. So that all started to contract.
I think there probably was more inventory contraction in classic notebooks than in desktops as a result. We'll know a little bit more as we go into the quarter, but that seems to be the picture.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
Okay. As a follow-up, Paul, also for you, in the press recently there's been a lot of talk about Intel reducing prices and claiming that that's in response to the environment that we're in.
I know that some of those price reductions were planned long ago and maybe just your strategy on pricing in this kind of environment, if there's anything unique about it?
Paul Otellini
I think we've got a very good and competitive price stack across the board and we're getting good value for our products. If you listened to Stacy's commentary on ASP, the net ASP for the quarter was flat and the net ASP without Atom was up slightly. That says we're getting good value for our products.
What you're seeing in our price moves in the coming quarter and even over the course of the year is not anything that's reactive to external environments. It's really the continuing process of us bringing in new technology from the top, the stack, like the core i7 that was launched in November and that drives down the overall pricing, as we bring products down.
So it's more of a stack adjustment for new technology that is much more part of the day-to-day part of the business than any kind of reactive move.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
That's great. Thanks a lot.
Kevin Sellers
Thanks, Glen. Melanie, next question.
Operator
Our next question comes from David Wong. Go ahead.
David Wong - Wachovia Capital Markets
Thank you very much. A bit further on that question with regard to notebooks and desktops, the Digital Enterprise microprocessor sales were down by just about 10% sequentially, if I calculate correctly. Was there some strength in servers that helped prop up this number?
Stacy Smith
Yes, the DEG was impacted positively because the new technology we brought in helped us from a pricing standpoint and servers so you saw a little bit of an ASP increase there.
And then just a further on Paul's point, if you look across the different segments of our business, while everything is down, what you can see is those elements of the business have the longer supply chain are down more because of the inventory correction and so that, going back to Mobility Group, that's what called Mobility Group to be down a bit more.
David Wong - Wachovia Capital Markets
Great, thanks. The other thing is can you give us some idea of the pattern of 32-nanometer start-up charges in each of the next few quarters?
Stacy Smith
Sure, and if it's okay with you, why don't I do that in the context of the overall gross margin. I think that will allow me to talk about a few elements of gross margin here. What we're seeing in the first quarter is a pretty steep decline in gross margin and the drivers there are we take a fairly significant underutilization charges as we reduce the loading in the factories and we start to see start-up costs elevated as a result of 32-nanometer process technology.
Focusing on the underutilization charges for a second, what's going on in the first quarter is we have three elements that are causing us to cut back the builds in our factory aggressively. We started cutting back in the fourth quarter.
We're accelerating in the first quarter as a result of the weakened demand environment, the fact that the supply chain is contracting and taking inventory out and also the fact that as we were cutting back builds in the fourth quarter, even with that, we built a little bit of inventory and so we're going to try to bring our inventory levels down in the first quarter. So you see this pretty steep decline in factory loadings.
That piece will start to get better in Q2 and the factory loadings get back into a more normal range in the back half of the year. For start-up costs what you see is the start of start-up costs in Q1 and then consistent with the shape of the curves that we've shown you in the past, you'll see that going up a little bit in Q2. And it will start to dissipate by the time we get to the back half of the year.
Kevin Sellers
Thanks, David. Melanie, next question.
Operator
Our next question comes from John Pitzer. Go ahead.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
Yes, thanks, guys. Stacy, maybe just as a follow-on to that with a little more detail. You said about taking your inventory down in Q1, would you care to give us a sense of how much you think on a dollar basis you think you could bring down inventory given where factory loading is if you hit that kind of $7 billion internal plan for top line?
Stacy Smith
Yes, it's going to be hard to call, based on what happens to demand, but I'm pretty confident based on the aggressive actions we're taking in the factory network we'll be able to bring it directionally down and should be a meaningful number.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
I guess the second question, if I were to run normal seasonal sequentials off the $7 billion in the March quarter, you're getting revenue down over 20% year-over-year. And the OpEx number, you guys are taking it down but clearly not that much. I'm just kind of curious, are there more levers you can pull there if you don't see a snap back or are you hitting that OpEx target to try to hit some strategic things you want to get done this year?
Stacy Smith
The answer to that, to both sides of that question is, yes. I'll answer the second part first. From an investment standpoint, we're absolutely prioritizing the investment that it takes to get to 32-nanometer process technology. As Paul said in his speech, we're going to get there as fast as we possibly can. That's what gives us performance advantage, cost advantage, and allows us to get this higher level of integration of the future markets that we want to serve requires.
That's the SOCs. We're protecting that. We're protecting the R&D in products in order to refresh our product portfolio with an eye towards when this recession ends.
I think we've shown over the last few years, we've been pretty adapted focusing on our cost structure, focusing on efficiency. I think we reacted pretty quickly in the fourth quarter based on the weakness that we saw. We'll continue to drive efficiency in the Company and bring our costs down everywhere we can.
I'm pretty confident that $700 million figure relative to my view of demand, if demand ends up being much worse than that, then we go and focus and find other opportunities.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
Great. Thanks, guys.
Kevin Sellers
Thanks, John. Melanie, next question.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore. Go ahead.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Hey, Stacy, looking at that the gross margin line, if I go back to when the dot-com bubble burst the gross margin stayed no better than 51% for the better part of two years. Can you just walk us through what would be the same or different in this downturn versus that one? And what it would mean for gross margin?
Stacy Smith
Yes. I think, Ross, simplistically, the speed at which the global supply chain is taking inventory out and the speed at which we're trying to take our inventory levels down is very different than in 2001. If you remember 2001 there was an overhang of inventory, both in the industry and for semiconductor companies. It lasted for a long time.
So I'm committed and Paul's committed. We're going to bring the utilization of the factories down dramatically in Q1. Avoid putting a bunch of cost into inventory and I think that sets us up for a better gross margin profile over the course of the year.
In fact, even with a weaker view of demand, a more muted view of demand so without anticipating a big snapback in demand, I would anticipate that Q1 is the trough. And as I start increasing the loadings again in Q2, even with the increased start-up costs, I think my gross margin will go up a bit and I think its back into what I would call a healthy range by the second half. At least that's how we're planning the business today.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
You mentioned about inventory coming down. Internally, you think by a healthy amount do you think the channel inventory falls by a similar healthy amount like the fourth quarter, more or less?
Stacy Smith
Similar to the fourth quarter. If by channel you mean worldwide supply chain similar to the fourth quarter. When we say channel we talk about our specific distributor channel. That inventory actually came down dramatically in Q4. And as Paul said, if anything, it's probably a little lower than what you would expect even in this more muted demand environment.
Kevin Sellers
Thanks, Ross, appreciate it. Melanie, next question.
Operator
Our next question comes from John Barton. Go ahead.
John Barton - Cowen & Co.
Thank you very much. Paul, you commented about the strength of the Atom processor in the fourth quarter, 50% to $300 million. To the extent that you can, if the economy was normal in the fourth quarter, what would that have been and if you thought about '09 in a normal economic environment, I mean, what do you think the Tam actually is and obviously in a normal economic seasonal kind of growth profile?
Paul Otellini
The Tam for netbooks or the Tam-Tam?
John Barton - Cowen & Co.
The Tam for your portion of it, the Atom processor and the chipset.
Paul Otellini
For the PC industry?
John Barton - Cowen & Co.
That's correct.
Paul Otellini
Well, if we knew that number, we probably would be giving you guidance for Q1. I think at this point in time, our visibility is as limited as anyone's. For planning purposes, if you look back at prior years, and in these kinds of things someone referenced the '01, '02 years after the dot-com bubble burst, those years were sort of flattish in terms of units.
And so in recent memory, that's sort of the worst we've seen as an industry and even that had a U-shaped curve in it. So I think that you'd have to look at that as being a model, although there's so much different in this cycle, in terms of the inventory and the global nature of it and the non-tech nature of this economic cycle that I think that it's just difficult to predict.
John Barton - Cowen & Co.
What I'm actually asking for is if you could ignore the economic slowdown, right, and look into next year, based upon the marketing data you now have for the acceptance of the Atom, if it was a normal economic environment with all those caveats you just gave me, where do you think that market goes for '09 or would go?
Paul Otellini
That's like asking Mrs. Lincoln what the play was like. I don't know that you can have that view. I do think Atom will grow substantially year-on-year into '09. Every pattern we see from our customers and just looking at the exit rate from Q4 says that we will see a significant year-on-year growth, but the what could it have been if the world had been normal, I mean is a whole different number set and I think that's hypothetical and probably not worth talking about at this point.
John Barton - Cowen & Co.
Fair enough. I mean, as a follow-up, how do you envision competition materializing at the processor level for the netbook application as you look out over the next few years?
Paul Otellini
At CES you saw a lot of buzz around netbooks and you saw a lot of commentary from non-traditional competitors and traditional competitors about the desirability of entering that segment. Which to me validates our view that it had a high potential for growth and it was an exciting segment and that it would be attractive, in particular in this kind of economic environment.
And so, A, we have a very good lead since we sort of established this business. Our product, as near as I can tell, is by far the best on the market, not just in our own architecture but in all architectures given the costs, the benefits, the battery life and the software capability we have. So I would expect that we will do very well in the netbook market over the course of the next couple of years.
John Barton - Cowen & Co.
Thank you.
Kevin Sellers
Yes, thanks, John. Melanie, next question.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Jim Covello. Go ahead.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs
I guess I'd like to ask about the CapEx a little more detail on the flattish kind of CapEx in the really bad revenue environment. I understand the need to spend, but could you be a little more conservative. What kind of levers could you pull if you did lower the CapEx as we went throughout the year? Where would that lower CapEx come from? Thank you.
Stacy Smith
Sure, Jim. It may be useful to break the CapEx out into couple of chunks and then I can tell you how I'm thinking about those two pieces. The majority, in fact, the predominant majority of the CapEx that we will spend in 2009 is for 32-nanometer and leading edge process technology. For us, that's a very important investment stream to get there as fast as possible.
It's really capacity that will come on line, for the most part in 2010. We'll have products in production this year, but in 2010 is really when that ramps. And as you know, because you follow us, that the advantages to us of getting that kind of process leadership over everybody else is that we can extend the performance leadership of our products, we get a great cost benefit in terms of the cost per transistor, and then specific with 32-nanometer the power characteristics of that process enable us to go more aggressively at some of the adjacent markets that we're looking at.
So in this environment, we're planning to protect that investment stream. Now, that being said, we will absolutely modulate the ramp rate of the process based on the demand environment that we see. But getting the first capability on 32-nanometer is key to our strategy and we're going to get there as quickly as possible.
There's, the minority of the capital budget which is CapEx for processes that are in production today and that's why we have kind of a wider range of potential CapEx outcomes. If the market continues to deteriorate that would be a piece that we could look at and lower the peak on 45-nanometer and do some things like that.
Alternatively, if things pick up, that piece would increase a little bit although that's really not the environment we're planning for. There's those two chunks. That second piece is one you'll see us continue to modulate based on our view of demand.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs
Thank you very much.
Kevin Sellers
Thanks, Jim. Next question, Melanie.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann. Go ahead.
Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James
Thanks. Most of my questions have been answered. Just a product line question. What's the timing of the integrated graphics into the Nehalem core or core products, what's the timing for that? Is that still second half of this year?
Paul Otellini
Yes.
Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James
And that product would be called Havendale?
Paul Otellini
There's a couple of versions, one for notebooks and one for desktops. Are you asking a schedule question? We're not quite sure of your question.
Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James
Yes, the timing of the integrated so you're going from an integrated chipset solution to putting graphics on the microprocessor.
Paul Otellini
If I infer where I think you're going, Hans, you can expect volume production of Nehalem into mainstream price points for desktops and notebooks in the second half of this year in various (inaudible).
Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James
Okay. And then a follow-up in terms of the utilization rates, it's a very, very significant decline quarter-over-quarter. Has that ever happened at Intel and if so when has that happened when you're taking utilization down so quickly.
Stacy Smith
I'm always hesitant to say it's never happened, but you're right, it's absolutely significant what we're doing here and again, coming back to the elements that are impacting Q1, it's those three things I said. It's the weaker demand environment, it's the fact that we want to bring our inventory levels down to avoid putting a bunch of cost into inventory in the face of this weaker economic climate and it's the fact that the supply chain is reacting aggressively to do the same thing.
So yes, I don't know if it's never happened before but it's a steep decline and it's by strategy. We're aggressively bringing those utilization rates down. I expect that to start getting better in Q2 and utilization rates to get back into the normal range by the second half.
Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James
Great. Thank you.
Kevin Sellers
Thanks, Hans. Go ahead, Melanie.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Uche Orji. Go ahead.
Uche Orji - UBS
Thank you very much. First question, Stacy, or to Paul, within the mix of your revenues, chipsets seems to have dropped off quite sharply for both desktops and also for mobile.
To what extent is this an indicator at all, first of all can you explain what may have happened within that in the context of your revenue and how much was this a function of ramping earlier for Nehalem and then things falling off. Can you please explain that?
Paul Otellini
Sure. Let me try. It really had nothing to do with Nehalem. If you wind the clock back to our third quarter, one of the things we talked about, was that we had record all-time revenues and units in the chipset business and in fact, we talked about the fact that historically, the chipset business is a leading indicator for demand and that chipsets tend to ship into the PC ecosystem six to eight weeks before processors are mated with them in the system. And so that was one of the indicators that gave us reasonable confidence for the fourth quarter.
Obviously, the rest of the industry, people that were buying parts from us felt the same way or they wouldn't have bought the parts. And then what you saw with the dramatic erosion in demand in the fourth quarter, particularly the second half is all that inventory, basically much of it was still around. And it didn't get consumed.
In fact, there's still some out there. So the chipsets, if you will, overperformed in Q3 and significantly underperformed, but over a six-month period I think there's still a little bit of inventory there. That was really the story. To our knowledge, it's not a share loss, it's not an indicator of anything deeper than that.
Stacy Smith
Uche, it's back to my simplistic rule of thumb, which is those elements of the business that have a longer supply chain are seeing the steeper declines and those elements of the business that had less inventory out there are bottoming more quickly. If you really think about our business in that term, all of the elements make sense.
Uche Orji - UBS
That's helpful. Let me ask another question, please, Paul. Canmore, you mentioned that in your opening remarks. Not quite sure how you tend to brand those products as that expands outside of the PC market. The Intel inside program works very well for PCs. What will be the branding strategy for products outside of the PC market?
Paul Otellini
All of these system-on-chips will be members of the Atom class ultimately. I don't think you won't see a PC class branding program associated with these. But there will be programs to associate it in the minds of end users and certainly working with our customers. We think that helps identify the value of the full Internet that these products bring. It's not the kind of Intel inside program, cooperative marketing program that we run in PC space.
Uche Orji - UBS
Thank you very much.
Kevin Sellers
Thanks, Uche. Go ahead, Melanie.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Chris Danely. Go ahead.
Chris Danely - JPMorgan
Thanks, guys. If I run through the math real quick, it seems to me like you have to take out, reduce your inventory maybe $700 million, $800 million, $900 million in Q1 to get back to normal levels. Am I in the right ballpark?
Stacy Smith
I'm not going to put a quantification on it. I expect it to come down some in Q1, and then based on the shape of both demand and if the inventory, the worldwide inventory pipeline has corrected and starts to refill, it could get you to a different answer as you get to Q2.
But we're committed to keep from putting a bunch of cost into inventory and that's why you see us taking our utilizations down. If we have to continue that into the second quarter, we will. But right now the expectation of the shape of this is that we can start to reload the factories a bit in Q2 from where they are in Q1.
Chris Danely - JPMorgan
Got it. As my follow-up, you guys said you're shooting for, I guess, the normal factory loadings in the second half of the year. Assuming this is like an 01, '02 type of downturn and you guys don't get back to $8 billion in revenue until the end of 2010, how would you get your factory loadings to normal levels, looking at $7.5 billion in revenue at the end of the year on a quarterly basis?
Stacy Smith
Well, in that kind of a hypothetical situation, the levers you would see us push is we would slow the ramp rate of 32-nanometer, we would look at our older generation process technology and because we build in the ability to reuse and roll forward that equipment from 45 to 32, you would see us take some of the older generation capacity off-line and roll it forward to 32.
Those aren't actions that we can execute in a quarter, but over the course of a year or so, those are actions that we can pretty cleanly do and those would be the types of things you would see us do to get utilizations to the right level.
Chris Danely - JPMorgan
Got it. Thanks a lot.
Stacy Smith
Sure.

Our next question comes from the line of Sumit Dhanda. Go ahead.
Sumit Dhanda -Banc of America Securities
Yes, hi. Couple of questions. Stacy, your comment about the impact in Q1 from 32-nanometer start-up costs being a couple of points, roughly equates to about $150 million in the quarter.
And then the fact that it's moving up modestly into Q2 seems like we have a lower peak in place than what you might have alluded to at the analyst meeting last year. Is that accurate, first of all?
Stacy Smith
I think the shape of it is similar to what we showed you in the analyst meeting. We see elevated start-up costs in Q1. They will go up. I don't know if it's modestly or not. Maybe it's only modestly relative to the 8 points of excess capacity charges that we're taking in Q1.
But they will go up in the second quarter and then they'll start coming down in the second half of the year. Obviously, in the demand environment, we're looking at every opportunity to save those dollars, but we're also absolutely committed to get to 32-nanometer as quick as possible so we're kind of executing down both of those paths.
Sumit Dhanda -Banc of America Securities
Just to be clear, then, 2 points is about the right number to think about for Q1 in terms of the hit and then the shape of the curve is very similar to what you had indicated last year?
Stacy Smith
Yes, should be pretty similar. And, yes, you're right, it's about 2 points in Q1.
Sumit Dhanda -Banc of America Securities
Okay. My follow-up question is on flash, any sense you can give us of what the flash number looked like, is it lumped under the all other category? It seems like it might have done reasonably well. Was that related to the efforts on the SSD front?
Stacy Smith
It is in the other segment. The actions that we're taking, I think, are benefiting the business, but also say it's a challenged pricing environment in this economic climate. But we have executed on the strategy to take some of the capacity offline in conjunction with Micron so we closed down the 200-millimeter factory that was providing supply into the JV.
That helps our costs and we're getting some good early market acceptance of our SSDs and that's a better margin segment of that business. So I'd say incremental improvement, still a very pricing challenged segment of the market, given the economic climate, that shouldn't be a surprise.
Sumit Dhanda -Banc of America Securities

Our next question comes from the line of Tim Luke. Go ahead.
Tim Luke - Barclays Capital
Thanks very much. I just had a question, Paul, with respect to Atom. It looked like off the $300 million of revenue that unit wise it might be around almost 10% of the microprocessor units.
And I was wondering how you perceive the mix of Atom going forward as you maybe exit '09, and how you see that in terms of are there any sense of moderating that or accelerating it as a percentage of the mix?
Stacy Smith
I think the Q4 impact, I actually haven't done that math, I would be surprised if it's that big but I would have to go do the math. The Q4 impact gets back to my rule of thumb of you got to view the different segment of the business through the lens of supply line and inventory corrections.
And Atom was at the other end of that spectrum where there was very little inventory out there. The pipeline was filling. It probably caused it to have a better Q4 relative to some of the other segments and we're likely to see a correction in that that's coming up in the first half of the year.
Paul Otellini
And relative to the demand or the penetration in '09, Tim, what we're seeing coming out of CES is that there's new players entering this marketplace, non-traditional players. And there will be all kinds of models. There are already models, for example, in Japan where you get a netbook for one yen if you sign up to a wireless subscription.
So I think you'll see all of those people will play with those models much like they did in the early days of the cell phone and I think that it's very difficult to figure out which of those will stick and which will have preference. As I said earlier, I think the best data we've seen so far suggests that in excess of 80% of these are not cannibalizing.
They're not taking business from ours or competitive notebooks, competitive based notebooks for the most part. And as that moves into emerging markets and price points continue to come down next year, I would expect that trend to continue. So it really is a bit unbounded because you're dealing with a price point which has not existed before and that's the nature of Tam expansion.
Tim Luke - Barclays Capital
Stacy, just with respect to your earlier comment on saying that you thought you would get into a healthy range in the second half of the year on the gross margin side with a trough in the first quarter, is a healthy range back towards that low 50s or how should we think about that?
Stacy Smith
I wasn't being scientific with that. If you look across the last 10 years, you'd see that 75% or so, 30 or 40 quarterly gross margins have been between 50% and 60% so I kind of threw that out as my range. I expect based on how I'm currently viewing demand, the abatement of start-up costs and the fact that I start loading the factories at a much better level in the second half that I'm kind of back into that range.
Tim Luke - Barclays Capital
Excellent. Thank you, guys.
Kevin Sellers
Thanks, Tim. Go ahead, Melanie.

Our next question comes from the line of John Dryden. Go ahead.
John Dryden - Charter Equity Research
Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Was Asia worse than other geographies? Was that due to the change in the shipping method mentioned earlier in the call or a larger reduction in demand?
Stacy Smith
Yes, it's the same rule of thumb that I gave. Asia, Taiwan and China, in particular, are really the manufacturing hub for notebooks and for many of the other products. That's where a lot of the inventory resides. So from a billing standpoint, you're going to see that being depressed more in Q4 than the rest of the business and I frankly would expect that to continue into Q1 as the inventory correction continues.
John Dryden - Charter Equity Research
Stacy, as a follow-up, investments in non-marketable securities down $1.1 billion, was that the write-down action specifically with Clearwire or is there a mix associated with the number?
Stacy Smith
Actually, I'm not sure what you're referring to on the balance sheet. The one balance sheet account that's probably moved that much is where we would account for the dividend payable which is down about that much and then as we articulated last time on the call, we had the forward contract for the stock repurchase that we've unwound and that unwound this quarter so I think that's probably what you're talking about.
John Dryden - Charter Equity Research
Thanks for taking my questions.
Kevin Sellers
Thanks, John. Go ahead, Melanie.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy. Go ahead.
Kevin Cassidy - Thomas Weisel Partners
Thank you. In your development of the 32-nanometer products, are there certain areas or certain market segments you're targeting first, say, the Atom to be at 32-nanometer first or is it a server product?
Paul Otellini
We would typically ramp a new silicon technology with a high volume product. You get a ramp vehicle. So the most likely scenario that one would paint, I don't want to reveal all our plans now, is mobile and desktop parts, mainstream mobile and desktop parts. And then as the process picks up volume, you bring in the system-on-chips, you bring in Atom, you bring in servers.
Kevin Cassidy - Thomas Weisel Partners
Okay. And so the platform, say the Calpella platform, is on schedule for, say, an October introduction?
Paul Otellini
I really don't want to get into specific product platform things here, sorry.
Kevin Cassidy - Thomas Weisel Partners
Okay. Thank you.
Kevin Sellers
Thanks, Kevin. Go ahead, Melanie.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of David Wu. Go ahead.
David Wu - Global Crown Capital
Thank you very much. I've got a quick one. How does the OEM look to you, those customers around the world in terms of inventory of desktops and servers?
Paul Otellini
Well, to first approximation, you need to ask them, David. If I take a quick tour, as I talked about the channel inventory before, so that's in relatively good shape. The OEMs, I don't see anyone as an outlier at this point. Every one of our customers seems to be taking very aggressive action across the board to reduce the build and to not get stuck with unsold or unsalable, potentially unsalable product.
What is different this cycle is that Taiwan also took an aggressive move and part of that is the degree of outsourcing that's grown as the industry evolved from 2001 cycle to this cycle. There's much more of the industry that is now being built in China and Taiwan by those companies.
So what we saw was I think really unprecedented extraordinary hitting of the brakes very, very rapidly in the December time frame and those brakes are off a little bit right now, but they're likely to stop again around Chinese New Year. Our read of the factory networks in China and Taiwan is that many of them will shut down not just for New Year's week but potentially an extra week. Everyone is being very cautious on inventory until they get the real demand signals coming out after Chinese New Year's.
David Wu - Global Crown Capital
I see. So if I were to follow up with that, if I'm reading you folks correctly, the best guess at this point is that those inventory-related issues should be behind you by the end of Q1?
Stacy Smith
That's probably a little more precise than I would be. I think we started to see the supply chain cutting back inventory levels pretty dramatically as you got into the second half of the fourth quarter. It continues into the first quarter. I think the lion's share of it will de done by the end of the first quarter. But there absolutely could be some that continues on into the second quarter.
David Wu - Global Crown Capital
Okay, thank you.
Kevin Sellers
Yes, thanks, David. Melanie, we're going to take two more questioners, if you could, thanks.
Operator
Certainly. Our next question comes from Gus Richard. Go ahead.
Gus Richard - Piper Jaffray
Yes, thanks for taking my question. In the press release, you mentioned that you're going to reset to a new level. Is the lower level of demand a function of longer life cycles of PCs, a slower replacement cycle or is it a slowdown in the global penetration?
Paul Otellini
I think it's more the latter. I mean, I used that phrase because I didn't want to light a lantern around the snapback scenario which was really no one sees right now. I think what we're seeing in our industry, and many others around the world, demand in those industries is reset to a new level.
That means that you start growing from that level again at some point. As opposed to having a snapback and all of a sudden it's now Q2 of 19 or Q2 of 2008. I don't see that. I think we are looking at a scenario where once this stabilizes, once we find bottom, you'll start to see normal growth patterns come back into the industry.
Gus Richard - Piper Jaffray
And then just as a follow-up what do you expect to be the early, you can't tell me the depth and you can't tell me the duration, but what would be the early signs that you've reached that new level of demand? What would tell you that you've gotten there?
Paul Otellini
I think Stacy hinted at one of the broad ones, which is if our margins do as he's hinting in Q2, and Q1 is the trough, that would be principally driven by underutilization charges reversing themselves or going away in that quarter, as we started ramping up based upon demand calls from our customers. So to me, that's the thing. You have to remember, our throughput time through our fabs now is about half of what it was the last cycle. Right. It's one of our efficiencies.
So in 2001, it took us roughly a quarter from the start of a wafer to a product out the door. We're half that cycle now. So that means our response time is less than it was and it also means that customers don't have to order nearly as early.
So you have all these things compounding the cycle that make in general the industry and us more efficient in dealing with cycles like this. It also means you don't see the signs of recovery until there is real orders in people's hands.
Stacy Smith
Just simplistically, and I know I sound a little bit like a broken record, it's inventory. When you see the inventory correction done, you reset the demand levels and there's portions of our business, relatively small portions of our business that you look at and say that kind of happened in December and there's big portions of our business that the inventory correction is still ongoing. That's what will be the signal that drives the factory utilization.
Gus Richard - Piper Jaffray
Got it. That was very helpful. Thank you.
Kevin Sellers
Thanks, Gus. Go ahead, Melanie. This will be our last questioner.
Operator
Thank you. Our final question comes from Brian Piccioni. Go ahead.
Brian Piccioni - BMO Capital Markets
Thanks for taking my question. Obviously, most of the questions I had would have already been asked by now, but I was wondering, you didn't buy back stock in the quarter.
What sort of rule of thumb or policy decision you've adapted with respect to, or adopted with respect to buybacks?
Stacy Smith
Yes, thanks, Brian, it's similar to what we've articulated to you before in terms of our capital structure. We protect that dividend and Paul commented on our thinking of that going forward. We utilize buybacks as an opportunity to modulate our cash balances. What you should take from the fact that we didn't do buybacks in Q4 is we see this environment as an environment where having more cash is better.
That's why we didn't do a buyback in the fourth quarter. We don't comment on it going forward, but you can certainly read what we did in the fourth quarter and draw your conclusions.
Brian Piccioni - BMO Capital Markets
So presumably as cash generation would increase, then the buyback would be reconsidered, I guess?
Stacy Smith
We don't comment on the buyback going forward but the buyback historically has been a part of our capital structure and how we return cash to shareholders. But we didn't do any buyback in the fourth quarter.
Brian Piccioni - BMO Capital Markets
Okay. And sort of a follow-up, kind of unrelated, you've been discussing about various actions you can take with respect to utilization, so on and so forth. If the current downturn ends out to be worse than transient, shall we say, prolonged, is there much you can do to reduce the underutilization charges?
Stacy Smith
Yes. I mean, it's the similar answer to what I gave to Jim, which is over time, if our view of demand is wrong and this is much worse than we expect, so take that as the hypothetical situation, we would modulate down the ramp rate of new capital for 32-nanometer.
We take advantage of the fact that we have reusability and roll-forward capability of stuff we bought for 45-nanometers, so we'd convert that over and still get to the leading edge as fast as possible, but do it by reusing investments we've already made. That would be our strategy. Again, you can't do that in a six-month horizon, but you can certainly do that in a horizon that stretches out a year or so.
Brian Piccioni - BMO Capital Markets
Thank you.
Stacy Smith
You're welcome.
Kevin Sellers
Thanks, Brian. Melanie, just to quickly wrap up here, I want to thank everyone for joining the call and remind those on the call that our quiet period begins, for the first quarter, will begin the close of business on February 27 and that our first quarter earnings conference call is scheduled for April 14, 2009.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the third quarter 2008 Intel Corporation earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today’s conference, Mr. Kevin Sellers, Vice President of Investor Relations, Intel. Please proceed, sir. 
R. Kevin Sellers
Thank you, Amanda and welcome everyone to Intel's third quarter 2008 earnings conference call. Joining me on today’s call are Chief Executive Officer Paul Otellini and Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith. This call is being webcast live and a replay will be posted to our website at around 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time and will remain there for approximately two months. 
Paul will start with a few comments on the quarter, as well as some thoughts about the macro environment, and Stacy will follow with more detail on both our financial performance as well as our fourth quarter outlook. 
Two quick items as we begin -- first if during this call we use any non-GAAP financial measures or references, we will post appropriate GAAP financial reconciliations to our investor website, intc.com, after the call. And second, a reminder for everyone that today’s discussion does contain forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. 
So with that, let me now hand it over to Paul. 
Paul S. Otellini
Thanks, Kevin and thank you for joining our call today. Intel again delivered strong financial results, with Q3 marking the fifth consecutive quarter in record -- 
[Technical Difficulties]
R. Kevin Sellers
Amanda, we’re having feedback problems. 
Operator
I heard it. 
R. Kevin Sellers
Amanda, can you hear us? Okay, it sounds like we are back online. 
Operator
Yes, sir, you sound fine. 
R. Kevin Sellers
Thank you. We can continue then? Okay. 
Paul S. Otellini
First of all, let me apologize for that glitch. That system clearly doesn’t have Intel products in it. Let me start again. Thank you, Kevin and thank you for joining our call today. Intel again delivered strong financial results, with Q3 marking the fifth consecutive quarter of record quarterly revenue. While revenue grew 8% over the second quarter, operating income grew a healthy 37% to just over $3 billion. In Q3, we shipped an all-time record number of microprocessors, driven by strength in mobile. The Atom family is off to a very good start, with Atom microprocessor and related chipset revenues approximately $200 million this quarter. Total microprocessor ASP was lower than Q2 but was approximately flat without Atom, reflecting strength in the core business. 
Our chipset business also had record units and revenues in the quarter. Our disciplined execution is a critical strength to us. Our product lineup is extremely well positioned across the spectrum of computing. In particular, I am pleased to announce that we began shipments of our Nehalem product family during the third quarter and expect to formally launch these products in November. Nehalem brings a new micro architecture and new performance features. This new product family will further extend our performance leadership in microprocessors. 
We also continue to see strong acceptance of our Atom microprocessor family, which was designed to enable new mobile Internet form factors at attractive system price points with healthy product margins for Intel. 
I want to take a minute and reflect on a number of important actions that the company undertook in 2006 and 2007. These actions put us in an excellent operating position for changing economic conditions. 
Our current employee base is approximately 20,000 heads lower than our peak in 2006 and we have removed over $3 billion in spending. We’ve made a large number of changes in our operations that have prepared us well for a variety of economic scenarios. Our business model generates strong cash flows with Q3 operating cash flows of over $3 billion and a current cash position of approximately $12 billion. 
With very little debt, our balance sheet is in excellent condition. 
Turning to NAND -- 
[Technical Difficulties]
Paul S. Otellini
I’m assuming that you can hear me. Turning to NAND, last week Micron announced our joint decision to shut down 200-millimeter NAND operations. In addition, the IMFF planned Singapore fab is now on hold as we continue to take actions to reduce supply in light of current market conditions. 
On the product side, we launched our solid state drive product family in Q3 to outstanding reviews and are currently ramping those products, giving us a lead in the higher margin segment of the NAND business. 
Now let me speak briefly about what we see in the market today and how that has shaped our outlook. Q3 played out mostly as we expected it to when we began the quarter. We saw some softness in September in the corporate segment while consumer was more seasonal. As we head into Q4, we see some mixed signs. We expect the corporate segment to continue to show some softness as IT spending gets rationalized in this macro environment. 
Inventories in total seem in reasonable shape, with Taiwan and channel customers cutting back and some OEMs building a bit. In general, consumer traffic overall is light at this point in the quarter but we do see continued healthy interest in notebooks and netbooks. Our channel business began Q4 in good shape in terms of inventories and sales out. 
It’s clear that the financial crisis is creating some [inaudible] that may impact our business but the extent of that is difficult to quantify. As a result, we’ve made two changes for this quarter -- one, our outlook has a wider range than normal, reflecting our view of the boundaries of the risks, and two, we’ve decided to provide a formal mid-quarter update scheduled for December 4th to allow us to give you additional information about the state of Q4 business trends as the business and financial conditions unfold. 
Let me now turn the call over to Stacy for a more detailed look at our financials. 
Stacy J. Smith
Thanks, Paul. Intel had a strong third quarter. We have third quarter record revenue, operating income of over $3 billion, gross margin of 59% and operating margin of 30%, reflecting the strength of our product portfolio, process technology, manufacturing operations, and focus on efficiency. 
Revenue of $10.2 billion was up 8% from the second quarter, in line with average seasonal trends. Revenue of microprocessors excluding Atom was in line with seasonal patterns on flat average selling prices. Third quarter revenue for Atom based microprocessors and associated chipsets was approximately $200 million, including Atom microprocessor revenue, overall microprocessor average selling prices declined. 
The mobility group accounted for over 45% of total revenue. This revenue of $4.7 billion was up 23% from the second quarter, with microprocessor strength in every notebook segment. 
On a geographical basis, Asia-Pacific and Japan experienced better than seasonal revenue growth at approximately 12% each. Relative to seasonal patterns, EMEA was at the low end while the Americas lagged due to weakness in the corporate segment. 
Gross margin of 58.9% was up 3.5 points from the second quarter and up over 7.5 points from the third quarter of 2007. Versus the second quarter, a couple of points of the increase came from lower microprocessor unit costs and about a point came from microprocessor volume increases in the third quarter. Versus the midpoint of the outlook range set in July, third quarter gross margin was up nearly a point on lower-than-expected microprocessor unit costs. 
Spending on R&D and MG&A was $2.9 billion, flat to our forecasted range and flat to the second quarter. Gains losses on equity investments and interest and other income was a net loss of $265 million, higher than our outlook net loss of $30 million. Volatile conditions in the memory market segment resulted in a $250 million impairment on our investment in Numonyx. 
The provision for taxes in the third quarter was at a 29% effective tax rate, lower than the 33% previously forecasted, primarily due to a tax reorganization enabling the recognition of previously unrecognized non-U.S. losses, and a provision to return true-up related to 2007. 
Total cash investments comprised of cash, short-term investments, and fixed income trading assets ended the quarter at $11.8 billion, approximately $275 million higher than the second quarter. The credit quality of our fixed income investment portfolio remains high, with other than temporary losses during this tough credit environment minor at under $15 million in the third quarter. 
Cash flow from operations was over $3 billion. Capital spending was nearly $1.4 billion, dividend payments were nearly $800 million, and stock repurchases were $2.1 billion. As we turn now to the outlook for the fourth quarter, please keep in mind that unless otherwise specified, the forecasts do not include the effects of any new acquisitions, divestitures, or similar transactions that may be completed after October 13th. I will use the midpoint of the forecast ranges when making comparisons to specific periods. 
While our results in the third quarter were strong, and we have high confidence in the fundamentals of our business, the financial crisis is creating a high degree of uncertainty around fourth quarter demand. Therefore we believe there is a broader than normal range of possible outcomes for fourth quarter revenue, ranging from $10.1 billion to $10.9 billion. The low-end of this range is slightly down from the third quarter, while the high-end of this range is at the lower end of seasonal patterns. 
Our expectation for gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter is 59%, plus or minus a couple of points, flat to the third quarter. Spending for R&D and MG&A in the fourth quarter should be approximately $2.9 billion, flat to the third quarter. Additionally, in a separate category for restructuring and asset impairment charges, we expect expenses of approximately $250 million. $200 million of this restructuring charge is related to the shut-down of 200-millimeter NAND manufacturing facilities that are part of the Intel Micron joint venture. 
Our estimate for gains and losses from equity investments and interest and other income is a net loss of $50 million. 
Our forecast for the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter is 29%, reflecting the R&D tax credit that was recently signed into law, restoring the credit to the beginning of 2008. 
Spending for R&D and MG&A for the full year is now forecasted to be approximately $11.5 billion, down from our prior forecast of $11.7 billion, primarily due to revenue and profit dependent expenses and foreign exchange rate changes. 
Our forecast for capital expenditures has been reduced $200 million to $5 billion, plus or minus $100 million. 
Year-to-date, actual gross margin plus the midpoint of the forecast range for the fourth quarter, leads to full-year gross margin of approximately 57%, consistent with our prior forecast for an annual gross margin of 57% plus or minus a couple of points. 
While the economic outlook has deteriorated over the past quarter, our competitive position has strengthened. Our strong product portfolio continues to get better. Our manufacturing leadership maintains us at a generation ahead of competition. Our healthy cash flow generation, a strong balance sheet, and the focus we have had on improving efficiency over the past two years has put us in an outstanding position to come out of this economic downturn even stronger. 
With that, let me turn it back to Kevin for Q&A. 
R. Kevin Sellers
Okay, thanks, Stacy and Paul. Our apologies to those of you on the phone for the technical difficulties there. As we enter the Q&A section, if there is anyone that would like us to restate a portion of any scripts if they didn’t come through well, please do highlight that and we’ll be happy to do that for you. 
Amanda, we’re going to now move into questions. What we would like to do is ask each questioner to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up and I will cue Amanda to do that. And again, if you need clarification of something that didn’t come through clearly, please do let us know and we will not hold that against you as a question. We will let you keep asking the questions. 
So Amanda, we’ll now turn it over to the first questioner. 
Question-and-Answer Session

Operator
(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from the line of Uche Orji with UBS.
Uche Orji - UBS
Thank you very much. First question, Paul, if I look at it, 3Q mobile revenue, that definitely came across very strong. How much of that do you think may have been pulling in from the fourth quarter? And also, if I look at the fourth quarter guidance, of course I know there’s a wide range of outcome but ideally, fourth quarter tends to be more front-end loaded. So what could influence this outcome, given that we’ve already seen some part of October? So are we -- hopefully you can clarify that. 
Paul S. Otellini
Well, let me just correct -- for us, Q4 is not necessarily front-end loaded and you have to remember that two of our largest customers have year-ends in -- or quarter ends in January, not in December, so they tend to ship right through the quarter. 
But let me back up -- yeah, mobile was very strong in Q3 across the board, basically in all segments and I include Atom in that for the Netbook segment. To my knowledge, we’ve not seen any evidence of any pull-ins. And in fact, it wouldn’t make a lot of sense for an OEM to deliberately pull in products, to eat up expensive inventory on your assets. We have hub inventories with a lot of our major customers now, so there is no incentive for anyone to have pull-ins or ship aheads. So we really don’t see that and when I talked about inventory at the OEMs, it’s really a quite small change that we saw. 
Uche Orji - UBS
All right, that’s great. In terms of the gross margin guidance, it seems like you are managing to hold up gross margins and continue to improve it. A question for you here, Paul, is to what extent is the gross margin guidance, I know it’s plus or minus a couple of points but given that this is a very challenging macro environment, it seems like the gross margin guidance is fairly resilient. Are you -- this is definitely in many ways a reflection of Intel's clients competitive positioning but how bad can it get, really? I mean, what could influence any further weakness in gross margins? And by this I’m asking for clarification around things like 32-nanometer ramp or possibly any kind of mix change. If enterprise were to weaken further, could gross margins get even worse? You know, so just try to help me understand. 
Paul S. Otellini
Okay, let me give you a high level answer, Uche, and then Stacy can drill down but the range of revenue that we gave you is quite broad -- broader than we’ve ever done before. The range of margin that we gave you was plus or minus two points, around 59. So that range we think covers all the possible corner cases inside the revenue range that we talked about in terms of mix and those kinds of things, so we’re really pretty comfortable in that margin forecast. 
Stacy J. Smith
Yeah, I would just reinforce the range around gross margin encompasses the range that we have around revenue. I think it’s probably -- if you look Q3 gross margin, if I can just go there for a second, we anticipated a couple of points of improvement from Q2 to Q3 and we actually got three points, 3.5 points of improvement. They were in the elements that I anticipated. Part of it was mix. That was about a point, and then I got a couple of points of good news in cost as our costs get better through the different factory networks that we have. So that’s where I had good news to the forecast, was in cost and I think when I look at Q4, I’m comfortable with the gross margin guidance relative to the revenue guidance. 
Uche Orji - UBS
Going to next year on 32-nanometer, how -- 
R. Kevin Sellers
Uche, I’m going to have to cut you off. Amanda, next questioner, please. 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of John Barton with Cowen. Please proceed. 
John Barton - Cowen & Company
Thank you very much. Paul, your competitors announced their intent from a manufacturing strategy perspective. My guess is you are not going to talk about your legal strategy to deal with that but could you give us a view if indeed they do work towards this JV, how it potentially changes things from a competitive dynamic perspective in your view?
Paul S. Otellini
You’re right, I won’t comment on the legal stuff. It’s a little hard for me to comment on the structure. I think all the specifics haven’t been at least not released to us. But from my perspective, nothing has changed. You still have someone that has to invest in capital at one end of the food chain. You have to put CapEx in the ground and build factories and develop technology and then optimize that to products and get a return on that capital and then build those products and now sell it to someone else for some price who then sells it to the end customer. 
So the food chain really hasn’t changed in terms of the ecosystem except that there’s one more person perhaps looking for a return in the equation. 
Stacy J. Smith
And if I could add just competitively, we certainly believe for our business that the ability to integrate our design and manufacturing is a core asset and really leads us to be able to bring low power, low cost, you know, new feature high performance products to the marketplace. So when we look at our business, that integration of design and manufacturing is one of our core assets and the fact that we tend to be a generation plus ahead of the rest of the industry is absolutely key. 
John Barton - Cowen & Company
You talked about the strength in mobility. Obviously it’s observable in the numbers but also observable was a significant increase in the operating margins quarter on quarter, roughly 33% to 40%. Could you give us a breakdown of what drove that and probably more importantly how you think that trend is going forward?
Stacy J. Smith
I’ll answer the first part and probably not as much on the second part as you would hope but the -- inside of Q3, what you see in the mobility segment was nice revenue growth on the backs of this continued shift towards mobility. As Paul said, we had strength in every segment of the notebook market and we started to see the incremental revenue associated with Atom in there as well. So between the processors and the chipsets, we had a couple hundred million dollars worth of Atom revenue in that segment. And then on the cost side, our costs came down nicely from Q2 to Q3, so the combination of that revenue growth and the cost growth led to a nice improvement in operating margin. 
You can see that cost impact on the DEG segment also. They just didn’t have the revenue growth. 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. 
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Can you give a little idea of -- cannibalization has been a concern with Atom moving up into the notebook stack. Can you give us any idea of if you saw any of that happen; if it did happen, did it hit the notebook side or do you believe that might hit entry level desktop more?
Paul S. Otellini
Let me take that one, Ross -- almost all the shipments to date are going into netbooks versus net-tops, so it’s principally a mobile product by large, large numbers. To date we have not seen any evidence of cannibalization and believe me, we’re looking. This is something we watch very carefully. We look at where these are sold, the reasons they are sold and the price points they are sold at and one of the best pieces of evidence we have in that is the strength in the core mobile business independent of Atom is still very, very good and in these times, I think that’s a reassuring fact. 
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
In the follow-up question, on a different topic, if the macro conditions remain challenging, are there things on the capital expenditure side of things or the technology ramp that you could adjust, such as the timing of 32-nanometer? Or are those things set so far ahead that you really don’t adjust those by pulling them in or pushing them out by a quarter or two?
Stacy J. Smith
Well, it’s not a question of blindly executing to the schedule; it’s a question of process technology leadership is really the core competitive advantage. It brings us great ROI in terms of cost. It also allows us to bring new features, higher performance, lower power to the marketplace so for us, that is the game. 
You did see us reduce the capital forecast for the year. I wouldn’t want you to take from that that we are reducing ramp rate in the quarter of 45-nanometer because we are not, nor are we pushing out 32-nanometer. What we are doing is taking tactical actions to -- some of the non-capacity related capital and you are seeing a continued focus on efficiency in the factory network and that’s pretty consistent with where we’ve been the last six quarters where we just find opportunities to reduce our capital spend while we stay focused on ramping the new process technology.

Your next question comes from the line of James Covello with Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs
Good afternoon, guys. Thank you so much. Stacy, if I could stay on the CapEx issue for a second, I think in the meeting at the developer forum, you had suggested that you had squeezed almost as much of the factory efficiencies out of the system as you could have. Has that changed or do you think that you are still pretty much going to need to spend in line with unit growth and die size requirements at this point?
Stacy J. Smith
No, it hasn’t fundamentally changed. We are at levels of yield and equipment utilization inside the factories that you are not going to see the same level of improvement going forward that we’ve seen going back, so the way I described it in the meeting in May was we have reset the trend line down because we now have higher utilizations and are more efficient but as die size changes or as units grow, we will spend capital more at a trend with that. We will just do it starting from a more efficient level. 
James Covello - Goldman Sachs
That’s helpful and then if I could just ask on the 32-nanometer, especially on the start-up costs, I mean, to the extent you suggested that the 32-nanometer is still on track, the timing for the start-up cost would still hit in the first half of 2009, is that right?
Stacy J. Smith
Yeah, my view hasn’t fundamentally changed from the famous graph I showed you last May. You know, we’ll start to see start-up costs in the first half of the year and that will probably be the peak of the start-up costs associated with the new process. 
James Covello - Goldman Sachs
And is that equally Q1 and then Q2 or is it biased towards one of those quarters?
Stacy J. Smith
I’m not getting into that level of granularity. I’ll provide a lot more insight on that when we get to January and provide a gross margin forecast and everything else. 
James Covello - Goldman Sachs
Thank you very much. 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung with Citigroup. 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
Thank you. You know, I noticed that your inventories were up 4% or so in the quarter. It sounds a little bit more than normal, and you are obviously guiding for revenues that are a little bit less than normal, and yet gross margins look pretty healthy. Is there something here that has changed between you and your customers wherein you are holding more of the inventory, or is this something where we should be concerned about how utilization rates may trend looking into Q1?
Stacy J. Smith
As Paul mentioned, we have gone in some cases to situations where we’ll hold up inventory on behalf of our customers but I’d say in the scheme of things, that’s a minor impact on the overall inventory. It’s mostly what we have running through the fabs. 
When I started Q3, and I think I said on the last call I expected to build a little bit of inventory. Where we ended up in the quarter is pretty much what I would have expected. In fact, I think I’ll build a little bit more inventory in the fourth quarter as I continue to ramp the 45-nanometer factories. 
You know, obviously with the variability that we now see in demand, it’s something that we are watching really carefully but we’ll complete the ramp of 45-nanometer because of the reasons I said before -- it’s the best performing products and it brings us cost advantages. 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
Just as a follow-up, you know, when you think about 2009 compared to other years where we’ve had a down cycle, and I’m sort of making the assumption that’s what is going to happen in 2009, can you talk about structurally -- and Paul, you alluded to this at the beginning and I wonder if you’d just be more specific with respect to gross margins -- what about Intel's gross margin profile is different in 2009 from say 2004 or 2001 that may give you some better protection on gross margin, if anything?
Paul S. Otellini
Let me give you some color and then Stacy can give you the very specific answer -- 
[Technical Difficulties]
I think -- who knows what ’09 is going to be but I do think that there’s some things that look like they are different. For one thing, this is not a post dot.com kind of downturn and one of the things I recall vividly in that one was that people stopped buying computers principally because there were so many available on eBay from companies that melted down. And that skewed demand in ’99 and ’01, and ’00 and ’01 as a result. 
So I think there’s some things we have going for us. We’ve had continuous strength in emerging markets, including this last quarter. China rebounded nicely after the earthquake and again after the Olympics. China is on track to become our largest market in a reasonable amount of time, and I don’t see that changing. 
The emerging market pattern of more people coming into computing every day is different now in terms of the dynamic we have than any of those prior downturns you talked about, principally because the cost of computing has come down so much relative to their income levels. And so I think this will have a different pattern coming through it, on one end on the PC side; on the other end, there’s still a need for efficiency in the data center, a need for new servers to handle virtualization and those kinds of things. So right now, I’m of the opinion that technology will probably do well during a downturn just because of the simple fact that we sell tools of productivity. 
Stacy J. Smith
I don’t really have anything to add to that. You know, we obviously have been comfortable all year long with our forecast for gross margin for 2008 and I’m not yet going to provide a forecast for 2009 but I think the way you started the question, you are a little ahead of us in terms of your expectation for demand. Right now as we look at the fourth quarter, we need to see the impact of what’s roiling through the credit markets and that’s what is giving us the higher range of potential outcomes for revenue in the fourth quarter and we’ve got to watch that and then we’ll have a better sense for 2009. 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of [Sean Connor] with FAS.
Sean Connor - FAS
Just two quick questions -- first of all, Stacy, can you give any additional color around your expectations for ’09 CapEx?
Stacy J. Smith
No, unfortunately not at this time and not least because we want to see how Q4 plays out and I think that will give us a much better indication of 2009 from a unit growth standpoint and that will obviously have implications on our capital spending. 
The hints I’ve given so far is that we still plan to do 32-nanometer as fast as we possibly can. We get great ROI for doing that and we’ll come back in January and provide our forecast for the 2009 year. 
Sean Connor - FAS
Okay, thank you. That’s good enough. 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James.
Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James
Thanks. Most of my questions have been answered but one question on the server side -- on Dunnington, since it was introduced here fairly recently, what has the competitive dynamic been since the introduction there for that product?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, we have been doing very well with the new Xeon line over the last year or so in gaining share  and the latest tracker numbers out of IDC continue to reflect that. Dunnington just makes us more competitive. It gave us a great boost in the MP arena. You know, you can get -- these are six core machines that scale up to 16 sockets, so that’s a lot of cores and a lot of threads in there and they are pretty stunning performance, so I’m comfortable with those and then they get bumped up again as the Nehalem generation comes out in successive periods. 
Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James
And Dunnington would still hold its own against -- you know, AMD is going to introduce sooner or later this Shanghai product at 45-nanometer. Would Dunnington still do well in the very high-end of the server market?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, we’re pretty comfortable that we’ll maintain the performance leads throughout that introduction and we haven’t been able to measure anything yet from the competition but given what they said, if we just believe what they said, I think we’ll do fine. 
Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James
Okay, thanks. 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Sumit Dhanda with Banc of America.
Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America
Just a couple of questions -- Stacy, if you could give us a sense of how you expect your Atom contributions to progress into Q4? I mean, not a number but would it be up sequentially from your Q3 number? Is that where most of the growth is going to come from on a dollar basis in terms of how you incorporate in your guidance for Q4 versus Q3?
Stacy J. Smith
The second part of your question first, and I will give you a little bit more commentary on how we see Atom, but it’s just impossible to say, Sumit. It’s the issues we’ve been talking about. If you just look at Q3, you’d expect a pretty strong Q4, you know, seasonal or maybe even a little better. It was a strong quarter for us but with the issues that we’ve seen over the last few weeks, I think there’s a wide range of potential revenue outcomes so given that, it’s impossible for me to say the percent of contribution that Atom would be around an uncertain base. 
The first part of your question, between the microprocessor and the chipset, we had a couple hundred million dollars worth of revenue from Atom in the third quarter. We do expect that to grow rapidly in the fourth quarter. You know, we’re at the C part of the ramp on that. Paul talked about how this product is being positioned to drive incremental growth and then the part of this I look at is the margin characteristics and I’ll tell you what we’ve seen in the third quarter, it’s a very healthy product margin. I think it should provide some comfort to you as it does to me that with that kind of a ramp of Atom, we had 59% gross margin in Q3 and 59% in Q4. 
Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America
I know you can’t give numbers here but Paul or Stacy, if you could just give us a sense on how much the impact on the server business was because of the enterprise weakness in Q3, and are you assuming a similar level of weakness into Q4 in terms of the magnitude of sequential potentially decline into the fourth quarter?
Stacy J. Smith
Yeah, that’s a level of granularity that we wouldn’t give. It was weak in September relative to what we would normally expect and I think that’s part of a wide range of outcomes for Q4, is how does that play out? For sure the financial services industry was hit over the course of the quarter and what we are really watching for is as these credit issues play out, what does it do to the end market? So -- 
Paul S. Otellini
What I can tell you though is that financial services represent only about 15% to 18% of our server business, so even if that particular segment has continuing problems, it’s not drastic. 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
Thanks for taking my question. First question to Paul -- if you look ex-Atom, ASPs were flat sequentially in microprocessors, which is kind of a reversal of a trend we’ve seen over the last couple of quarters. Any color as to what was driving that flat ASP, and what might the outlook be going forward?
Paul S. Otellini
We won’t comment on outlook but I think if you look back, we had a very strong quarter in mobile and mobile tends to have a higher average selling price than desktop. One of the things we talked about in mobile though over the last couple of quarters is that as mobile grows, it’s inevitable that ASPs will come down. They won’t converge with desktop but they will come down because the volume price points will demand that. But I think it’s very simply a reflection of the strength in mobile this quarter. 
Stacy J. Smith
If I could just add a couple of points -- you know, if you look across the last four or five quarters, having an approximately flat ASP in the core business has really been more the rule than the exception. I think last quarter, not having Montevina probably hurt us a little bit more than we realized at the time and as it ramped, we saw stronger growth across all the segments. 
Specific to Atom, our conversations are going to be really interesting going forward because the whole point of Atom is to set new price points and bring this technology and so if we are successful with that product, you are going to see the average ASP coming down, which is why we are trying to give you the with and without Atom. But it was really interesting, now that we have a couple hundred million dollars of revenue under our belt, when I look at the product margin, it’s a nice healthy product margin and it’s on a dollar basis equivalent to what we see in Celeron and on a product margin percent, it’s higher. So if you look at it kind of relative to the low-end of our mainstream stack, it’s generating nice profit characteristics. 
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
And then for my second question, it is Atom related, can you help me understand how big the channel fill might be for Atom before we actually have to start really depending upon sell-through to continue to drive business? Clearly in the curve there’s going to be some -- 
Paul S. Otellini
We watch that at the OEMs and we watch it at the channels. We actually have reports coming in from the OEMs on sales out on those products for that very reason and we have seen zero evidence of a channel backed up on that on netbooks. They have essentially been flying off the shelves.
And I will say that we did not meet demand in Q3 for the product, even though we were up substantially from the second quarter. We are up again substantially in the fourth quarter. Our expectation is that we will meet demand by the end of the year but the early part of the quarter is not. 
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
Great, thanks, guys. 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with J.P. Morgan.
Chris Danely - J.P. Morgan
Paul, can you just take us through sort of what happened with the fall-off in demand? Has it been the last couple of weeks? You know, what are your customers telling you? Was it gradual? Do they have zero visibility for Q4? Can you just give us a little more color on what happened?
Paul S. Otellini
For Q3, we didn’t really see a fall-off on demand. We sort of did as we said we would do and the principal difference from the midpoint is NAND, where we just didn’t ship as much product. 
For Q4, the business so far has been good. What we are trying to give you though is the interpolation of what I’ll call a series of very mixed inputs. Some customers in channels are seeing little to no impact and some are worried, and as we add it all up we don’t know how much of that worry will manifest itself into reality and how much of it will dissipate, which is why we gave you a wider range. 
Beyond that, I really can’t give you much more input, beyond what I said in terms of the color on the retail sales and so forth. 
Chris Danely - J.P. Morgan
That’s fine, and then as my follow-up, it sounds like you are fairly optimistic for next year. If you had to take a guess on whether IT budgets will be up or down next year, which direction would you go?
Paul S. Otellini
Yes. 
Chris Danely - J.P. Morgan
Well spoken. 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Feeney with FTN Midwest. 
Joanne Feeney - FTN Midwest
I have a question about the characteristics of the server demand. You talked a little bit about it but perhaps you can give us a clue as to what you are seeing in the third quarter and what you expect in the fourth quarter in terms of high-end versus low-end? Are you seeing your customers shift towards lower end servers at this point or has that pattern not really changed?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, we had some pent-up demand that was satisfied in the third quarter with the introduction of Dunnington and that tended to skew the business a bit more towards the MP versus DP products. 
I think looking out into Q4, I don’t want to be too granular here but I think that DP tends to provide pretty good value and it tends to sell in places that don’t have big data centers and IT shops. So if we were to look at corporate purchases versus the rest of the world small, medium business purchases, I would imagine that DP will do better than MP this quarter but I’m just guessing at this point. 
Joanne Feeney - FTN Midwest
Okay, and then if I could, a follow-up on the capital spending issue -- so you are cutting back a bit here in the second half of the year. I guess my concern is that with AMD creating a well-funded foundry through the Arab investment, that seems like a bigger threat to me, given now how well-capitalized they are. Are you contemplating backing off of capital spending because of the over-capacity situation more broadly in the world? Or are you going to maintain your capacity plans and also your [inaudible] strategy in the face of this new potential threat on the AMD side of the world?
Paul S. Otellini
We’re not changing our strategy. Our strategy is to provide our customers with the best technology in the world and make sure that we have enough capacity to do that in the volumes that they need. And on top of that, as Stacy implied, our lowest cost position is always on the newest technology and it’s our best competitive position. 
So no, we’re not backing off and anything that’s going to be funded now is not going to be in production for some time. 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri with Merrill Lynch.
Srini Pajjuri - Merrill Lynch
Thank you. Stacy, I have a question on gross margins, a little different one -- if I look at your Q3, you did a little better and ASPs held up pretty well and you are guiding for revenue growth in Q3 and you were saying that your inventories will be up as well. So my question is why won’t the gross margins go up? Why are you guiding for flattish?
Stacy J. Smith
You’re asking from Q3 to Q4?
Srini Pajjuri - Merrill Lynch
Q3 to Q4, yeah. 
Stacy J. Smith
If you look across the elements of gross margin from Q3 to Q4, it’s one of those quarters where there’s -- you know, the elements of gross margin, there’s not a lot of variability. The mix of the company stays pretty flat. I’m not expecting a significant improvement in my manufacturing and factory costs, nor do I expect it to get worse, so it’s about flat. And when you look at the other elements, reserves and things like that, the pricing expectation is that it all stays fairly flat quarter on quarter, so it’s one of those quarters where the gross margin is flat and there’s not a lot of variability in the underlying issues. 
I think your question is could it be better than that -- I’ll refer you back to the revenue range. If revenue ends up being stronger, I think the gross margin is a bit stronger. If it ends up being at the low end of the range, gross margin is probably at the lower end of the outlook that we set. 
Srini Pajjuri - Merrill Lynch
Paul, obviously you are launching a lot of new products with Nehalem and given the macro backdrop, do you anticipate any change to the timing -- you know, if macro gets weaker, should we expect these products to launch as expected? Thank you. 
Paul S. Otellini
We would -- we are trying to pull them in as fast as possible, so no. I mean, I think having those products simply makes us even more competitive and I think they generate some demand in some segments where we haven’t been participating, so that’s one where I feel pretty good about the product line and the sooner we get to it, the better across the board. 
Srini Pajjuri - Merrill Lynch
Thank you. 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Tim Luke with Barclays Capital.
Tim Luke - Barclays Capital
I was wondering, with respect to -- as you plan to raise the inventory a little bit moving into the fourth quarter, as you build 45-nanometer, do you have a range, Stacy, of where you feel that you are trying to target in terms of days and turns for [inaudible]? Thanks. 
Stacy J. Smith
Probably not at that level of granularity and it will obviously depend a lot on what demand actually looks like in the fourth quarter. But just based on the ramp of my 45-nanometer factories, I would expect to build a little bit of inventory in the quarter. 
Tim Luke - Barclays Capital
And secondly for Paul, maybe -- you provided some sort of helpful color in terms of how you perceive broadly the end markets in terms of consumer and corporate and how you perceive Taiwan versus OEM to date -- do you have any color further there with respect to sort of regional inputs and maybe as you see OEM versus channel in the consumer arena?
Paul S. Otellini
Sure, I’ll try, Tim. I think, as I said, China continues to be a strong driver. I think we all had some worries about the third quarter, not just because of the Olympics but because of the Chengdu earthquake and it bounced back from both of those and continues to be a strong driver of demand across all segments -- in notebooks, in desktops and servers and consumer and business. So that one is a good geography for us. 
If you look at the geographies that sort of outperform seasonality for us in Q3, it was Asia-Pacific, principally China, and Japan, which is principally notebooks, where a lot of those notebooks are not necessarily consumer there but built there and exported. And the U.S. and Europe were a little slower than seasonality, which I think is consistent with the macroeconomic conditions we’ve seen in the last six to eight weeks. 
Tim Luke - Barclays Capital
And lastly just on Atom, you had a significant incremental jump from the second to the third quarter -- are you framing the same kind of range or should the acceleration be more significant from the third to the fourth as you get more availability?
Paul S. Otellini
I don’t think I want to get that granular. It’s a nice jump from Q3 to Q4. 
Tim Luke - Barclays Capital
Thank you, guys. 
R. Kevin Sellers
Amanda, we’re going to take a couple more questions, if you could, please. 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Auguste Richard with Piper Jaffray.
Auguste Richard - Piper Jaffray 
Paul, could you talk a little bit about -- you know, you’ve got a clear manufacturing lead, how you can turn that into gross margin performance? Will you ultimately move chipsets and what not into the leading edge? Or how else to drive the gross margin line?
Paul S. Otellini
Great question. I think it’s a couple of things. First, the obvious one is the faster we get to 45-nanometers across the board, the better the products and cheaper and we’re doing that. That allows us to do a couple of things -- it gets all of our chipsets then on to 65-nanometer factories, which are more efficient and cost-effective than the older in some cases eight-inch factories we still have running. So we can sort of move everything up the food chain, number one. 
Number two, as we look forward to future generations of products, we are doing much more integration on to the chip in this technology. So both the high-end products and the low-end products will have more and more integration, which allows us to take advantage of the transistor budgets that Moore’s law gives us each generation and not necessarily drive only for performance but for cost-effectiveness at the platform level, so we can integrate platform functions at the bottom into things like system on chip. And you can only do that cost effectively at 32-nanometers and above. 
Auguste Richard - Piper Jaffray 
And then just as a follow-up, do you guys run into, as you integrate the chipset and graphics, do you run into issues with having enough pins or will you have to do a multi-chip type of strategy, or is that too high a level of detail?
Paul S. Otellini
Well we are already doing -- we already know how to do multiple chips in a package and we’ve done stacking before in our cell phone businesses, so no, that’s not a form factor issue. In fact, in some of the work we are doing for [inaudible], we are now working on the X, Y, and Z heights to be able to deliver these things in something that fits in your pocket and doesn’t catch it on fire. 
R. Kevin Sellers
Amanda, we’ll take one more question, thanks. 
Operator
All right, your last question comes from the line of Cody Acree with Stifel Nicolaus. 
Cody Acree - Stifel Nicolaus 
Thanks, guys, for fitting me in here. Stacy, I think it was the last analyst day that you showed the slide breaking down the differential between gross margins, desktop server to the Atom. Now with Atom’s volumes coming in, it sounds like you are a bit more encouraged about the gross margin contribution. Would you say that that slide is a bit conservative today, especially as it -- demand seems to be pretty strong?
Stacy J. Smith
Well, that slide was a projection prior to shipping any Atom and really understanding the dynamics of the market in terms of the pricing and the cost and everything else. And you also have to keep in mind what that slide showed was second half of ’09 and it was a comparison of platform costs, so processor and chipset, comparing quad-core generation products with duo-core generation products with the Atom generation products at the time a single-core Atom generation products. 
I will update that when we get to the next investor meeting, which has now been scheduled for Q2 of next year. The point I wanted to make with my earlier comment is if we look inside the quarter where we now have significant volume of Atom, and I compare Atom relative to what a entry level mobile product would be for the notebook market, which is our Celeron brand, on a product margin dollar basis, it’s pretty equivalent and from a product margin percent basis, it’s actually better. 
So the other slide was more of an average of duo-core, average of quad-core. This is comparing Atom to the entry level of the notebook market and its very healthy profitability relative to that. 
Cody Acree - Stifel Nicolaus 
So seeing a bit of cannibalization, not necessarily a bad thing. 
Stacy J. Smith
Well, certainly our goal is that Atom is enabling these new form factors and growing the market but if there is some cannibalization and it comes from that segment of the market, it’s at a nice healthy product margin. 
Cody Acree - Stifel Nicolaus 
And then lastly, Paul I think in the beginning you talked about channel inventories, especially out of Taiwan. Do you think that the stoppage has been enough to get those inventories down to where we are ready to -- we are ready for whatever the holidays are going to bring?
Stacy J. Smith
Well, you mixed two things in that sentence. When I talked about channel inventories, I meant our distributor channels and Taiwan is Taiwan, but I think if you go back to one of the earlier comments I made about our chipset business in Q3, it was record revenue and record unit volumes in the third quarter. Chipsets always lead computers. They go into Taiwan, they soldered on motherboards and eventually a microprocessor finds its way to those and it becomes a computer some six to eight weeks later. So I think what you are seeing is a reflection of chipset purchases for a fourth quarter that may have been a little bit more robust than people had thought and now they are just kind of tightening that down to where the reality of production is. I don’t really see anything unnatural with this at all. 
Cody Acree - Stifel Nicolaus 
Great. Thanks, guys. 
R. Kevin Sellers
Thanks, Cody. Amanda, I’ll just close here -- I want to thank everyone for joining our call today. As a reminder, our quiet period for the fourth quarter will begin at the close of business on November 28th until December 4th when we will have our mid-quarter update, as Paul mentioned.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the second quarter 2008 Intel Corporation earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today’s conference, Mr. Kevin Sellers, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir. 
R. Kevin Sellers
Thank you and welcome everyone to Intel's Q2 2008 earnings conference call. Joining me on today’s call are Chief Executive Officer Paul Otellini and Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith. This call is being webcast live and a replay will be posted to our website at approximately 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time and will remain there for approximately two months. 
As usual, Paul will be discussing the highlights and progress of the quarter and Stacy will then provide details of our financial performance in Q2 as well as the outlook for both the third quarter and full year 2008. Following Stacy’s comments, we’ll be happy to take questions. 
A few important items before we begin; first, the press release of our earnings went out at approximately 1:15 Pacific Time and is now posted on our investor website, intc.com, along with updated financial statements for anyone who still needs access to that information. 
Also, if during this call we use any non-GAAP financial measures or references, we will put the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliations to our investor website. 
As we begin, let me remind everyone that today’s discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. 
So with that, let me now hand it over to Paul. 
Paul S. Otellini
Thanks, Kevin. Our second quarter results were very positive on a number of fronts. First, revenue for the quarter was a record, the fourth quarter in a row that we achieved such a result. Demand for our leading edge computing products around the world continues to be strong, with revenue and unit shipments toward the high end of the seasonal norm, when factoring in the divestiture of the NOR business. We realized record unit shipments in mobile microprocessors, chipsets and wireless communication units in the second quarter. Our focus on lowering costs and improving efficiency continues to provide considerable operating leverage, with operating income growing 67% from a year ago. 
For the second quarter in a row, we bought back $2.5 billion worth of stock, returning cash to our stockholders. 
Our 45-nanometer manufacturing process is performing superbly. We remain on track to ship over 100 million units before the end of the year on this process technology. At this stage of our process ramp, yields and throughput times are better then at the same time on our 65-nanometer ramp. These results are lowering unit costs ahead of our original plans and are providing us with increased flexibility in meeting diverse customer requirements.  
We will reach the 45-nanometer shipment crossover point for microprocessors during this, the third quarter. 
Now let me briefly discuss a few product highlights. In servers we had record channel shipments. This demonstrates the demand for our products coming from small and medium businesses around the world continues to be healthy. We also enjoyed some noteworthy design wins at both Cray and DreamWorks, reflecting that our current and future product roadmaps are delivering the performance that meets the most demanding customer requirements. 
In mobile, we enjoyed very strong unit growth, both sequentially and year over year. As notebook computers continue to decline in price, we see demand growing in response. We saw notebook unit shipments cross over desktop in the overall client PC category in the second quarter. That’s sooner than we had expected. 
We launched our new Atom processor during the second quarter and are exceeding our ramp targets as demand for this new product is very robust. We expect unit shipments of Atom processors to grow sharply in the second half. 
In summary, we were very pleased with our second quarter results. The strategic direction we laid out two years ago at our investor meeting coupled with our restructuring efforts are coming together and yielding tangible results that we committed to our stockholders. Our product line is superbly positioned. Our new growth initiatives are ramping and showing promise, and our manufacturing execution is outstanding. 
In the third quarter we plan to bring exciting new products to market, such as our new Centrino 2 platform launched just yesterday, as well as Dunnington, our six-core server processor targeted at high-end server workloads scheduled to launch later this quarter. 
These are the kinds of innovations that create real differentiation for our customers and allow us to maintain product leadership. 
A final word on the economic environment; we are very aware of the global economic issues that dominate the financial markets these days. We are watching these very carefully. In the first-half of 2008, we saw order patterns play out as anticipated at the beginning of the year. Inventories remain at healthy levels and our global footprint is helping us benefit from demand for internet computing. As we look into the third quarter, we see continued healthy demand for our products leading us to the third quarter outlook that we provided. 
Let me now turn this call over to Stacy. 
Stacy J. Smith
Thanks, Paul. Intel delivered strong financial results in the second quarter. Better-than-expected demand in the microprocessor and chipset businesses led to record second quarter revenue of $9.5 billion. Compared to the second quarter of 2007, revenue grew 9%, with gross margin up more than eight points. Operating profit was up 67% year over year and operating income as a percentage of revenue was up eight points year over year to 24%. 
Revenue for the second quarter was above the midpoint of the range forecasted in April and down 2% from the first quarter. Excluding the revenue associated with the NOR business, revenue was flat to the first quarter at the high-end of the seasonal range. Microprocessor unit sales were above the seasonal pattern and average selling prices were lower. 
More than half of total revenue, $5.4 billion, came from the Digital Enterprise Group. Revenue from this group was flat compared to the first quarter and up 11% from the prior year. Microprocessor revenue in the Digital Enterprise Group showed particular strength, with revenue up 14% from the second quarter of 2007. The Mobility Group accounted for more than a third of total revenue. This revenue of $3.8 billion was up 3% from the first quarter and up 15% from the prior year. 
Looking at a geographical breakout, all geographies experienced year-over-year growth in the second quarter. After adjusting for the impact of the NOR Flash divesture and supply agreement with Numonyx, all geographies performed a little better than average seasonality. 
Gross margin dollars were $5.2 billion, flat compared to the first quarter. 
Gross margin percentage of 55.4% was up over one-and-a-half points from the first quarter and up over eight points from the second quarter of 2007. Versus the midpoint of the outlook range set in April, second quarter gross margin was down half-a-point. A little less than a point decline came from average selling prices being lower, primarily due to the growth in shipments and the lower-priced segments of the notebook market. 
R&D and MG&A were approximately $2.9 billion, within the forecasted range of $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion and up 3% from the first quarter. In addition, we had restructuring and asset impairment charges of $96 million, which was lower than the outlook that we provided of approximately $250 million as an assessment of capacity resulted in less restructuring and asset impairment charges. 
The number of employees is down by 2,700 from the first quarter to below 82,000, primarily due to employees transferred to Numonyx. As we complete the second year of the restructuring program announced in 2006, the number of employees is down more than 20,000 from the second quarter of 2006. 
Gains, losses on equity investments, and interest and other income of $58 million was lower than our outlook of $75 million and lower than the first quarter of $109 million. Relative to the first quarter, improvements in the trading asset portfolio were offset by lower interest income and impairments of marketable equity securities. 
The provision for taxes in the second quarter was at a 31% effective tax rate, lower than the 33% previously forecasted due to tax settlements. 
On the balance sheet, total inventories were flat to the first quarter at $3.3 billion. 
Total cash investments comprised of cash, short-term investments, and fixed income trading assets, ended the quarter at $11.5 billion, $1.7 billion less than the first quarter. 
Cash flow from operations was over $2.5 billion. 
Capital spending was $1.2 billion, dividend payments were $800 million, and stock repurchases were $2.5 billion. 
As we turn now to the outlook for the third quarter, please keep in mind, unless otherwise specified, the forecasts do not include the effects of any new acquisitions, divestitures, or similar transactions that may be completed after July 14th. 
I will use the midpoint of the forecast ranges when making comparisons to specific periods. 
We are planning for revenue to be between $10 billion and $10.6 billion. The midpoint of this range would be an increase of 9% from the second quarter. On a year-to-year basis, the outlook anticipates revenue growth of 2%. Excluding the decline in NOR revenue, the growth would be approximately 6% year over year.
Our expectation for gross margin percentage in the third quarter is 58%, plus or minus a couple of points, 2.5 points higher than the second quarter as microprocessor unit volume increases in the seasonally up third quarter and as unit costs decline on 45-nanometer products. 
Looking beyond the third quarter as volume increases and costs decline, we expect gross margin to improve further in the fourth quarter. 
Spending for R&D and MG&A in the third quarter should be approximately $2.9 billion. 
Additionally, in a separate category for restructuring and asset impairment charges, we expect expenses of approximately $60 million. 
Depreciation is forecasted to be approximately $1.1 billion. 
Our estimate for gains and losses from equity investments and interest and other income is a net loss of $30 million. 
We maintain the midpoint of our outlook for gross margin for the full year at 57% and have narrowed the outlook range to plus or minus a couple of points. 
Spending for R&D and MG&A for the full year is now forecasted to be approximately $11.7 billion. R&D spending is forecasted to be approximately $6 billion, flat to the prior forecast, and MG&A spending is forecasted to be approximately $5.7 billion, up $200 million from the prior forecast, primarily due to legal and profit dependent expenses. 
The tax rate for each of the remaining quarters in the year is expected to be 33%, unchanged from our prior outlook. 
Second quarter revenue growth of 9% and operating profit growth of 67% year over year marks the end of a strong first-half. As we look into the second-half of the year, we are planning for growth and improving financial results, driven by our product leadership, the ramp of the Atom processor, the build-out of three 45-nanometer high volume factories, declining unit costs, and the impact of our restructuring program.
With that, let me turn it back to Kevin for Q&A.
R. Kevin Sellers
Okay, thanks, Stacy and Paul. Before we begin our Q&A segment, I want to remind the financial community of our upcoming Intel developer forum taking place on August 19th through the 21st in San Francisco. 
There will be seven keynotes during the forum, covering a wide range of technology trends and Intel product plans from the digital enterprise to mobility to software. We will also hold a number of briefings for investors and analysts as well. For registration and other information, please go to intel.com/idf. 
We will now be happy to take your questions. In order to allow more of you to participate on this call, we will limit each person to one question and one follow-up, if you have one. The operator will introduce you and -- will introduce each of you and prompt your question. I will then ask if you have a follow-up. The operator will then introduce the next questioner. We’re now ready for our first question.
Question-and-Answer Session

Operator
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Mr. John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please proceed. 
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
Yes, thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Guys, just quickly on gross margins for the June quarter being below midpoint, you are kind of pointing to the low-end notebook market. Was that all Atom driven or were you still selling some Celeron to that market? And if it was all Atom, how do we get comfortable about gross margin progression in September as Atom ramps and becomes an even bigger percentage of the overall mix? 
Stacy J. Smith
Yeah, it was not Atom. Atom launched in the second quarter but the units shipped on Atom were pretty small in the second quarter. We expect it to ramp rapidly into the second-half of the year. It was what I would call the traditional notebook market, as Paul said, as that is now more than 50% of the market we’re seeing a lot of unit growth in emerging markets. We’re seeing growth in channels such as the retail channels. That growth is good for us but it tends to be at a lower price point. So you are seeing TAM expansion at some of these lower price points and that brought the average price down in the second quarter from what we expected.
R. Kevin Sellers
John, do you have something else?
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
Yes, just real quick, guys -- just given the buy-backs through the first-half of the year, what can we expect in the back-half? You guys are going at a pretty significant clip relative to what you did in 2006 and 2007. What’s the philosophy there?
Stacy J. Smith
I had said back in Q1 that the cash balance was a little higher than we were targeting. We brought down the cash balance by about $3 billion over the course of the first-half and we’ve done about - we’ve done $5 billion worth of buy-backs between Q1 and Q2. Cash balance is getting more into the range of what I'm targeting. At this point, I'm not going to give a buy-back forecast, nor am I going to give a cash forecast for Q3.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
Thanks, guys. 
R. Kevin Sellers
Thanks, John. Next question. 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Tim Luke with Lehman Brothers. Please proceed.
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers

Thanks so much. Stacy, just in guiding a fairly solid revenue outlook in the 10 to 10.6, could you give us some framework for how you perceive the desktop area to be proceeding? Again, it sounds like you are expecting a fairly robust notebook and perhaps even, as on the lower-end notebook forecast, could you give us some color on desktop, notebook, server?
Stacy J. Smith
Yeah, I guess I would point back to what we’ve seen so far in the first-half. We really have seen demand holding up across the different segments of the computing-related business, with particular strength in the notebook growth that we spoke about at some of these price points. 
And then in the server market, I think the strength of our product line really benefited us in Q1. Q2 tends to be a seasonally lower quarter for servers but I would expect that to also be strong as we get into the second-half. 
I think underlying your question is demand. We saw demand pretty normal through the second quarter across the segments of our business and across the different geographies.
R. Kevin Sellers
Tim, do you have a follow-up?
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
Just as a follow-up, obviously you are holding the gross margin for the full year guidance and guiding it up fairly meaningfully in the third quarter to the 58% range. Could you just provide a little bit more color on what gets you there, given the strength you are seeing in the lower end notebook segment and the mix there? Thanks. 
Stacy J. Smith
Sure. It’s a -- it’s a pretty simple margin reconciliation going from Q2 to Q3. There are two elements that are worth roughly the same amount of gross margin improvement. We see our costs improve quarter on quarter pretty dramatically as we go from Q2 to Q3, and then we see volume in the CPU segment up seasonally, and those two things get you to 58%. 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung with Citigroup. Please proceed.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
Thanks. A question about the outlook for revenues; it’s good in Q2. You’re guiding strongly in Q3. To what extent is your confidence being helped by share gain and/or the Montevina launch? Does that give you some confidence in how you look at Q3?
Paul S. Otellini
Glen, I think it’s a combination of things. You know, what we’ve seen from our customers is -- I think the overarching comment is on the notebook market accelerating around the globe at multiple price points. We also expect and we’ll see more of Atom-based notebooks in the third and fourth quarters, and that is why we’ll continue to -- we will break those numbers out for you in our commentary so that you can draw some trend lines around those. But in general we were able to cover the shipment shortfall on Montevina in Q2 with Santa Rosa. We replaced all that volume so our customers were able to keep on shipping, and now Montevina is ramping very rapidly in the consumer segments that were launched today or yesterday.
I won’t comment on share gain but -- you know, we’ll let the numbers speak for themselves when they all come out but it has to be pretty clear that with the kind of mobile volumes we had in the second quarter that we did pretty well.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
Okay, thanks. 
R. Kevin Sellers
Glen, you had something as a follow-up? 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
Yeah, I guess maybe just going on from that response, you talked about the low-end of the notebook market sort of taking some mix in Q2, but now you’ve got Montevina coming forward for you in Q3. Does that sort of stem the shift towards low-end or do you think it’s really more a function of emerging markets versus Western markets?
Paul S. Otellini
I think it’s a bunch of things and a lot of this is dependent on the economy. You know, the prime purchaser of notebooks still remains as a segment business, large enterprise, and they tend to buy relatively high-end notebooks and Montevina will start shipping into that segment later this quarter when we launch the Centrino 2 Pro product line. So that is one that we’ve got fairly -- we’re fairly bullish about for the second half as that ramps and replaces the pre-existing SKUs that are out there. 
But in general, I think what we are seeing is just a fundamental shift to notebooks. We’ve been seeing it for years and you know, the crossover happened six months sooner than we thought. 
R. Kevin Sellers
Glen, thanks. We’ll take our next questioner. 

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Excuse me, I have a bit of a cold here, but you talked about the pricing on the notebook side of the market. Can you tell a little bit about what’s going on in pricing in desktops and servers, please?
Paul S. Otellini
Sure. We aren’t going to give you any ASP granularity in each of those areas but in servers, we had a very strong Q1 in MP and in Q2, DP was a bit more -- a bit heavier, so that tends to drive the mix a little bit to the lower priced numbers. I would expect MP to pick up in the second-half of the year, as is traditional. The fourth quarter is normally the big server quarter but as you can tell, we are being a little bit cautious about that given the overall economic environment.
In terms of desktop, there’s two trends. There’s a continuing trend in emerging markets of lower-priced desktops but there is also a trend for refresh rates in corporate around our vPro product line, which have above average selling prices, so the combination of the two has kept the desktop pricing on average relatively constant.
R. Kevin Sellers
Ross, you had something else?
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Yeah, just really quick on the ESO line -- it seems like year over year, your headcount is down a lot but the stock comp expense keeps going up. Can you give us a little bit of the background as to why that would happen and what your expectations are for that line going forward?
Stacy J. Smith
I think as we run the model -- I’d actually have to go back and double-check this, Ross, but I think it’s as we run the model, as volatility goes up a bit, the stock option expense goes up a bit. You’re right -- we have quite a few fewer employees and we have not expanded the stock option program in terms of number of options granted per employee, so I think it’s just the volatility.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Thank you. 
R. Kevin Sellers
Thanks, Ross. We’ll take our next questioner. 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mr. James Covello with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. 
James Covello - Goldman Sachs

Good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much. First question; Paul, last quarter you gave us a little bit of color about the NAND business and your thoughts around either fixing it or -- fixing it one way or the other. I wonder if you could update us on where we are there?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, I won’t give you a lot more color than I gave you last quarter, James, but we are taking some actions to limit the amount of supply growth in this environment. As you know, the NAND pricing continues to still be very weak, so we’re focusing on supply and on costs. At the same time, we are focused on trying to get a better pricing environment for our products by shifting some of it to more innovative stacking products into SoCs. At the same time we’re doing that, we’re still looking for longer term solutions. I have not wavered in my commitment to have this business not be a long-term drag on our P&L.
R. Kevin Sellers
Jim, you had something else?
James Covello - Goldman Sachs

Yeah, if I could just follow-up; on the DreamWorks win, could you just help us understand in the competitive situation there, was that your products versus AMD’s old products before they introduced say the new Barcelona chip, or was that decision made before AMD was able to ramp the new chip?
Paul S. Otellini
It was based upon our roadmap going forward versus their assessment of competitive roadmaps going forward. They don’t make a one -- they don’t make a one-quarter or even a one-year decision because the tremendous amount of the effort here is involved in software optimization, and the software optimization around Intel is relatively unique versus other vendors’ products. 
So I consider this a multi-year win; it’s a multi-year framework that binds it together. It’s software and hardware and it is I think reflective of the very competitive roadmap we have, not just in servers but also in workstations as Larrabee comes on.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs

Terrific. Thank you so much. 
R. Kevin Sellers
Thanks, Jim. Next question, please. 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Sumit Dhanda. Please proceed. 
Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America

Yes, hi. First question for Stacy; Stacy, you noted that part of the -- call it the small miss on gross margins was because of one point incremental drag from lower ASPs. Was that incremental to your expectations? Because my recollection is a couple of one-timers were disappearing your inventory reserves on chipsets, NOR flash was obviously contributing to better margins and you did have a better unit cost structure into the quarter, so I was just curious about that.
Stacy J. Smith
Yes, it was slightly less than a point and it was to the outlook that I set. If you look at this from a quarter-on-quarter basis, with the exception of the ASP, we got the good news from the two areas I was expecting. We had articulated we have some good news as we had chipsets that qualified for sale in the quarter and we were shipping them in the second quarter, so we got good news there. And we got good news from the NOR divestiture. The piece that was unexpected to the outlook was being a little bit down in ASP.
R. Kevin Sellers
Sumit, any follow-up?
Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America

I just have one, a separate follow-up. On Atom, you know, there’s been talk about constraints with respect to supplying the existing demand. Could you update us on what your sense is versus market expectations on your supply? And is that constraining your outlook for Q3 in any way, shape or form? 
Paul S. Otellini
The short answer is no, it’s not constraining our outlook for Q3. It is well within the bounds of the 10 to 10.6 that we gave you. We have been increasing our production, planned production of Atom for this year and next every 40 days since the beginning of --actually, since last November as demand continues to roll up, and not just in NetBook segments but also in embedded and consumer electronics segments. It looks like the design wins are really quite robust. 
And so we continue to add more and more zeroes to the numbers we are building for this year and next year. I don’t expect it to be any kind of limiter for revenue growth this year at all.
Stacy J. Smith
Sumit, if I can just add on that -- the supply constraints we’re seeing with Atom are specifically the back-end, the test constraints and things. We have plenty of die and as Paul said, it’s well contained inside the revenue guidance we gave. But as demand is going up kind of month by month, we’re jumping to keep enough test capacity in place for the demand we see.
Paul S. Otellini
And then the other part of that, Sumit, is to make sure we have enough chipsets. I mean, at the same time the Atom processor growth is jumping up, we have to also be able to build a chipset for each of those, which is one of the reasons you saw our factory utilization assessment go up over time in this quarter, rather than down.
R. Kevin Sellers
Thanks, Sumit. Next question, please.  
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mr. David Wong with Wachovia. Please proceed.
David Wong - Wachovia

Thank you very much. Following up from the earlier question, as the Atom ramps in volume over the next two quarters, presumably primarily for notebooks, is the Atom below gross -- is the Atom gross margin below, above, or roughly equal to overall corporate gross margin?
Stacy J. Smith
Just to make sure it’s clear, I think it is, but to make sure it’s clear; the ramp of Atom’s encompassed in a 58% gross margin in Q3 and what I expect to be a higher gross margin in Q4. My view of Atom hasn’t changed from what I showed at the analyst meeting. If you’ll recall, I was showing the Atom platform -- I used end of 2009 as the comparison point because at that point, we had ramped Atom volume, we had ramped quad-core volume to be a fairly significant percent of the total, and what I showed you at the time was inclusive of the chipset, so the CPU plus the chipset. I expected the Atom platform to be about 10 product margin points lower than the mainstream of the product line, which was dual-core, and quad-core to be about 10 product margin points higher than that. So my view hasn’t changed and I’ll update that again in Q1 next year when we have the investor meeting.
R. Kevin Sellers
David, do you have anything else?
David Wong - Wachovia

Great, yeah, one other thing -- did the MP server processors, and specifically Tigerton, processor shipments grow sequentially in June?
Paul S. Otellini
I don’t think I want to give you that granularity. The Tigerton -- it probably did, I don’t have the number at the tip of my fingers but given that it was -- it’s a relatively new product, it continues to ramp. What I was talking about earlier was the mix between MP and DP and that was encompassing both old and new products.
David Wong - Wachovia

Great, thanks.
R. Kevin Sellers
Thanks, David. Next question, please. 

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Uche Orji with UBS New York. Please proceed.
Uche Orji - UBS

Yes, thank you very much. Paul, just a quick question on Atom -- what is the relative gross margin of Atom versus Celeron? And as we ramp this product in the second-half, do you see this possibly replacing the low-end Celeron products in notebooks? And if so, what will the impact be on the net gross margins?
Paul S. Otellini
Let me answer the second part of that and I’ll throw it back to Stacy for the first part, which I think he’s already answered but he can try it again. At this point in time, we do not see it replacing Celeron. If you look at the products that are being built, the NetBook products that are being built around Atom, they are all lower priced, lower features, smaller screen size notebooks aimed at first-time buyers or the second, third or fourth machine in a household and I don’t see it cannibalizing, at least in terms of current sales out, and I think we really have hit on a new product category here.
Over time, we’re still sorting out the brand activity in our mainstream notebooks. It is clearly Centrino and Core is where the thrust is going to be, and we’re trying to -- we will sort out and ultimately talk about where Pentium-based notebooks and Celeron-based notebooks live as these categories sort themselves out. But I think it’s premature to say that, except that we don’t see any cannibalization.
Stacy J. Smith
Uche, unfortunately I’m not going to go into any more granularity than I did at the last analyst meeting. We expect this to be a very healthy product margin product. What we are seeing today is demand that’s exceeding our expectations and it’s kind of all in to my gross margin forecast for the year and for Q3.
R. Kevin Sellers
Uche, do you have anything else?
Uche Orji - UBS

Yes, I do actually and let me just circle back a little bit to Montevina. We saw a slight push-out. Obviously that doesn’t -- shouldn’t have impacted this quarter but is it possible, however, that in terms of the back-to-school build, that we may have missed, you may have missed some business as a consequence from Montevina? And is that that something you would hope to recapture in Q3, hence the gross margin impact that we see remaining strong? 
I mean, I just wanted to first of all understand, and maybe you can also help us fully understand what really happened with that push-out? I understand it was something to do with the radial. If it’s possible to clarify that, that would be helpful. Thanks. 
Paul S. Otellini
Well, the principal reason was graphics and integrated graphics and then the radial as well, but the combination of those two was about a 30-day slip on the consumer SKUs. 
A couple things on back-to-school -- first of all, as the industry has gotten more efficient over the last few years, particularly in notebook manufacturing, the cycle times have come down both from a transit standpoint and an assembly standpoint, and our customers are all using hubs and so forth nowadays as manufacturing techniques. So the amount of -- the earliness that you used to see in shipping semiconductors into manufacturers to hit something like back-to-school weekends is a lot shorter than it used to be. 
As a result, I don’t think we missed much, if any, of the back-to-school cycle. Number one, some of our customers are doing multiple SKUs and will have multiple back-to-school refreshes and Montevina will be prominent in those second rounds. And I think the goodness of the product stands for itself. There are still not really benchmarks coming out on our new products versus competition’s new products, but when they come out, given our testing internally, I expect we will do very, very well.
Uche Orji - UBS

Thank you very much. 
R. Kevin Sellers
Yeah, I appreciate that. Next caller, please. 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed.
Chris Danely - J.P. Morgan

Thanks, guys. I guess just a question or a curiosity on the ASP trends in laptops. It seems that the emerging markets are what drove the downward trend in ASPs but it seems to me that emerging markets have always been the big driver there, so I guess I’m wondering why now would it cause this sudden downward trend in ASPs and why wouldn’t that continue?
Paul S. Otellini
I didn’t say emerging market. If we did, I misspoke. What I -- what’s happening in the notebook business, and we showed this graphically at the analyst meeting, is that consumer purchases of notebooks as a percent of consumer PC purchases has grown from 15%, 20% up to 50%-ish, which is roughly where corporate is. Corporate is a little bit higher than that. So what’s happened is the consumer market on a worldwide basis and for PCs is shifting to notebooks. And consumer price points on notebooks are lower than consumer price -- than enterprise price points on notebooks because of the typical configurations and the builds behind them. So I think it’s nothing more than price/volume expansion of the consumer portion of the business on a worldwide basis. 
As NetBooks ramp up in the second-half of this year, those I do expect to be predominantly focused on emerging markets but we are just seeing the beginning of that now.
Chris Danely - J.P. Morgan

Okay, thanks. And so Paul, why wouldn’t that continue or why wouldn’t you still have ASP pressure going forward?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, that’s why we’re going to give you some color on Atom over time as a separate line item because I don’t want it to, if you will, color the overall ASP of the core business. So we’ll give you some guidance on that as it gets to be a big number.
Chris Danely - J.P. Morgan

Okay, thanks and I guess for my follow-up, Paul, could you just give us your sense on demand out there? I mean, we all read the papers and stuff like that. It seems like we all understand what is going on in the U.S. What are you seeing in particular out there in China as far as demand goes?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, specifically in China, the quarter had an early interruption, obviously, with the Chengdu earthquake and Intel and virtually everyone that I know that operates in China had some impact early in the quarter from the disruption of sales for essentially a big part of the country, the western part of the country. But having -- and that notwithstanding, the other trends in China are very good. Olympics build-up has got a lot of excitement. There’s WiMAX trials on notebooks in China for the yachting events and a lot of excitement around that. So I would expect that as the replacement machines and rebuilding schools and so forth happen in China, that there will be some recovery from the demand that was lost earlier this quarter.
R. Kevin Sellers
All right, thanks, Chris. We’ll go to our next caller, please. 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James. Please proceed.
Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James

Thanks. Paul, can you explain what the direction is going forward in terms of chipset support by third parties? Historically, there used to be various players like Avia, Asus, and ATI, and even NVIDIA. Now that some of those guys can’t do that for lots of reasons, what is the strategy going forward?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, our overall strategy on chipsets is to continue to build the best in the world and to drive as high a percentage of our microprocessors with chipsets as the market demands. And we’ve done exceptionally well in notebooks and have historically done well in servers and okay in desktop. A lot of the companies you talked about in your litany there were desktop suppliers, low-end desktop suppliers in particular and they have made economic decisions to not participate in that marketplace.
There are some structural changes coming up in terms of the kinds of busses that we’ll expose publicly with the Nehalem generation. Much has been written about that. You’ll see more about that at IDF but I was very pleased to see this week that NVidia announced they will do SLI support for Nehalem using the PCI Express bus, which is an open and non-proprietary bus. 
R. Kevin Sellers
Do you have a follow-up, Hans?
Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James

Yes -- can you remind us in terms of the tick-tock hit that you get in terms of gross margins when you ramp early next year the 32-nanometer node in terms of what’s the usual or kind of the gross margin hit in terms of points that you would expect because of that?
Stacy J. Smith
What I showed you at the analyst meeting is still how I’m viewing this, which is in the year in which we launch a new process technology, so 2009 will be the year in which we launch 32-nanometer process technology, we tend to see a couple of points of elevation in other cost of sales off of a base of a couple of points. That’s over the year and it can spike a little bit more than that in a specific quarter but it tends to be a couple of points of gross margin. Now keep in mind, some of that is a classification of the research and development hedge in the year in which they are working on a process that’s going in production. They are classified as other cost of sales and the year in which they are working on a process that is not going in production, they are classified as R&D. That’s one of the reasons you saw our spending this year go up, was that classification. That was about a couple hundred million dollars worth of spending in 2008.
Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James

Okay so it’s a couple of points basically in the first-half of next year?
Stacy J. Smith
It’s a couple of points on the year and it will vary.
Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James

Okay, but front-end loaded?
Stacy J. Smith
The graph I showed you at the analyst meeting showed yeah, it will be higher in the first-half of 2009.
Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James

Very well. Thanks.
R. Kevin Sellers
Thanks, Hans. Next questioner.

Your next question comes from the line of John Barton with Cowen. Please proceed.
John Barton - Cowen & Company

Thank you very much. Paul, you talked about better-than-expected strength from the Atom processor. When I think about sources of demand, I put it in basically three buckets: so incremental first-time buyers from lower price points; increased number of notebook PCs per person; and then thirdly, potential substitution. I think you already touched on the fact you don’t believe any substitution is happening, but the demand in those first two buckets, how would you split that out?
Paul S. Otellini
I wouldn’t use your second category. It’s not PCs per person -- PCs per household. In many households, you’re going from one PC to multiple PCs with these machines and that was some of the early purchases and those purchases happened actually in the affluent cities or the tier 1 cities of some of the emerging market countries like China, where it became sort of a fashion item or machines for the kids. I think that in -- you know, who the heck knows but my guess is that this year, year one of NetBooks, 80% to 90% of the volume will fall in those first two categories and then maybe some substitution. And in year two and year three, I think it’s just too soon to call but our view is that these new price points, combined with a limited amount of features, which is required to enable the price points, are likely to generate a new segment in the business.
R. Kevin Sellers
John, do you have a follow up?
John Barton - Cowen & Company

I do; so if you think about the basic metrics of semiconductors, right, you’ve got the price lever, the computing performance lever, and then the power consumption lever, I think what I just heard you say is a major catalyst for adoption of Atom is certainly the price at a reduced computing performance. How much has the computing performance limited adoption and how do you -- 
Paul S. Otellini
You know, this is sort of less than a third of the performance of our Centrino, so you are dealing with something which is not -- you know, most of us wouldn’t use and you are dealing with something that is principally designed for net access, for web access, not really to run robust applications and I think it’s likely to stay that way for quite some time. As a comparative, you would not want to run YouTube video on these things all day long. You would not want to do any photo editing on these all day long, or even for a little bit of time. 
So I really think it’s a first-time buyer kind of thing and it will sort itself out, just like there is a different market for lower priced, lower performing cars than higher end cars.
Stacy J. Smith
I think that is specific to the PC segment where Atom plays. When you get out into 2009 and it is playing in the broader segments, you know, the power characteristics of Atom are likely to be -- 
Paul S. Otellini
Into handheld.
Stacy J. Smith
Into the handheld business, we’ll be just as defining.

Your next question comes from the line of Cody Acree with Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed.
Cody Acree - Stifel Nicolaus

Thanks, guys, for taking the questions and congratulations. Back on the Atom acceptance, obviously coming in very strong. Can you talk, maybe Stacy, about the offsets of Atom’s adoption, the curve of that pricing versus what you are seeing in the upside to 45-nanometer cost cuts?
Stacy J. Smith
Cody, I have to admit, I am not sure I understand your question.
Cody Acree - Stifel Nicolaus

So you are getting an improvement to gross margins because of cost reductions coming down with the 45-nanometer ramp; Atom is coming up, it’s got a lesser gross margin mix impact, so how do those two offset each other maybe as we look into the next few quarters?
Stacy J. Smith
Well, I guess the answer I’d have to give to that is they’re in the 58% gross margin that I have forecasted for Q3, so even with the Atom ramp, yeah, that’ll bring costs down; it’s likely to ship at a lower average selling price. But when I focus on the traditional, what I’ll call the microprocessor business without Atom, my costs come down in that segment of the business as well, so what I did is quantify for you the overall costs. I think it’s probably more on the traditional microprocessor business and less on Atom as we go across at least the second-half of this year.
Cody Acree - Stifel Nicolaus

And so that even with the Atom adoption, even with the overall cost reductions coming, price -- ASPs coming down, you’re still well out-running those?
Stacy J. Smith
Yeah, let me say it a different way -- even if I didn’t have Atom in the second-half of the year, my costs would be coming down nicely. I see my factories are running pretty full, my 45-nanometer process is healthy, I’m running good yields and product characteristics so my costs would be coming down even without the effect of Atom. 

Cody Acree - Stifel Nicolaus

And then lastly, can you -- I know that you said you would start to characterize as Atom starts to become more meaningful, just getting into a ramp but Atom is getting a lot of attention here and will likely continue. Can you characterize even weeks ahead, months ahead of where you thought you’d be, percentage ahead of where you thought you’d be or when we might be able to get a little more data?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, it depends on what points you start from. You know, versus last November, we’re 5X, 6X the volume for the year we thought we would -- since a month ago, we’re 10% above it.
Stacy J. Smith
Right. 
Cody Acree - Stifel Nicolaus

But versus maybe your expectations going into the quarter?
Stacy J. Smith
Going into the quarter, it would be -- for Q2, it came in about as we expected. Remember, Q2 was the launch quarter for this thing so it’s just we knew how much we --how the builds ramped and that’s pretty much what we sold. When you get into the Q3 again, as Paul said, it depends on what time period you choose but I guess from the beginning of Q2, outlook in Q3 is probably 50% higher than we expected, something in that order.
Cody Acree - Stifel Nicolaus

Great. Thanks, guys. 
R. Kevin Sellers
Thanks, Cody. Next questioner. 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of John Lau with Jefferies & Company. Please proceed. 
John Lau - Jefferies & Company

Great, thanks. Paul, in taking a step back, your guidance was very strong, especially in light of the uncertainty out there. Can you give us what the normal seasonality is? And more importantly, whether that guidance is based on the feedback that you get? I guess how comfortable are you with the visibility this year versus the prior years, given the uncertainty? Thank you. 
Paul S. Otellini
Well, we are equally on the hook this year versus other years, so we are relatively -- we’re very comfortable with the guidance we’ve given out. Normal seasonality is about 9% I think, Q2 to Q3 typically. 
One of the things that gives me comfort is our chipset shipments in Q2. We said the chipsets were a record in Q2. Chipsets, as you may know, are a leading indicator of microprocessor or PC assembly. They get soldered on -- they get purchased and then soldered onto motherboards multiple weeks ahead of the microprocessor, typically four to six weeks depending on the vendor. So the fact that we had very strong chipset shipments, record shipments and strong over the course of the quarter I think is a very good kind of a pointer for Q3, in addition to all of the other data we have. 
Stacy J. Smith
If I can just add to that, just to -- you know, for Q2, we would typically see the second quarter down a couple of percent, and if you strip out the impact of the NOR business divestiture, we were flat and for Q3, as Paul said, normal seasonality is 8.5% to 9%, in that kind of a range, and that’s consistent with our outlook. The midpoint of our outlook is right in there. 
R. Kevin Sellers
John, anything else?
John Lau - Jefferies & Company

Yeah, and I know that there has been a lot of questions on [inaudible] but can you just give us a quick schedule of the Larrabee, is that still on track with your expectations and sampling at the end of this year? Is that how that’s working out? Thank you. 
Paul S. Otellini
Yes, it’s on -- Larrabee is on track. We haven’t changed any schedules there. 
John Lau - Jefferies & Company

Great. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
Srini Pajjuri - Merrill Lynch
Thank you. Stacy, a couple of clarifications on the gross margin; first on the NAND side, what kind of an impact is NAND having on your gross margins now? I mean, if you were to exit NAND today, how will that impact your gross margin?
Stacy J. Smith
Our gross margin would be higher. 
Srini Pajjuri - Merrill Lynch
Well, by how much, is my question. 
Stacy J. Smith
Sorry, that was tongue-in-cheek. As you know I think from prior calls, we don’t break it out to that level of granularity. I will give you a little color commentary on what we saw and in Q2, and what I expect over the course of the rest of this year; the pricing environment continues to be weak. NAND for us in Q2 came in as we expected. The gross margin impact didn’t worsen from Q1 so it kind of stayed the same. We have costs coming down as the pricing comes down, which helps us and frankly, that’s what I expect into the second half. I expect a continued weak pricing environment but my costs come down nicely, so I think it doesn’t have either a positive or negative effect on the overall corporate gross margin. 
Srini Pajjuri - Merrill Lynch
Okay, and then my follow-up is I guess pretty much all of last year and earlier this year, you saw a pretty good benefit from makeshift to notebooks and now it seems like the notebook CPU pricing is probably close or even below the pricing of the desktop CPUs. So my question is are the margins still better in notebooks for you compared to your desktop segment?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, the notebook prices are still nicely above the desktop prices and I don’t see them converging frankly anytime on the horizon, simply because there is a premium associated with the power performance characteristics on those product lines, vis-à-vis the desktop. So while they are coming down, I think we’ve said this in the last couple of calls, this is something we expect. It’s a natural consequence of price volume expansion of the market and they are not moving to intercept desktop anytime soon from our perspective. And one of the ways that we are going to mitigate that is with Atom and NetBooks coming in, give us a much lower cost structure to be able to ride this curve than we did during the equivalent expansion of the desktop cycle five, six years ago. 
R. Kevin Sellers
Thanks, Srini. We’re going to take two more questions, if you could, two questioners. 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of  Michael McConnell with Pacific Crest Securities. Please proceed.
Michael McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities
Thank you. If we look at the gross margin guidance for the year, 57% and the implied margins of 58% and then 60% in Q4, how much is built in those forecasts that corporate adoption of Montevina will be healthy and kind of the same level that we see with Santa Rosa?
Stacy J. Smith
You know, if you’re asking me am I baking in an ASP increase to get there, that would be pretty unusual. The big drivers of gross margin as we go from Q2 to Q3 are, as I said, the costs coming down and the volume, and I expect my costs to come down again in Q4 and volume to be up again in Q4. Those are really the drivers. I’m not anticipating a mix shift to the high end or anything like that. 
Michael McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities
Well let me ask this another way, Stacy; so if your mix on notebooks is similar to what you saw in Q2, can you still get to 57% for the year?
Stacy J. Smith
Sure. 
Paul S. Otellini
In fact, I’d expect notebooks will continue to grow as a percent of our output. 
Stacy J. Smith
Yeah. 
Michael McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities
Okay, and then Paul, one last comment just on the healthy chipset strength you saw in Q2; any comments on what you are seeing in Q3?
Paul S. Otellini
Not in a leading -- nothing strange. Everything we see so far in terms of demand for chipsets is equally strong from the strength we saw in Q2. We’ll know a lot more three months from now when we see what the shipments are lining up for the fourth quarter, but right now in terms of the mix, particularly towards the newer chipsets, the demand is very strong. 
Michael McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities
Thank you. 
R. Kevin Sellers

And your last question comes from the line of Mr. Brian Piccioni with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed. 
Brian Piccioni - BMO Capital Markets
Thank you for taking my question. Obviously Atom has been a lot of the questions of this call. We mostly focused on the NetBook market for Atom. I’m sort of curious -- what do you expect the embedded market to be relative to NetBook sales? And as a follow-on, wondering if you have to make any ASP compromises for embedded applications. 
Paul S. Otellini
The second part of the question is no. At this point in time, the budget areas we’re putting out for embedded applications are in the same range as the desktop version, the higher power version of Atom that we are shipping in the PC space. And that’s because it’s essentially they’re using it -- they are being used as PC processors. Most of these things will run Windows or Linux. They’re Internet connections, general purpose reprogrammable machines, embedded market’s moving pretty rapidly in that direction. 
In terms of the mix, gosh, that’s hard to say. The problem is that, as you may know, the time from design win to production ramp at an embedded design, particularly some of these ones that are in regulated environments, can be one to two years. And so if we add up all of the design wins, it’s very strong. 
I don’t think that it would out-ship PC applications, PC uses but I think it will be a very strong part of the product line. 
Brian Piccioni - BMO Capital Markets
Super. Thank you very much. 
R. Kevin Sellers
Brian, any follow-ups? You good? 
Brian Piccioni - BMO Capital Markets
Yes, thank you.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q1 2008 Intel Corporation earnings conference call. My name is Denise and I will be your coordinator for today. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today’s call, Mr. Kevin Sellers, VP of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir. 
R. Kevin Sellers
Thank you, Denise and welcome everyone to Intel's Q1 2008 earnings conference call. Joining me on today’s call are Chief Executive Officer Paul Otellini and Chief Financial Office Stacy Smith. As usual, Paul will be discussing the highlights of the quarter and then Stacy will provide more details on our financial [results of Q1] as well as the outlook for both the second quarter and full year 2008. Following Stacy’s comments, we’ll be happy to take questions. 
A few important items before I turn it over to Paul; first, we’ve posted our earnings release and updated financial statements to our investor website, intc.com, for anyone who still needs access to that information. Also, if during this call we use any non-GAAP financial measures or references, we will put the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliations to our website, intc.com. And last, a replay of today’s call will be posted on our website around [6:00 Pacific Time] and will remain there for approximately two months. 
As we begin, let me remind everyone that today’s discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. 
So with that, let me now hand it over to Paul. 
Paul S. Otellini
Thanks, Kevin. The first quarter marked a very good start to 2008, driven by strong industry demand for our leading edge processors and chipsets. Our revenues grew 9% from the first quarter of last year while operating income improved by 23%. Our improved financial performance and strong balance sheet allowed us to pay a record dividend in the quarter, announce a dividend increase, and buy back $2.5 billion worth of stock -- decisions we made to increase returns for our shareholders. 
There was a particularly strong demand for our 45-nanometer based products and we continue to ramp that process rapidly, both in terms of volumes as well as in the breadth of product offerings. The benefits of this new process are giving Intel a unique combination of outstanding performance with low power consumption.  
In terms of the business, we saw all regions grow over last year with North America standing out, driven by strong server demand. In looking at inventories, the overall supply/demand equation for our processors and chipsets appears to be healthy and in balance. 
Our server business had a particularly strong quarter, turning in an all-time record in revenues. This was driven by three factors. First, we saw notable strength in the high-end, multi-processor segment, particularly in North America. This is due to the ramp of our Caneland MP platform. 
Second, in the higher volume dual processor category, we saw quad-core shipments continue to grow and now represent a majority of our Xeon DP shipments. 
And lastly, we saw our total Xeon processor shipments cross over to 45-nanometer based products during the quarter, further extending our leadership in this high volume segment. 
We have previously discussed the PC market’s transition to mobility and our results in Q1 show continued acceleration of this trend. Our unit shipments were up sharply versus last year and with the introduction of the low cost Netbook category, we believe that the shipment crossover of desktop PCs to mobile PCs will now happen this year and not next year, as we originally anticipated. 
Our desktop business also had a solid quarter, with good year-over-year growth. Quad-core remains a competitive strength in this segment and we are seeing two important trends in the desktop that offer good growth opportunities. First is the growth of the all-in-one category, where our power optimized 45-nanometer processors are a natural solution. The second is the growth of vPro technology in corporate environments driven by our unique manageability features. 
Last month I committed to our investors that I would not let our Flash memory business become a long-term drag on the financials of the company. First, in our NOR business, we closed the Numonyx transaction. This is an important step for us and one that is good for Intel and its shareholders. 
In our NAND business, we are making some decisions on capacity to mitigate this current over-supply situation. Recently we made a decision with Micron to push out the timing of our joint Singapore factory. We will continue to look at other options and keep you informed. I want to assure our shareholders that we entered this business to make money and we will continue to make the appropriate decisions necessary to that end. 
Just about a month ago, we hosted many of you here at our headquarters for our investor day and we talked in detail about our new growth initiatives. I want to take just a moment to comment on some of the progress we made during the first quarter. 
First, we launched our newly branded ATOM processor family, an innovative line of low power, cost optimized processors that will be used in a number of new product categories. We began shipping ATOM processors for revenue in the quarter and are very pleased with the early acceptance and interest from a broad and diverse range of customers. 
In addition to the momentum we are seeing in the Netbook category, we are also gaining momentum in the mobile Internet device category, announcing at our recent Intel Developers Forum a total of 35 new designs across 25 customers for this segment. 
And finally, I spoke briefly at our investor meeting about our embedded business and the opportunity this represents going forward. I am pleased to say that growth in this category is accelerating, showing strong double-digit unit and revenue gains year over year. 
In summary, as I look at the results of the first quarter and out into the rest of 2008, I see three important trends unfolding. First, the competitive position of our core business is superb. The benefits of our 45-nanometer process technology are tangible. We expect our differentiation to grow as we aggressively ramp this new technology. 
The second trend is our cost structure. As Stacy will discuss momentarily, our product costs declined quarter by quarter over 2008, which supports gross margin expansion throughout the rest of the year. 
And the final trend is momentum in our new growth initiatives where we are seeing real progress, both in terms of product development and customer engagement. Our strategy of bringing the Intel architecture to new market segments combined with the world’s most advanced process technology will prove extremely valuable to our investors. 
Let me now turn the call over to Stacy for a detailed look at our financial performance for the first quarter. Stacy. 
Stacy J. Smith
Thanks, Paul. Q1 was a solid start to the year, as microprocessor business strength and strong execution overcame a challenging Flash market and a volatile macroeconomic environment. Compared to the first quarter of 2007, revenue grew 9% with gross margin dollars up 17% and operating profit up 23% year over year. Operating income as a percentage of revenue was over 21% for the first quarter and we generated over $2 billion of cash flow from operations. 
Revenue for the first quarter was $9.7 billion, at the midpoint of the range forecasted in January, down 10% from the fourth quarter and up 9% from a year ago. Microprocessor sales were roughly seasonal, with average selling prices approximately flat while the combined revenue of NOR and NAND Flash was down 15% from the fourth quarter. 
More than half of total revenue, $5.3 billion, came from the digital enterprise group. Revenue for this group was approximately 8% lower than the fourth quarter and up 11% from the prior year. Server microprocessors showed particular strength, with units up significantly from Q1 2007. 
The mobility group accounted for more than a third of total revenue. This revenue of $3.7 billion was down 11% from the fourth quarter and up 11% from the prior year. Mobile microprocessor units were up significantly year over year and average mobile microprocessor prices declined due to the growth of the lower system price segments. 
Looking at a geographical breakout, all geographies experienced year-over-year growth in Q1, with the Americas region seeing the strongest growth of 17%. EMEA and APAC were both up 8% year over year and Japan was up 4%. The strength in the Americas was primarily due to strong demand for our 45-nanometer server products. 
Gross margin dollars were $5.2 billion, $1 billion lower than the fourth quarter. Gross margin percentage of approximately 54% was consistent with the midpoint of the revised outlook that we set at the beginning of March and two points lower than the outlook set in January. As expected, the majority of the decline from the January outlook was due to the significantly lower pricing and higher volume in our NAND memory business.  
In a quarter to quarter comparison, gross margin was four points lower than the fourth quarter. Four things contributed approximately equally: CPU units were lower in the seasonally down quarter; chipset inventory write-offs, including products built prior to qualification for sale; CPU unit costs higher as we ramp the 45-nanometer process; and non-product cost of sales, primarily due to start-up charges for 45-nanometer factories. 
In a year-to-year comparison, gross margin percentage is four points higher than the first quarter of 2007. 
R&D and MG&A were approximately $2.8 billion, within the forecasted range of $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion and down over 4% from the fourth quarter. In addition, we had restructuring and asset impairment charges of $329 million. Of this, $275 million was related to the assets transferred to Numonyx. 
The headcount reduction associated with employees transferring to Numonyx will be reflected in the second quarter. For the first quarter, the number of employees is down by 1,700 from Q4 to approximately 85,000. 
Gains, losses on equity investments, and interest and other income of $109 million was lower than the fourth quarter and lower than our outlook. Compared to the fourth quarter, it is lower primarily as a result of lower interest and other income. 
The provision for taxes in the first quarter was at a 33.5% tax rate, higher than the 31% previously forecasted. We now expect a higher proportion of profits will be generated in higher tax jurisdictions. In addition, the Q1 impairment related to assets sold to Numonyx negatively impacted our tax rate since the assets were located in lower tax jurisdictions. A combination of these two factors resulted in the higher Q1 tax rate. 
On the balance sheet, total inventories were down $98 million, or 3% from the quarter. Microprocessor inventories increased slightly in Q1, in line with our desire to build a bit of inventory on new microprocessor products. 
Total cash investments comprised of cash, short-term investments, and fixed income trading assets ended the quarter at $13.2 billion, $1.6 billion less than the fourth quarter. Cash flow from operations was over $2 billion. Capital spending was $900 million. Dividend payments were $740 million, and stock repurchases were $2.5 billion. 
As we turn now to the outlook for the second quarter, please keep in mind unless otherwise specified the forecasts do not include the effect of any new acquisitions, divestitures, or similar transactions that may be completed after April 14th. I will use the midpoint of the forecasted ranges when making comparisons to specific periods. 
We are planning for revenue, which is typically lower in the second quarter, to be between $9 billion and $9.6 billion. The midpoint of this range would be a decrease of 4% from the first quarter. As a result of the Numonyx transaction, we expect NOR Flash revenue to decline by approximately $200 million from the first quarter to the second quarter. Excluding that revenue decline, revenue is down approximately 1.5%, at the high end of the seasonal range. 
In Q2, we anticipate NOR Flash revenue of approximately $100 million through a supply agreement with Numonyx, declining to approximately $50 million a quarter by year-end. On a year-to-year basis, the outlook anticipates revenue growth of 7%. Excluding the decline in NOR revenue, the growth would be approximately 11% year over year. 
Our expectation for gross margin percentage in the second quarter is 56%, plus or minus a couple of points. Quarter to quarter, the NOR Flash divestiture and lower chipset inventory write-offs contribute about one point each. The gross margin impact of the CPU business is slightly positive, better than the decline typically seen in the second quarter. 
Spending for R&D and MG&A in the second quarter should be between $2.8 billion and $2.9 billion. Additionally, in a separate category for restructuring and asset impairment charges, we expect expenses of approximately $250 million. While we have no full year forecast for this category, we do expect charges as a result of our restructuring program announced in 2006 to decline through the remainder of the year. 
Depreciation is forecasted to be approximately $1.1 billion. Our estimate for gains and losses from equity investments and interest and other income is a net gain of $75 million, lower than the first quarter, primarily due to lower interest income. 
Looking beyond the second quarter as volume increases and costs decline, we expect gross margin to improve with second half margins significantly above the first half. We maintain our forecast for gross margin for the full year at 57% plus or minus a few points. 
Strength in the microprocessor business is offsetting the weakness in the NAND pricing environment. 
Spending for R&D and MG&A for the full year is forecasted to be approximately $11.5 billion, up $100 million from the prior forecast, primarily due to foreign exchange impacts of the weakened U.S. dollar. R&D spending is forecasted to be approximately $6 billion, up $100 million from the prior forecast and MG&A spending is forecasted to be approximately $5.5 billion, flat to the prior forecast. 
The tax rate for each of the remaining quarters in the year is now expected to be 33%, two points higher than the prior forecast based on a higher concentration of profits and higher tax jurisdictions. 
We enter 2008 with the strongest combination of products, silicon technology, and manufacturing leadership in our history. The first quarter results and the current outlook reflect this strength in our core business. 
As we look into the second half of the year, we are planning for growth and improving financial results, driven by our product leadership, the ramp of the ATOM processor, the build-out of three 45-nanometer high volume factories, declining unit costs, and the impact of our restructuring program. 
With that, let me turn it back to Kevin. 
R. Kevin Sellers
Okay, thanks, Stacy. Denise, we’d now like to have you open the line for questions and answers. 
Question-and-Answer Session

Operator
(Operator Instructions) From Deutsche Bank, your first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore. Please proceed. 
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Just looking at the demand environment in general, it appeared that the microprocessor side was exactly in line with your expectations but can you give us just a little color if there were any gyrations throughout the quarter of strengthening or weakening? Just linearity I guess would be the easiest way to say it. 
Stacy J. Smith
Sure. The quarter came in -- on the microprocessor side of the business, the quarter came in as expected and we didn’t see anything unusual when you look at how the quarter unfolded. It was pretty normal. 
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
What about on the ASP side of things? Your competitor clearly had a negative pre-announcement. It looks from our side there like there’s some price increases they are trying to put through. You guys had the flat ASPs but are you noticing any change on the pricing environment?
Stacy J. Smith
Our ASP was roughly flat in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter. If you look across the last three or four quarters, it’s been roughly flat now. This is the fourth quarter in a row. So I would characterize the pricing environment as being pretty much the same as what we’ve seen. I think we really are benefiting from the strength of our product lineup. 
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
And then the final question on the CapEx, it looks like you under spent the annual rate, even though you reiterated the full year guidance. Anything going on there?
Stacy J. Smith
No, nothing unusual. It’s just a little bit of linearity in terms of the spends as we are ramping 45-nanometer, but we are still on track to the capital forecast for the year. 
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Great. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from Merrill Lynch. 
Srini Pajjuri - Merrill Lynch 
Thank you. Stacy, you said your NOR is going down to about $100 million and then it is going to go down to 50, so I’m just wondering, should we expect a benefit to gross margins? And then on the NAND front, it looks like you are assuming a fairly weak market. What is the risk that that’s going to come back and surprise us at some point on the positive or negative side?
Stacy J. Smith
Surprise us on the negative side or the positive side?
Srini Pajjuri - Merrill Lynch 
Both. 
Stacy J. Smith
I would love a positive surprise in the memory business but I’m not banking on it. In the NOR, the way the supply agreement is set up on the NOR side, the gross margin impact from Q1 to Q2 is about a point as the $200 million goes to Numonyx. I don’t expect that to be significant going forward, so I think that’s pretty much the impact you are going to see. 
What we have baked in on the NAND side for the year is an assumption of a continued over-supply in the NAND market, which brings bit pricing down, although our costs get better quarter on quarter, so I think it kind of isn’t going to be the same magnitude that we saw from Q4 to Q1, but it continues to be a pretty weak pricing environment as I see it going forward and it could be a little better than that, it could be a little worse but that’s how we’re calling the business right now. 
Srini Pajjuri - Merrill Lynch 
Okay and then on inventories, you said your CPU inventories went up a little bit. Just looking out to the next couple of quarters, do you think -- do you feel comfortable where you are or do you need to take it up a bit from here?
Stacy J. Smith
In Q4 we were a little less than we’d like, and so I told you in the call last quarter that I wanted to put a little bit of inventory in place on some of our new CPU products. You would typically see us build a little bit of inventory in the second quarter and that’s pretty consistent with how I’m viewing the inventory right now. 
Srini Pajjuri - Merrill Lynch 
Okay, and then my final question for Paul; Paul, it looks like you did pick up some share from AMD just based on their pre-announcement. I’m just wondering if this is mostly from server market or just looking out to the other two as well, notebooks and desktops. And also my question is how sustainable do you think these share gains are? And also, if you could give us -- help us understand what is driving these share gains. Thank you. 
Paul S. Otellini
I think that we’ll follow the practice we’ve used the last few quarters on share, which is we’ll wait for the -- all the numbers come in and have the independent parties report and then we’ll absorb it. 
What I can say is that as I pointed out in my comments, we had a very strong quarter in server, in the server segment this last quarter, particularly driven by our ramp of the MP Caneland platform and that allowed us to achieve record server revenues. So I suspect there is some good news in share gain in that number set. 
The other thing that was strong this quarter was mobile and as we look forward in the course of the year with the crossover from the desktop to the notebook happening essentially a year sooner than we first had thought, I think that is good news for Intel given the strength of our product line, both on the Centrino side and now with the Netbooks and ATOM starting to show fairly good volume projections. 
Srini Pajjuri - Merrill Lynch 
Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Sumit Dhanda from Banc of America Securities. Please proceed. 
Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America
A couple of questions; Stacy, your outlook for the core business in the second quarter, high end of seasonal, down 1.5%, just curious as to what’s driving that expectation. Is it the ramp of the Netbook type products, your expectations of more share gain just given what is ostensibly the perception of the macroeconomic backdrop as a big headwind?
Stacy J. Smith
It’s a variety of things but I would call out the ramp of the Netbook product as something that I see being a contributor over the course of the year and we are going to start to see the impact of that in the second quarter. It does look to be driving some incremental unit growth beyond what I thought when I first set my forecast for the year. 
Paul S. Otellini
Let me come back to -- let me tag on that and then come back to your comment on macroeconomics. Just to remind you, we’ve got 75% of our revenues are not in the U.S. now and much of the concern on macroeconomic debate has to do with the U.S., particularly the Manhattan portion of the U.S. So we don’t see this really impacting our business at this time and haven’t seen it so far in the last couple of quarters. 
And then secondly in my experience, when there are more difficult economic times, people do two things -- they turn to information technology for productivity gains for their enterprises and they tend to buy the best-of-breed products that are out there. As that happens, if it happens, Intel is in a pretty good position. 
Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America
Just a follow-up or two; Stacy, on the OpEx line, your employee count down 1,700 following the divestiture of the NOR Flash business -- was this benefit all accounted for in your initial projections or is there a negative offset to this positive development here as you head into the back-half of the -- in other words why the [inaudible] forecast not come down?
Stacy J. Smith
The divestiture of the NOR business was encompassed in my annual forecast. As I told you last quarter, we were counting it in in Q1 and then out for the rest of the year. It closed on day two of -- or day one of Q2 so pretty much as I anticipated when I set the guidance for the year. 
The increase we are seeing in the OpEx line is the impact of foreign exchange rates being higher has caused us to raise that by $100 million. 
Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America
Okay and just one last final two-parter; first, on the tax rate, is it possible that it reverts back to a lower figure? Because clearly the Americas outperformed, or is the fact that NOR is no longer part of the mix a permanent headwind so to speak? And then secondly, what were the chipset unit inventory write-offs that you were able to -- 
Stacy J. Smith
Sure. That’s not a two-part question, that’s two separate questions but I’ll be happy to answer it. On the tax rate, we see two effects in Q1 that are both attributable to the Numonyx transaction. One is that transaction changes our distribution of revenue so that we have a higher proportion of our revenue in higher tax jurisdictions. That’s an underlying rate issue and then we had a one-time issue in the quarter which is the impairment on the assets that we took for Numonyx. That impairment hit lower tax jurisdictions, so we got less of a tax effect than you’d expect and that raises our rate for the quarter. 
To your question of could it come back down, yeah, my expectation is that when we get out in time, then we’ve ramped the Israel factory on 45-nanometers, the third of three factories, that it will start to move the distribution of our revenue back out of the U.S. into some lower tax jurisdictions. It’s likely to be more of a 2009 effect than a 2008 effect. 
To your chipset question, what you see there is just a very normal process of the build that we had on chipsets prior to qualifying that product for sale, so we reserved those -- we reserved that chipset product and you see that reversing in the second quarter where we don’t retake that and so that’s part of the one point of good news in the second quarter. 
Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America
Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung from Citigroup. Please proceed. 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
Thanks. Paul, could I just ask you to clarify about your statements on the macro? We’ve been seeing some signs that the European business may be slowing down and I just want to double-check your views on Europe looking into the second quarter. 
Paul S. Otellini
Well, we had I think a very, very good Q4 in Europe, as you may remember, Glen. And we had a very good Q1 in North America this time, so I’d look at the integral six months and say that from a macroeconomic standpoint, the two most mature of our markets are not showing any signs of weakness. 
I was just in Europe two weeks ago meeting with customers and I did not pick up anything other than what I’ve indicated today. 
Stacy J. Smith
It’s also notable that we had 8% year-on-year growth in Europe and that’s pretty close to the average on a year-on-year basis, so we saw growth across every geography in Q1 on a year-on-year basis. 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
That’s good to know. Okay, thanks. Second question is on unit costs in the second quarter. I think I heard one of the two of you say that they would be down, so I just want to double-check that. 
And then I guess I’m trying to understand what’s going on with 45-nanometer mix. I know you set a target at the beginning of the year which I don’t remember if you made public or not but I know that there is a target and I wonder if that target is now more than originally thought. 
And I guess an add-on question to this is what is 45-nanometer as a proportion of inventories and does that sort of account for all the -- for where inventories are?
Stacy J. Smith
I’ll take one and three and Paul will take two. I didn’t break out costs for the second quarter. What I said was that you normally see the CPU business being slightly negative on the overall gross margin in the second quarter and we are really not seeing that in this second quarter. That’s a comment on the strength of the business. So normally what you’d see is volumes down, costs down a bit, you know, it causes the overall gross margin to be down a bit. And we’re not seeing that effect this time as we do the forecast for the second quarter, so it’s roughly flat on the overall Q2 gross margin. 
And on your question about 45-nanometer inventory, virtually all of the products that were put into inventory over the course of the first quarter was new microprocessor products, so we look at that pretty carefully in terms of the Asia products and it’s a very healthy inventory level and the product that’s in inventory is also very healthy product. 
Paul S. Otellini
And lastly on the mix, I did show that slide at the investor meeting and it shows a crossover in the third quarter and we are still on track to that and we are ramping as fast as we can. And we’ve -- I think I said at the analyst meeting, we have shipped in excess of 4 million units. At this point in time, we’ve shipped in excess of 8 million units, so we are moving very quickly up the ramp curve. 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
That’s great and then just last question here for Stacy on the interest income line -- I want you to just walk us through the decline in that number going forward and just what’s driving that. 
Stacy J. Smith
Sure. I told you at the analyst meeting that our cash balances were a little higher than we wanted and higher than the target we set with the board. So talking through the Q1 to Q2 reduction, it really is driven by interest income and there’s a couple of components to that. As you know, interest rates are down so we earn a bit less on the portfolio that we have but also I plan to bring the cash balance down a bit more in the second quarter. 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
All right, thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Uche Orji with UBS. Please proceed. 
Uche Orji - UBS
Thank you very much. Paul, first question is for you; I’m just a little bit positively surprised by the comments you made on North America, especially on servers. If you don’t mind, I would just like to probe that a little bit. My question is how much of this could have been the pent-up demand for 45-nanometer and of course I know it’s continued into Q2 but if you were to look through your various categories of customers, is there a particular area where strength is coming from? I mean, if I look at -- you mentioned Manhattan. If I look at financial services, of course we are not seeing IT budgets going up, so if you can give us any more color just to explain this that would be very helpful. 
Paul S. Otellini
Those questions may best be answered by Hewlett-Packard and Dell and IBM when they come up but from our perspective as we look through, I actually disagree with you on financial services. I think that you are right on the PC side, we have heard about some softness as the banks cut back employees and so forth. But on the back office stuff, they are still deploying the most advanced technology they can to get the -- for the obvious advantage of speed of transactions. So I take issue with your assertion there. 
We saw pretty broad-based wide customer-based adoption of MP at a very strong ramp on Caneland, and as I said the quad-core, particularly 45-nanometer quad-core mix, accelerated over the quarter as our volume grew. 
We are -- to mix your question and Glen’s together on 45-nanometer, we are filling from the top. The bulk of our 45-nanometer output starts out in servers, moves to mobile, then moves to desktop. 
Uche Orji - UBS
Another question, Paul -- thanks for that, that’s helpful. Another question is regarding your pricing strategy. If I look at your strategic positioning [inaudible] your strategy with pricing say for the rest of the year to kind of keep it flattish, or do you have a chance now to kind of [inaudible] you know, into higher speeds or higher ASP as a way to kind of create more value? So if I look through the rest of the year, is it possible for you to talk through what will be your strategy for pricing? Of course I know this is dependent on what the environment looks like, but from your perspective any sense of what we should be thinking about when we think about price would be helpful. 
Paul S. Otellini
I can assure you that we are always trying to sell up to the highest performing products in any of our segments, so that’s just -- that’s just standard operating procedure. When our mix is as competitive as it is today, we have a better chance of doing that and so look to try to see us move towards MP, towards faster Xeons, towards faster notebooks as much as possible. 
Offsetting that I have to say is, and this is the unknown, is the ramp of which things like the Netbook, the ATOM based Netbooks start taking off, which have a lower average selling price but as we’ve shown you at the analyst meeting, awfully good margins. And that segment we still think is going to -- it will be net accretive to the overall TAM for notebooks. 
Uche Orji - UBS
Right, that’s helpful. Thank you very much, Paul. Appreciate it. 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Please proceed. 
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse 
Thanks, guys. Congratulations. Paul, a couple of questions, just getting back to the macro, you said 75% of your business is outside the U.S. On the server front, I’m assuming there’s a much higher concentration within the U.S. and I’m just kind of curious -- do you think market share gains or mix is a better driver? Because you’ve now had I guess three consecutive quarter, Q3, Q4, and now Q1 where server demand has been extremely strong for you guys. 
Paul S. Otellini
I think we’ll let the server, the MSS question sort itself out but I think it’s probably a bit of both as it sorts out. One of the things that we’ve talked about is this growth of the large Internet data centers who are now consuming a very measurable part of the server output and sometimes they buy from us directly and sometimes they buy through our OEM customers. 
Their growth, I mean, you saw the stories about Amazon and Google in the papers in the last couple of days, their growth is really quite large as they try to build up their infrastructure for cloud computing. And I think that is a driver that is measurably different in the last couple of quarters than in the previous few before that. And on top of that, you’ve got the quality of the product line which may be helping on share. 
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse 
And then Paul, on the mobility side, if you look over the last four quarters, revenue growth is still very healthy but is decelerated from above 20% to now about 11.7. Is that all pricing and mix as you get into these new end markets? Is that the primary contributor there?
Paul S. Otellini
Yeah, it’s by far -- it’s the predominant driver by far. 
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse 
And then Stacy, just two quick housekeeping questions around the NAND front; first, any money that you guys give to IMFT, does that show up in the $5.2 billion capital budget? And can you give us a sense of how much capital you are planning to commit to that joint venture this year?
Stacy J. Smith
So it does not show up in the CapEx spending, so the $5.2 billion is what we are spending for our internal factories. And as we push out the Singapore factory a bit, it’s a little premature to say how much CapEx will do. It’s likely to come down from what we thought a few weeks ago. 
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse 
And then lastly, just to help us given that the pricing of NAND was an issue to Q1 gross margins, how much does NAND pricing have to fall in Q1 before we need to start to worry about your gross margin guidance for the quarter?
Stacy J. Smith
It’s probably best if I talk about what I see for the rest of the year and I’ll give you a little bit of color commentary on what we saw Q4 to Q1 and then over the rest of the year. We see a continued over-supply in the NAND market. That’s pretty consistent with what most of the external analysts are saying as well. So we do see pricing coming down on a gigabit level. We are taking some actions to improve our mix and our financial performance but we do see pricing coming down and also our costs come down, so it should be relatively gross margin neutral from here on out to what we have modeled in. 
The real difference is Q4 to Q1, our gigabit production doubled. We had a new factory that had come on line and we now see that kind of flattening out over the rest of the year. So even if there is a big drop in NAND pricing, it’s not going to have the same magnitude on any given quarter as what we saw Q4 to Q1 because of that bit doubling that hit us at the same time that the prices came down by half. 
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse 
Great, thanks, guys. 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs. 
James Covello - Goldman Sachs
Good afternoon. Maybe Stacy, first question -- can you help us quantify how much NAND is dragging down overall gross margins for the full year 2008?
Stacy J. Smith
More than we thought when we originally set the forecast for the quarter, but I’m not going to break it out. You know, we had a big impact in Q1 and I think it’s going to be pretty much gross margin neutral as we go through the year from where we are. Again, I’ve got costs coming down about the same rate that I see pricing coming down. And then we are also looking at a series of other options to both improve our business on a tactical basis and if it’s not going to give the kind of financial performance that we are holding it to, then we’ll go take other options. I think that’s all I can say on NAND right now. 
James Covello - Goldman Sachs
That’s helpful. And then, relative to the margins in Q1, which were as you said were lower because the NAND, and then the guidance for the full year gross margins remaining the same, what is helping in the back half of the year offset the weakness in the first quarter?
Stacy J. Smith
Yeah, it’s not just the back half of the year. It’s actually Q2 is up a bit from what I thought a quarter ago, and what we are seeing is just continued -- some growing strength in the core business. Specifically, I see some incremental growth coming from the ATOM processor. I see costs coming down and that’s offsetting the weakness that we are seeing in NAND. 
James Covello - Goldman Sachs
Is it -- I think you guys had commented on originally that some of the gross margin you had assumed for the year you were assuming a competitive product from your competitor and assuming some price competition as a result of that. Any possibility that some of that isn’t as bad as you might have expected because of your product differentiation?
Stacy J. Smith
I think we’ll have to wait and see as we get into the second half on how their products perform and the rate at which they are able to ramp it. 
James Covello - Goldman Sachs
Okay, and then final question, just around the competitive environment, obviously our product differentiation is creating a difficult situation for your competitors, or your competitor. Is there a point at which the competitive environment gets too dire for them and how do you think about strategically your actions in the face of the competitive environment, giving how well you are doing and how poorly they are doing?
Paul S. Otellini
I think you’ll have to ask them the first part of that question. I don’t think I’m qualified to answer it but in terms of the way we look at it, my job is simply to bring out the best products as possible and meet customer needs and drive dynamism in the marketplace in terms of new products and new technologies that stimulate market growth. That’s been the Intel CEO’s job for two decades and I don’t see it changing. 
Stacy J. Smith
And it’s really stark if you look at the difference in our results back a year-and-a-half ago when we didn’t have product leadership to today when we do. It really drives a very different set of financial execution for us. 
James Covello - Goldman Sachs
Great. Final question and then I’ll be done -- [Hallum] still on track?
Paul S. Otellini
Yes, sir.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Danely from J.P. Morgan. 
Christopher Danely - J.P. Morgan 
Could you talk about what utilization rates did in Q1 and where you expect them to go for the rest of the year, or is it that everything is kind of running flat out right now?
Stacy J. Smith
It’s pretty much the same that I showed you at the analyst meeting about a month ago. Utilizations are what I would consider in the sweet spot over the course of 2008. You know, not too hot, not too cold. 
Christopher Danely - J.P. Morgan 
And then Stacy, it sounds like you are also going to deploy some more cash in Q2 so we can assume another buy-back?
Stacy J. Smith
You know, we have an ongoing buy-back program. We did a good buy-back in Q1. It was $2.5 billion. We paid a dividend. We actually announced an increase in our dividend. As I told you at the investor meeting, we’ll utilize both of those mechanisms to keep cash at the level agreed with the board. Beyond that, I can’t go any further in commenting on the first quarter. 
Christopher Danely - J.P. Morgan 
That’s fine. And it sounds like the NOR business is about $300 million. Why are you guys keeping $100 million in revenue for Q2 and the 50 for Q3 and Q4?
Stacy J. Smith
So it’s not that we’re -- we’re actually supplying wafers to Numonyx on a supply agreement for some products in factories that they didn’t take and so that supply agreement will run the course over 2008, maybe a little bit at the beginning of 2009 and then it will be done. 
Christopher Danely - J.P. Morgan 
Okay, and then last question just for Paul -- so Paul, to reiterate, you see no troubling signs of demand either from the U.S. or Europe or Asia? 
Paul S. Otellini
No we haven’t.

Your next question comes from the line of Tim Luke with Lehman Brothers.  
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers
Thanks so much. Stacy, I was wondering, with respect to the mobility business, it looked like what your outlying strength in the server business in terms of the revenue and the profitability, that while I think Paul was saying that your notebook business was strong relative to your expectations, the operating margin there looked lower versus the fourth quarter but lower than it’s been in a while. Do you have any color on the operating level there and what some of the issues might have been?
Stacy J. Smith
Sure, and actually it’s probably best seen -- you see the same impact year-on-year, so let me give you Q107 to Q108. It’s best seen there and it really is the price of success for the mobile business. They pick up now a larger percentage of the allocated costs across the company. As Paul said, we’re seeing that crossover point a year earlier than we thought so they are picking up a larger percentage of the process technology development spending that we do that we allocate to the group. So that’s a chunk of it. 
We also made the decision to transition our advertising from the first half of last year where we were doing Core 2 Duo based advertising. It is now Centrino based advertising, so they are picking up a much larger percentage of the overall advertising budget of the company. It really is those kinds of things that are impacting the operating margin. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers
Do you have any color -- in saying that the ASPs were flat, maybe the server ASPs were up because you had strong revenue and new product. How was the notebook ASP and maybe the desktop ASP?
Stacy J. Smith
I pretty much said the notebook ASP in my speech. We saw notebook ASPs coming down some, same as last quarter as the notebook form factors moving into the consumer segment and emerging markets, we see good strong unit growth and it’s partially offset by the ASP coming down as it’s hitting these new price segments of the market. That was true in Q1 as it was true in Q4. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers
And the desktop ASP obviously lower as well, right? 
Stacy J. Smith
I’m not going to go segment by segment. The two significant ones was we saw good growth in the server market, we saw good growth in units in the notebook market offset a little bit by ASP. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers
And going forward then, the operating margin for the mobility business, we would think about it being more in this mid to low 30s range, is that how we should think about it?
Stacy J. Smith
Going forward, their allocation over the course -- we’re not making a new advertising decision, so that’s kind of all in the Q1 result. We do the allocation methodology on a semi-annual basis, so it’s probably going to look a little better as the revenue grows over the course of the year would be my guess. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers
Separately, just with respect to the chipset revenues versus the MP revenues, it looks like the sequential decline in chipsets was more pronounced than the sequential decline in microprocessors and similarly in the prior quarter, the revenue growth had lagged what it was in microprocessors. Any color on some of the dynamics in chipsets for both enterprise and mobility versus microprocessors?
Stacy J. Smith
Let me give an aggregated comment on chipsets and then maybe Paul wants to give some color on the different segments, I don’t know. We had a very strong Q4 in chipsets. What we saw in Q1 in total on chipsets was pretty much as we expected and kind of within the wide range of outcomes that you typically see from a Q4 to Q1, so we didn’t see anything unusual there. 
You also have to keep in mind that within that chipset and other revenue segment, we had some revenue that’s gone away. We were providing some supply agreements due to our divestiture of the handheld business. We had some other small divestitures, that kind of hits that line item. So a little bit of what you are seeing is due to some of those effects and I articulated those at the beginning of the quarter. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers
Paul, anything on that? I mean, should we continue to expect chipsets to lag the microprocessor revenue growth or is there going to be a catch-up at some point?
Paul S. Otellini
They lead and they lag. It depends on the season. In the second half of the year they tend to build up. There’s about an eight to 12-week, depending on the form factor, lead time of chipsets ahead of microprocessors. So as you move towards the volume parts of the year, the chipsets start to pick up in advance of microprocessor seasonality and then as you come into this part of the year, you have the trough because Q2 is typically lower than Q1. 
So I think what you are seeing -- I wouldn’t read anything into that. Our view of our -- our competitiveness in chipsets is unchanged. We think we are -- we have a very strong position here. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers
Lastly, if I may, just on the NAND bit growth, I think at the analyst meeting Stacy you had suggested that the bit growth in NAND would be maybe even flattish going forward after a strong ramp in the first calendar quarter. Do you have any color there?
And then separately, given the industry commentary around the battery fire in perhaps in the notebook outlook, I was just wondering if there was -- it doesn’t seem like in your guidance there’s any impact there at all but I was just wondering if you had any color there on how we should think about that. 
Stacy J. Smith
Sure. So on NAND, consistent with what I said at the analyst meeting, we saw incremental capacity coming on in Q4 and Q1 that absolutely impacted our results. Over the course of the rest of the year, we don’t have incremental capacity coming on. Our bits grow a little bit as yields improve but compared to what we saw last couple of quarters, that will be pretty minor. 
And we had the next increment of capacity coming on with the Singapore factory and in conjunction with Micron, we’ve made a decision to push that out while we watch the market. 
In terms of the battery fire, our forecast encompasses what we see there. We’re not seeing that as an impact on the quarter. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers
Thanks. Good luck.

Your next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann from Raymond James. 
Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James
Paul, a quick question on the NAND situation -- what is on the table with your discussions with Micron regarding possible action and in terms of that, could you possibly consider getting out of the NAND business completely?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, I really don’t think it’s appropriate to get into that, Hans. I mean, there’s a lot of ideas that we have here and talking about them publicly before they are realized or discussed I think is inappropriate and weakens our negotiating position and our options. So I really can’t comment on that prior to doing it. 
We had similar questions raised on NOR a year-and-a-half ago about what are you going to do about it and we couldn’t answer those, even though we were in discussions with ST, so it’s just -- I would -- that’s why I put the statement I made in my commentary on this has our focus and you have our commitment on the long-term, non-drag on the business.

Your next question comes from the line of John Barton from Cowen & Company. 
John Barton - Cowen & Company
Thank you very much. Paul, as you start to see more and more design wins for the ATOM roll in and you start the shipping for revenue, as you look at those wins is there anything that’s changed in your view with respect to what the real adopters would be as far as either emerging economies, mature economies, MIDs, notebooks, et cetera?
Paul S. Otellini
I think it’s too soon to call that. Certainly some of the -- I think the bulk of the early sales of the Netbooks has been in -- either in mature markets or tier one cities of places like China, and most people that are buying them are buying them as a fashion accessory, as a second or third notebook in the household, or women because of the form factor, both the keyboard is more amenable to their hand size or fits in a purse and those kinds of things. 
But I think we are in the early stage of it still. I mean, it’s like the early days of the iPod and as you have different versions come out and different price points come out, I would expect us to move in particularly well in emerging markets. 
John Barton - Cowen & Company
And as you review the design wins and the competitive dynamics out there, what actually do you see as the primary competition for an alternate processor choice and then how you think that potentially evolves through the following year?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, you’ve seen some already. I mean, HP has one based upon Via already, so that’s certainly one that’s out there today. But in terms of the overall technology, in terms of performance and battery life and integration of chipsets, we think we are in a pretty good position to take advantage of the category we are creating. 
John Barton - Cowen & Company
With respect to overall PC demand, you know, you were pretty adamant about your statements the June quarter looks basically seasonal, you are not seeing anything to make you fearful of North America, et cetera. Can I extrapolate from that that your view of 2008 really hasn’t changed much since the last time you made a comment? I think you had low double-digit PC unit growth shipments for ’08. Is that fair?
Paul S. Otellini
Yes. Yes it hasn’t change and yes that was our view at the time and I haven’t moved from there. 
John Barton - Cowen & Company
Great. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Feeney from FTN Midwest is next. 
Joanne Feeney - FTN Midwest Securities
Just one last question on the spending side of the budget, with the restructuring that you are completing now, can we expect that to bring down in absolute terms your research and your selling budgets, or is that likely to remain flat -- 
Stacy J. Smith
Our long-term goals haven’t changed, which is to grow spending at a rate that’s slower than revenue and have an expanding operating margin. In terms of the absolute spending level, that’s going to be to a large extent dependent on the revenue environment that we are in. But the long-term goals here are the same that I communicated to you a month ago -- it’s grow operating margin percent and have spending grow slower than revenue. 
Joanne Feeney - FTN Midwest Securities
And would you say that after the restructuring, you feel like you have more -- when conditions change, you are able to reduce those variable costs a bit more quickly than in the past?
Stacy J. Smith
Could you repeat that question? There’s a little bit of feedback on the line. 
Joanne Feeney - FTN Midwest Securities
Sorry about that. I was just wondering, given the restructuring, has the firm become a bit more nimble? I mean, if demand goes down, can you cut out some of these expenses fairly quickly?
Stacy J. Smith
There’s no question in my mind that we’ve become more nimble. I mean, if you -- the way we went about the restructuring and one of the reasons it’s taken some time to do it is we tried to address the underlying efficiency of the company, you know, the efficiency of our manufacturing organization, the efficiency of our research and development organization. There’s no question in my mind that we’ve addressed some of the underlying efficiency and frankly it’s a focus that we will continue over the course of time, even after the restructuring program that we announced two years ago goes away. I think it’s an incredible competitive tool for us. 
Joanne Feeney - FTN Midwest Securities
And that $250 million that we should expect this quarter, you said it was likely to reduce over the course of the year. Is that something you are going to wind up you think this year or should that continue into next year as well?
Stacy J. Smith
We will continue to focus on efficiency and productivity hopefully forever. In terms of the restructuring program and the pretty significant charges you’ve been seeing hitting the restructuring line, I think they drop off pretty dramatically when we get into the second half of the year. 
Joanne Feeney - FTN Midwest Securities
Okay. Thanks very much. 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman with American Technology Research. 
Doug Freedman - American Technology Research
You know, you’ve answered almost everything here but if you could, Stacy, talk a little bit about the impact of the Euro. You mentioned that it’s impacting OpEx but are there any benefits from the exchange rates that you are seeing and not just the Euro, but anything that you can offer there?
Stacy J. Smith
Yeah, absolutely. So on the spending, as you mentioned, it’s -- the weaker dollar is increasing our cost in some of the other geographies of the world. Two jobs ago I was actually the head for Europe, Middle East, and Africa and one of my rules of thumb is the best time to be in that region is when the dollar is weak and the time to leave is when the dollar becomes strong because it does lower the PC prices in the marketplace. And I think that’s part of the strength that Paul alluded to in Q4 as we are just seeing the price of technology coming down in Europe because a lot of components are priced in dollars. 
Doug Freedman - American Technology Research
And then can you talk about if you’ve seen any impact from what’s happening in the commodities market and whether that is having an impact, expected to have an impact and how you are working that into your thinking?
Stacy J. Smith
I’d say it’s the same as what we see on the macroeconomic side of the business. It’s one of the inputs that goes into how we look at the business and how we look at our costs, but in general what we are seeing, and I think this is as a result of our technology leadership right now and the strength of our products, we’re seeing a pretty strong market and I see costs coming down quarter by quarter by quarter, so those are kind of the two components there. 
Doug Freedman - American Technology Research
And then lastly, you know, you talked about success of ATOM happening and you’ve talked about strength in the server market and the drivers there. You also talked at the analyst day about the mix there being very important for gross margins going forward. Any help you can offer on how quick you think the ATOM class processors are going to ramp in comparison to sort of where we are seeing pretty strong strength in the server market now? Is this something where the mix is going to become more of an issue of 2009? Anything you can offer there. 
Stacy J. Smith
Yeah, sure. Too early to call. My view hasn’t change from what I showed you a month ago. We are pretty excited about the level of interest we are seeing on ATOM. I think it is driving some incremental strength but we are also seeing strength in the server business, so -- 
Paul S. Otellini
But I think it’s fair to say that the 57% gross margin for the year you are projecting includes the impact of ATOM for 2008. 
Stacy J. Smith
Yes. If that was your question, absolutely. 
Doug Freedman - American Technology Research
Okay. 
R. Kevin Sellers
Doug, real quickly -- Denise, we just need to take one more question because we are running out of time here and it needs to be a quick one. If you can just pull the next, last one and we’ll wind up the call. 
Operator
Yes, sir. Your next question comes from the line of John Lau from Jefferies & Company. 
John Lau - Jefferies & Company
Great. Thank you very much. Most of the questions have been answered but in terms of the underlying dynamics for the PC, Paul, much of the growth is outside the United States now. Does the outsourcing trend and the infrastructure build-out in the emerging market still look strong? And is that really the dynamics that we are looking for to offset more of the mature markets in the United States and Europe?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, to your first approximation, yeah, most of the growth over the next few years, five years, is going to be -- will be non-U.S. but the U.S. market has been pretty resilient based upon the transition to notebooks. People buy them more frequently than they do desktops and there’s more notebooks per person, et cetera. So I wouldn’t necessarily write it off. I think a notebook is becoming a bit of a fashion statement and that has a cache associated with it and we are seeing some of that. You have certainly seen that with the Apple product line growth. 
But I really think the unknown dynamic is what happens when these $200 to $300 Netbooks are unleashed in India and China and Indonesia and we don’t -- there is no model for that at this point in time because you are dealing with something that’s never existed before. 
So we are optimistic but we just don’t know at this point. 
John Lau - Jefferies & Company
And even before the ATOM hits those emerging markets, Paul, are you seeing -- what can you comment with regard to the adoption rate for the middle class and the general population with regard to Notebooks in these emerging markets now? Have you seen an up-tick there?
Paul S. Otellini
Yeah, it is and some of that is also back to Stacy’s last question on the dollar, I mean, as the dollar weakens against most currencies, particularly in some of these emerging markets, the amount of money it takes to buy a PC relative to local disposable income is less and less. And so we are seeing PC penetration move more rapidly in some of these markets than we had seen in previous years. 
And that’s one of the reasons you see us pointing to a growth forecast in terms of low double-digits for the units this year. 
John Lau - Jefferies & Company
Great. Thank you very much.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the fourth quarter 2007 Intel Corporation earnings conference call. My name is Akia and I’ll be your Operator for today. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today’s call, Mr. Kevin Sellers, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir. 
Kevin Sellers
Thank you and welcome, everyone to Intel's Q4 2007 earnings conference call. Joining me on today’s call are Chief Executive Officer Paul Otellini and Chief Financial Officer, Stacy Smith. As usual, Paul will be discussing the highlights of the quarter and the year and Stacy will then provide more details on our financial performance in Q4, as well as the business outlook for the first quarter and full year 2008. Following Stacy’s comments, we’ll be happy to take questions. 
A few important items before I turn it over to Paul -- first, we posted our earnings release and updated financial statements to our investor, intc.com, for anyone who still needs access to that information. Also, if during this call we use any non-GAAP financial measures or references, we will post the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliations to our website as well. 
Next, a replay of today’s call will be posted on our website at around five o’clock Pacific Time and will remain there for approximately two months. 
Lastly, we have scheduled our annual analyst investor day on March 5th and 6th at Intel headquarters in Santa Clara. We look forward to seeing many of you there. Our quiet period for the first quarter will therefore begin at the end of business Friday, March 7th. 
As we begin, let me remind everyone that today’s discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. 
So with that, let me now hand it over to Paul.
Paul S. Otellini
Thanks, Kevin and thank you all for joining us today. The fourth quarter capped a very strong 2007 for Intel. We returned to annual growth with revenues up over 8% and operating income up over 45% for the year. We achieved our goals of regaining product leadership across our entire product line and of becoming leaner and more efficient overall. 
With our tick-tock strategy working superbly, we exit 2007 with the strongest combination of products, manufacturing, and silicon technology leadership in our history. 
We have reinvented the transistor with our new Hi-K metal gate formula and are pleased to note that the initial ramp of our 45-nanometer process exceeds that of our 65-nanometer process. We now have over 30 products launched and shipping in high volume based on this new technology. 
As we look at the fourth quarter results specifically, we continued to benefit from strong demand for our processors and chipsets. ASPs were firm and costs continued to decline, contributing to an expansion in our gross margins of about seven percentage points from Q3. 
Now let me touch briefly on each of our major business segments. Our server business had a great fourth quarter as we shipped a record number of processors. We experienced strong double-digit revenue growth in the fourth quarter, both on a sequential basis as well as year over year reflecting the strength of our quad core Xeon processor family. 
Our new core microarchitecture MP platform called Caneland exceeded our ramp and conversion targets for the quarter. 
Mobile unit growth continues to be very strong and consistent with the shift to mobility we’ve seen over the past couple of years. Processor and chipset units both set a record in the quarter. As mobile continues to grow as a fraction of the PC market, system price points have expanded to include new lower prices consistent with consumer purchase capabilities. 
We are participating in these price points today with a variant of our core microarchitecture and will be adding versions of Silverthorne later this year to address even lower price points with good margins. 
This is a trend for which we have been planning and believe it’s a net positive for us as the mobile segment continues to grow. 
Our recent launch of new 45-nanometer mobile processors begins the transition of our entire mobile lineup to this technology, which will span from the highest performing laptops to the very lowest cost ones, allowing us to extend our lead in performance, power, and cost in this critically important segment. 
Our desktop business continued to build on the strength we showed last quarter. Our desktop quad core product shipments grew more than 40% from the third quarter, which helped to fortify ASPs in this competitive segment. 
Our chipset business continued to see strong growth during the quarter. Units grew from the third quarter, setting a record and grew sharply from a year ago. Our business continued to be strong and grew from a year ago across all of our major business segments. 
Our channel business also saw record shipments for the quarter, with servers and mobile microprocessors showing particular strength. Overall, channel inventories appear healthy and in line with our expectations as we head into Q1. 
Our flash businesses had a challenging quarter. NOR units declined sequentially even though ASPs increased. Our NAND business continues to ramp with revenue higher in the third quarter on sharply higher unit sales. The NAND competitive environment was worse than anticipated, causing ASPs to decline significantly from the third quarter. 
We plan to close the Numonyx transaction in the first quarter of 2008, something Stacy will address in his remarks momentarily. 
In closing, we are very pleased with the significant progress we made on our strategic objectives during 2007. We enter the new year leaner and stronger. Our tick-tock strategy continues to differentiate our products and technology. Our business is growing and our financial results are rewarding. 
We remain optimistic about 2008 and we enter the new year confident and motivated to build on the successes of ’07. 
Let me now turn the call over to Stacy for a detailed look at our financial performance as well as our business outlook for Q1 and full 2008. Stacy. 
Stacy J. Smith
Thanks, Paul. 2007 was not only a year of bringing great products and process technology to the market -- it was also a year in which our commitment to efficiency and spending control enabled the country to grow operating profit significantly faster than revenue. 
Compared to 2006, revenue grew 8% and with gross profit up and operating expenses down, operating profit was up 45% year over year. We exited the year with an operating income margin of over 28%. 
Revenue for the fourth quarter was a record at $10.7 billion, a 6% increase over the third quarter and below seasonal growth patterns following a strong third quarter. Computing related products and NOR Flash met expectations, while NAND Flash fell short. 
The quarterly revenue growth came from nearly all product lines -- microprocessors with a combination of record units, record revenue, and flat average selling prices, were a significant contributor. We saw double-digit unit growth in server and mobile microprocessors. Flash revenues grew in both NOR and NAND product lines. 
Fourth quarter revenue was up 10.5% year over year. Growth was driven by all geographies with particular strength in Europe. We achieved full year revenue and unit records in server and mobile microprocessors, chipsets, and wireless. 
Gross margin at 58% was up nearly seven percentage points from the third quarter. Gross profit dollars were $6.2 billion, up 27% from the third quarter and up 29% from the same quarter a year ago. 
The increase quarter to quarter was driven by approximately three points from lower unit costs and one point each from higher CPU volume from 45-nanometer product qualifying for sale in the fourth quarter and being classified as inventory, from lower start-up costs and from the Transmeta settlement charge taken in Q3. 
Gross margin was one point higher than the midpoint of our forecast based on lower-than-expected start-up costs and an overall Intel product mix slightly richer than expected. 
In a year-to-year comparison, gross margin percentage is eight-and-a-half points higher than the gross margin in Q4 2006. The vast majority of this increase is due to decreasing cost in our CPU business. 
We continued to reduce spending as a percentage of revenue during the quarter. R&D and MG&A were $2.9 billion, a little higher than in the third quarter and within the forecast range that we provided in October. On an annual basis, spending of $11.2 billion was down $800 million from 2006. 
In 2007, our structure and efficiency efforts yielded about $2.5 billion of efficiency, exceeding our plan to save $2 billion by the end of 2007. Our spending as a percent of revenue declined by nearly 500 basis points over the course of the year, from 34% in 2006 to 29% in 2007. 
We ended the year with approximately 86,000 employees, down 8% from a year ago and down 14% from the end of 2005. 
Restructuring costs in the quarter were approximately $230 million, $100 million higher than our expectation, primarily due to an impairment related to assets, which we plan to sell in conjunction with the divestiture of our NOR Flash memory business. The impairment is based on the revised value we expect to receive when the deal closes. 
On the balance sheet, inventory declined during the quarter by approximately $170 million to $3.4 billion. The quarterly decline in inventory includes a reduction of NOR inventory of approximately $200 million that has been classified as held for sale and is now presented under other current assets. 
Total cash investments, comprised of cash, short-term investments, and fixed income trading assets, ended the quarter at $14.9 billion, an increase of $2.3 billion from the third quarter. Net cash provided by operating activities accounted for the increase. 
During the quarter, stock repurchases were $1.5 billion, capital spending was $1.3 billion, and dividend payments were $660 million. 
As we turn now to the outlook for the first quarter and the full year, please keep in mind that unless specified, the forecasts do not include the effects of any new acquisitions, divestitures, or similar transactions that may be completed after January 14th. 
Consistent with our plan to close the Numonyx transaction in the first quarter, we have included NOR Flash in our forecast for consolidated results for Q1. However, our full year forecast does not include a forecast for NOR Flash for the rest of the year since we assume that the transaction will have closed in Q1. 
I will use a midpoint of forecast ranges when making comparisons to specific periods. 
We are planning for revenue in the first quarter to be between $9.4 billion and $10 billion. The midpoint of this range would be a 10% increase compared to the first quarter of 2007 and a sequential decline of 9%. Although this is well within the wider historical range for the period, the decline is more than the average seasonal decline of 7%. 
Our expectation for gross margin percentage in the first quarter is 56% plus or minus a couple of points. This is down two percentage points from the fourth quarter and is driven by new 65-nanometer chipset products that will not have qualified for sale in the first quarter and lower CPU units in the seasonally down first quarter. 
Spending on R&D plus MG&A is forecasted to be $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion, 3% lower than the fourth quarter due to a reduction in profit and revenue dependent expenses. 
In addition, in a separate category for restructuring and asset impairment charges, we expect expense of approximately $100 million. 
Depreciation is forecasted to be approximately $1.1 billion. Our estimate for gains and losses from equity investments and interest and other income is a net gain of $175 million. 
Looking ahead to the full year, we are planning for gross margin percentage to be 57% plus or minus a few points. The five percentage point increase from 2007 is due to lower unit cost of computing related products and, to a lesser extent, the divestiture of lower margin businesses. 
R&D and MG&A is expected to be $11.4 billion, up 2% from 2007 as process development engineers transition from 45-nanometer startup activities to 32-nanometer development, causing a movement of spending from cost of sales to R&D, as we would typically see in the year following a process qualification. 
We are targeting overcall capital spending at $5.2 billion plus or minus $200 million, up $200 million from 2007. 
For research and development in 2008, we plan to spend approximately $5.9 billion, a modest increase from the $5.8 billion we spent in 2007 and inclusive of the approximately $200 million movement from cost of sales to R&D. 
Depreciation for the year is forecasted to be $4.4 billion plus or minus $100 million, down from $4.5 billion in 2007. 
The estimated tax rate for 2008 is 31%. 
As Paul said, we exit 2007 with the strongest combination of products, silicon technology and manufacturing leadership in our history and the fourth quarter results reflect this leadership, as well as the progress the company has made towards improving cost and efficiency, resulting in an increase in operating profit of 105% from the fourth quarter of 2006. And although there is uncertainty in the global economy, we are planning for another year of growth where profits grow faster than revenue and where our investments in products, silicon technology, and manufacturing leadership continue to generate competitive advantage. 
With that, let me turn it over to Kevin for Q&A. 
Kevin Sellers
Thanks, Stacy. Akia, we’d now like to open the call for questions and answers. Thanks. 
Question-and-Answer Session

Operator
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of David Wong of Wachovia. Please proceed. 
David Wong - Wachovia
Thanks very much. Could you help us understand your gross margin full year guidance please? Because you are saying that for the last three quarters of the year, you are not including Numonyx, so that actually helps increase gross margin somewhat. If you start off at 56%, are you reckoning roughly the same gross margin on microprocessors through the year or does it improve through the year?
Stacy J. Smith
Let me help you by doing a year-over-year comparison in gross margins going from 52% -- going from, sorry, 2007 to 2008 where you see a five point increase to the 57%. What you see there is that the unit cost improvements are the majority of the increase year over year. We do see some impact of the divestitures of the lower margin business but that’s frankly in the realm of a point or a point-and-a-half. So the vast majority of the improvement is the unit cost increase. 
We are not giving a quarter-by-quarter forecast but you can kind of do the math and get to the first half, second half, understanding that the Numonyx transaction is expected to close in Q1 and is outside the forecast after that. 
David Wong - Wachovia
Right. One other quick one related to that then -- would you expect the percentage of your four-way server revenues as a portion of total sales revenues will rise through the year, enriching the mix in servers?
Paul S. Otellini
I would expect that quad-core will continue to grow as a percent of our Xeon shipments, yes. 
David Wong - Wachovia
But multi-processor versus duo-processor?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, we are just starting to ramp the Caneland version of the quad-core platform now, as I said in my comments, and that product is on a fairly steep ramp and we have new products coming in over the course of the year. 
We began retaking our share in servers, in duo-processors over the course of last year, 2007, and now you are seeing us make some good in-roads back into the MP market. 
David Wong - Wachovia
Great. Thanks very much. 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Please proceed. 
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
Just kind of curious on the March quarter revenue guidance; the below seasonality after a Q4 that was also below seasonality, and also the prospect of you guys gaining share with some of your new product suites, is this a reflection of you guys being prudent relative to the macro environment? Or are you actually seeing forecasts from your customers that would indicate a below seasonal Q1?
Stacy J. Smith
Let me actually start this by stating what happened in Q4 and then I’ll segment into how we see Q1. 
In Q4, what we saw was that the computing related products actually grew as we expected, roughly seasonally on the back of a very strong third quarter. So the computing related segment of the business came in as expected. The part that caused us to be a little bit below the midpoint was that the NAND pricing environment was quite a bit worse than we expected when we set the forecast for the quarter.
As we go into Q1, there’s a variety of small factors, no one of which I’d say is significant but the combination of these has us a little bit conservative, a little bit cautious as we look at the first quarter. 
We see that NAND pricing will probably continue to be weak, so that’s a piece of it. We had some supply agreements in place to provide supply to Marvell as part of the sale of our business to them. We saw some of that revenue go away in Q4 and more goes away in Q1, so that exacerbates seasonality a little bit.
Based on what we see and economic indicators, we think it’s right to be a little bit cautious as we go into the year. And you’ve got NOR that’s in our results now for the first quarter. NOR tends to have exacerbated seasonality Q4 to Q1, so that moves our seasonality a little bit from what we thought. 
So several small things, no one of which is significant but the combination of those has us a little cautious as we start the quarter. 
You have to keep in mind it’s 10% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1 on top of 10% revenue growth year over year in Q4, so we think the business continues to grow. 
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
Stacy, one thing you didn’t mention was just the PC revenue stream. Is that coming in about seasonal relative to these other adjustments? And I guess the other question would be did you see any cancellations at the end of Q4 that would make you more cautious about Q1?
Stacy J. Smith
The CPU business is [roughly] seasonal when you look at the unit volume that we expect in the first quarter. We saw demand grow through the fourth quarter. We didn’t see anything unusual in terms of cancellations and we didn’t see anything unusual in terms of inventory building up. 
Our inventory is lower than I’d like. The disti channel inventory that we have visibility into is at the low end, so it all felt pretty healthy through the fourth quarter. 
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
Thanks, guys. 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Uche Orji. Please proceed. 
Uche Orji - UBS
Thank you very much. Let me just start by asking about restructuring. Are we done with restructuring in 2008? And is there any way of characterizing the operational leverage we can get beyond ’08?
Stacy J. Smith
So we’re definitely not done until I close the Numonyx transaction, that’s for sure. When we embarked on the restructuring program, as we’ve discussed, it was envisioned as a two-year program. We are not providing a full year forecast for restructuring dollars but I think I can give you some directional comments. 
I do expect that I’ll have some restructuring costs in the second quarter and I think it tails off to be a pretty small amount by the time we get into the second half of the year. 
The big action left to happen for us is the closing of the Numonyx transaction. We’ve got a couple of smaller factory things going on but the lion’s share of what is left to do is closing the Numonyx transaction for us. 
Uche Orji - UBS
Just one more question; you mentioned Europe as being strong in the fourth quarter but we have picked up [reports], Dickson’s profit warning and some retail sales numbers in Germany, some slowing in Western Europe. Is there any way for us to characterize the channel inventory and just put it all in context as to what we could expect going forward? Because I mean, if Europe was strong in Q4, if you think we are seeing some slowing now so it is possible that from here onwards, we -- I know you are cautious in your guidance but can you just tell us what you are seeing with regard to specifically channel inventory in Europe and also in Asia? We’ve also heard comments about channel inventory building in Asia, so if you could just address that, that would be helpful. 
Paul S. Otellini
Okay, well first of all just on Europe, we had a very strong quarter in Europe. It was up 22% sequentially and our customer reports in terms of sales our there are very strong, and including the stuff we’ve received most recently in the first part of January. 
So so far, we’ve not seen any significant signs of slow down in Europe or anywhere else, for that matter. There’s some bits and pieces of information out there, like the Dickson’s commentary that you mentioned, but I think we all haven’t really internalized what that may mean in terms of which vendors and which market share and so forth. 
In terms of channel inventory, I can only speak to our inventory, our distributor inventory in the channel. On a worldwide basis, that’s in very good shape. It’s actually down a little bit from the prior quarter and that’s at a point in time when we are trying to replenish that with 45-nanometer product. So if anything, I’d like to try and get that up a little bit just like I would like to try and get our internal inventories up a little bit. 
In terms of our customers and downstream inventories, I haven’t heard any problems. You should really ask them about that though. 
Uche Orji - UBS
Okay. Just one last question, please; does the guidance for gross margins for the full year include an expectation that inventories will go up? And could you just tell us what level of inventory you are comfortable with?
Stacy J. Smith
You know, we get this question periodically, pretty much every quarter. We don’t give a forecast for inventory that goes out past the next quarter. For Q1, I am hoping to actually get a little bit more of the new products into inventory. We’ve qualified products on 45-nanometer, which is Penryn, so I’d like to have a little more headroom there and get ahead of the demand curve that we are seeing. 
If I go out over the course of the rest of the year, it’s going to be dependent on a lot of different factors, so I won’t be able to forecast beyond Q1. But Q1 I would actually like to grow it a little bit. 
I do see seasonal patterns in inventory, so you can kind of look at that and get an idea. I’m not seeing anything for 2008 that would lead me to be different than what you’d normally see of build ahead for the big selling seasons, but it’s too early to call. 
Uche Orji - UBS
Great. Thanks. 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs
Good evening. Thanks so much. I would like to revisit the margin question and just understand relative to sort of the pro forma guidance for the first quarter. If I look like for like over the course of the year, we know there’s some positive impacts to gross margins, including mix shift toward higher end and what should be fully loaded factories relative to the inventory rebuild. 
So what are the negative offsets to margins that are keeping the sequential guidance? I understand the year-over-year margin guidance is very -- or the margin improvement is strong but what are the negative offsets that are keeping the sequential margin guidance flattish as we go throughout the year?
Stacy J. Smith
So let me answer that. I’ll give you the insight I can into Q1 margin guidance but again, I’m not going to give out quarter-by-quarter margin forecasts. 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs
I’m sorry, just -- I don’t necessarily want a forecast but what are the negative offsets that are keeping the full year guidance from meaningfully higher than the Q1 guidance?
Stacy J. Smith
In Q1, what we see is that we have some product that we are building ahead on chipsets that will be pre-qualification. We see CPU unit volume being seasonally down. I think as I work my way through the course of the year, if I’m 56% in Q1 and I’m 57% for the year and I’ve got some of this that is a divestiture that’s to happen, what you see is actually a pretty flattish gross margin if you just kind of average it across the year at a reasonable rate. 
So I’m not going to give you a quarter-by-quarter forecast but the improvement that we are seeing right now is based on cost and I think that cost improvement continues over the course of 2008. 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs
And I’m sorry, I’ll just ask one more time -- if the cost improvement continues and there should be positive mix shift, what are the things that are offsetting that for the full year?
Stacy J. Smith
As I look at the full year, I see some good news based on cost improvement, I see some good news based on divestitures. I don’t have negatives that are hidden in that margin forecast. 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs
So how come it’s not higher for the full year then?
Stacy J. Smith
It is the gross margin forecast that we have for 2008. 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs
Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri of Merrill Lynch. Please proceed. 
Srini Pajjuri - Merrill Lynch
Thank you. Stacy, can you comment on pricing? I mean, I’m just assuming that, you know, looking at your gross margin forecast, there are obviously some negatives as we move into the next few quarters. Is it all pricing related or is it mix related? 
And given that you are so early into the 45-nanometer ramp, I would have expected you to see some more unit cost benefits and it looks like you are not going to see some, so I’m just curious as to what is going on there. 
Stacy J. Smith
We are not going to give a pricing forecast for the year. Our expectation as we start the year is that it’s kind of similar to what we’ve seen over the last couple of quarters. We have product leadership that helps inoculate us a bit at the high end and there’s competition that impacts us kind of the mid range of our stack and down. 
But I’d say it’s pretty similar to what we’ve seen over the last couple of quarters and Paul talked about what we are seeing in the mobile segment as that becomes a bigger percentage of the business. 
Srini Pajjuri - Merrill Lynch
Okay, and then as we move into Q2, obviously you are assuming that you exit the NOR business and historically, I think you did about flat to down 2% or so, so I’m just -- I don’t have a good idea as to how big your NOR business is and any thoughts on how we should model it for Q2?
Stacy J. Smith
In terms of gross margin?
Srini Pajjuri - Merrill Lynch
No, just the revenues. 
Stacy J. Smith
Oh, in terms of revenues? We don’t typically break out NOR from NAND. We give you a segment for the memory business. We actually took away that segment this quarter in anticipation that the Numonyx deal would have closed and it actually becomes a much less important driver of our business. 
If we still had that segment, so consolidated results for NOR and NAND, what you’d see from Q3 to Q4 is that revenue grew a little bit from 553 to 586. Paul gave you the elements of that. The NOR units are down a bit. ASP is stronger based on increase in density. We are seeing the NAND business ramping, pricing coming down. But I won’t break out the NOR results specifically there but in terms of the full year gross margin, once we’ve taken the Numonyx transaction and it’s closed, it’s a point to a point-and-a-half of gross margin for the year, for the rest of the year. 
Srini Pajjuri - Merrill Lynch
Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Danely of J.P. Morgan. Please proceed.
Chris Danely - J.P. Morgan
Thanks, guys. Stacy, just one last quick question on gross margins -- so if we strip the Flash effects, it looks like your Q4 of ’08 gross margin should be roughly similar to Q4 of ’07. So should we assume that this is your peak gross margin or could it go higher than that? Can you just comment on that a little bit?
Stacy J. Smith
Sure. It could go higher, it could go lower. I feel really good about the progress we are making on the cost side. I feel good about the progress we are making on divesting some of the lower margin businesses. 
The key element that could cause it to be higher and could cause it to be lower is what is the pricing environment and that’s really a function of the strength of our product roadmap relative to competition. I think we are starting the year in a pretty good spot but that’s the thing that could swing it up or swing it down. 
Chris Danely - J.P. Morgan
Okay, and then as my follow-up, I know it’s pretty far out there but can you just comment on what you expect depreciation and start-up cost trends to do in 2009 versus 2008, either up or down?
Stacy J. Smith
No, I wouldn’t hazard a forecast for 2009. At the analyst meeting in March, we’ll give you, as we typically do, some longer term trends in terms of costs and where our capital is going and so you will be able to derive some of that, but I’m not going to do that now. 
Chris Danely - J.P. Morgan
Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. 
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Thanks. Looking at the mobility group, it looks like your notebook CPU business slowed a bit in its quarterly growth and year over year, but the operating income actually increased pretty nicely. Can you just give us a little color behind what’s happening there?
Stacy J. Smith
Sure, I’ll give you a little bit. You know, I think Paul gave you a lot of it actually in his speech, so if you look at the mobile processing segment, what you saw was double-digit unit growth. We continue to see the shifts towards mobility, but as notebook becomes a larger and larger percentage of the TAM and we expect a crossover point some time in 2009 where it’s -- you know, as it grows that you see it moving into emerging markets and more price sensitive segments of the market. And so that’s a little more competitive pricing that leads to unit growth that we think is very beneficial to us. So that’s specifically on the notebook processor segment. 
You also see in that segment the impact of what I was talking about with the Marvell supply agreement. That started to come down a little bit in Q4. It will come down more in Q1 so that’s part of what’s driving our Q4 to Q1 seasonality. 
And then on the positive side, you see a variety of things but the biggest single item is just the cost reduction we are achieving quarter on quarter. That drives the operating margin results in that segment. You had a little bit for some other issues like start-up costs coming down and things like that but the lion’s share of that is just cost improving. 
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
So the ASPs in that segment came down mainly because of the mix? Is it fair to assume then that the ASPs in the server and the desktop side of things must have offset that to the positive to get that slack you talked about?
Paul S. Otellini
I did say that ASPs were firm and about flat, so you can do the math from that. 
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Okay, and then I guess as a follow-up and somewhat unrelated, on the CapEx side of things, that rising year over year, can you just talk a little bit about where that spending is going to take place?
Stacy J. Smith
Well, what drives our CapEx spending is going to be the build-out of the 45-nanometer factory network. You’ve got a little bit of 32-nanometer actually in there at the end of the year. Again, I’ll show you more of that at the Spring analyst meeting. 
You would expect in the year following a process qualification that you’d have a big year from CapEx spending. We actually see this number as being a little bit below what you’d normally expect based on the progress we’ve made in improving utilizations and efficiency. I don’t want to steal all the thunder because I’ll go through quite a bit of this at the analyst meeting but kind of hidden under the numbers here, we’ve increased the peak that we are building for in 45-nanometer and we are doing it with less capital than we originally anticipated. And I’ll show you some of that in a few weeks. 
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Great. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Sumit Dhanda of Banc of America. Please proceed. 
Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America
Stacy, I had a question for you on the divestiture of the Flash business. Am I correct in assuming that there’s a benefit to SG&A and R&D which is reflected in your full year forecast, mainly in the last three quarters of the year? And how should we, if you can give any guidance, think about modeling the [one line] consolidation post the divestiture?
Stacy J. Smith
Yes, for all of the annual forecast numbers I gave you, it assumes that the NOR business is part of our consolidated results in the first quarter and then not part of the consolidated results Q2, Q3, Q3. 
The impact of that is you’ll see the revenue come out, you’ll see gross margin get a little bit better, we’ve talked about that. You will see a minor impact to SG&A and then we’ll pick up on a one quarter lag the gain or loss from Numonyx, but it’s going to be outside the consolidated operating profit results of the company. So it will be in the EPS but not in the consolidated operating profit results. 
Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America
Okay, good. And a quick follow-up; the factors you cited for your Q1 guidance being a little below seasonal -- weak pricing in NAND, the Marvell supply agreement, NOR seasonality, and then the economic forecast -- could you sort of break out or rank order the drivers for the impact versus a down 7% seasonally normal quarter?
Stacy J. Smith
Given that we are kind of inside a wide range of seasonality, albeit at the low end, you are getting into some pretty some impacts -- again, no one of which is super significant. It’s the combination of those that has me a little cautious as we start that first quarter. 
So if you are asking is it concerns about the computing related segment that’s really driving that, it’s not. It’s a variety of factors, with macroeconomics being one of them but other more specific factors being part of it as well. 
Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America
Okay. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung of Citigroup. Please proceed. 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
Thanks. Stacy, you gave us guidance, full year guidance for gross margins -- what’s the underlying assumption about the PC industry that you have to help you to give that guidance? And within that, do you think Intel is going to be above or below that, or gaining share within that forecast?
Stacy J. Smith
I’ll actually kick that one over to Paul. 
Paul S. Otellini
Let me give Stacy a break here. We’re assuming -- well, let me back up. Most of the industry analysts have PC unit volume growing in the low double digits in ’08 over ’07. That is an assumption we wouldn’t argue with and that’s one that we are building our capacity plans around. 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
Okay. All right, low double digits, okay. And then when you -- actually, let me ask this question and unfortunately, Paul, it’s for Stacy; the tax rate was a little bit higher than we thought. Can you give us the outlook for the tax rate in ’08 and what we should be modeling for that?
Stacy J. Smith
I think I gave you the tax rate for ’08 of 31%. What we saw in Q4 was a little bit of a shift, so we were a little higher than our forecast in Q4. It was a little bit of a shift to taxable income in higher tax jurisdictions. 
You will see that the ’08 tax rate is quite a bit higher than 2007. You have to remember we had some one-time tax settlements in the first part of 2007 that has our 2007 rate pretty low. 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
Paul, I’m sorry, the other part of my first question was whether or not you thought Intel would be gaining share in your ’08 forecast. 
Paul S. Otellini
I don’t think I want to forecast that right now. We are -- I think our product line is solid and our capacity is, relative to our view of the market, unconstrained. So we’ll see how it sorts out over the course of the year. 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
Okay, thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Tim Luke of Lehman Brothers. Please proceed. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers 
Thanks. Stacy, in discussing the weakness of the NAND business the led you to be slightly below the midpoint of the guide, could you just frame for us what the impact was there and what’s the range of how much that may have been and how we may perceive that to be impacting the first quarter as well?
Stacy J. Smith
Well, I think you can do the math. I think I gave you all the pieces. In Q4, the computing related products and NOR Flash came in roughly in line with my expectations when I set the quarter. The miss was based on NAND and specifically the NAND pricing environment was quite a bit more challenging than we thought. 
As we go into Q1, again that’s a variety of factors. NAND pricing is one of them that has us at the lower end of the seasonal range that we’d expect. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers 
With respect to your OpEx guidance, it comes in for R&D and SG&A for the full year of calendar ’08 slightly above some of the street models in a period when you have been very focused on efficiency and cost reduction. Could you outline whether we should view those numbers as somewhat conservative and what the key areas of investment may be in terms of both R&D and SG&A?
Stacy J. Smith
I think that’s one I’ll save for the analyst day. We will go through in some detail the investment profile and investment in growth businesses versus core, so I’ll show you that then. 
We are up a little bit year-on-year but we also have this reclassification that we tend to see every couple of years of R&D heads that move from getting the process into production, which was 45-nanometer, to now doing pure R&D on 32-nanometer. That really accounts for the increase that we see year over year. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers

Thanks. I think most of my questions have been answered but just a quick one, just so we put it on the table before it comes up again later on in the week -- is there any double ordering whatsoever in your business that you can tell? 
Stacy J. Smith

Your next question comes from the line of John Lau of [Kessler]. Please proceed. 
John Lau - Kessler 
Great, thanks. Paul, you’ve given us a lot of the data points and I wanted to recap what you said -- the lower-than-normal seasonality for Q1 is based upon a lot of different factors but you remain unchanged with regard to a double digit consensus thought process for what the PC growth rate would be for 2008, am I correct on that?
Paul S. Otellini
Right, and Stacy said I think pretty clearly that our view of Q1 is not being clouded by a pessimistic view of computing. 
John Lau - Kessler 
And in terms of any other changes, I know you may have answered this but nothing has changed in terms of the fundamentals on the emerging markets or the U.S. to change your thought process this early in the year for that double-digit growth, is that correct?
Paul S. Otellini
That’s correct and if anything, I think this shift towards mobility continues to be one of the growth drivers of the industry and that is, as price points for notebooks come down, that tends to open up even more markets, on one side. 
The other side of this thing we didn’t talk much about was so far in the call is servers. We had an outstanding quarter and an outstanding year for servers and servers and notebooks go hand-in-hand. The servers are building the infrastructure for the Internet and the enterprise and the notebooks are essentially becoming the clients to view those on. And the combination we think is very powerful and is not showing any signs of diminishing. 
John Lau - Kessler 
And that leads to a final segue to my last question and speaking specifically on servers, your competition had indicated that they were constrained and that may have led to a favorable, more favorable pricing environment. Do you see that continuing in Q1?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, I don’t know what their plans are. We’ll hear a little bit more later this week but what we are finding is customers are very satisfied with the products we are shipping, both of MP and DP and our volumes are growing very, very nicely. And you saw very clearly in the last couple of years that when server momentum changes in one direction, it tends to move in that direction for some time. I think the wind is at our back at this point. 
John Lau - Kessler 
Great. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis. Please proceed. 
Mark Lipacis - Prudential

Maybe a question for Stacy -- at IDF, you guys showed a chart of forecasted microprocessor manufacturing unit cost by quarter, which I thought was quite helpful. Would you say that that chart is still a fair approximation of how you expect your microprocessor manufacturing costs to track for the year, or have your expectations and outlook for that cost structure changed? Thank you. 
Stacy J. Smith
We will update that chart for SAM that you’ll see in a few weeks, so I don’t think I’ll go through the year. If you look at what we are seeing in the first quarter, what you see is a slight increase in CPU cost as we ramp the 45-nanometer process that was exactly as we predicted at the Spring analyst meeting last year. It’s offset by the fact that our chipset cost is better based on a variety of factors but running full factories is certainly a part of it. 
So yes, I think that the Q1 cost trend that we are seeing is directionally the same as what we showed you. We are starting the year with probably a little better cost momentum than I was anticipating and we’ll update that when we get to the spring analyst meeting in a few weeks. 
Mark Lipacis - Prudential

Great, thanks. Very helpful.

Your next question comes from the line of Cody Acree of Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed. 
Cody Acree - Stifel Nicolaus

Thanks. The part of the mobile ASPs, obviously emerging market growth has been very strong. To what extent does the rapid growth of these emerging markets has any impact on your overall view in ’08 or maybe even into ’09 for PC revenue growth?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, it’s a bit part of it. I think that -- for example, this last quarter in Q4, Asia-Pacific and Japan hit both records. Now, Japan is not an emerging market but Asia-Pacific is a pretty good surrogate for that and sales in China continue to boom and I think with the Olympics coming on this year, it’s going to be even a better year for electronics in China. 
Cody Acree - Stifel Nicolaus
I guess what I was trying to get to is do you get to a point where we are getting some diminishing returns where the mobile prices are falling so rapidly that we are not outrunning that unit growth?
Paul S. Otellini
No, I don’t see that happening, number one. Number two, mobile ASPs are still better than desktop ASPs no matter what you do here. They are always going to be above them. 
And then I alluded to it in my comments, one of the things we are excited about is embracing this trend with a new product line aimed at this, which is aimed for lower cost notebooks based upon Silverthorne. And that allows us to take pricing down even farther, to take the bill of materials down for these machines lower and make very good margins because our costs are substantially lower than the existing products that we ship into these things. 
So having a tailored product for ultra low cost notebooks, if I could invent that phrase, is a first for us and I’m very excited about it. 
Cody Acree - Stifel Nicolaus
And then lastly, Paul, you made specific remarks to macroeconomic concerns but it sounds like everything within the PC space is relatively healthy. Is there anything with the general electronics and technology that you can point to that you’ve keyed in on in the last few months that’s giving you specific pause? Or is it -- 
Paul S. Otellini
Well, actually I don’t think I said I have concerns -- I said I have the same caution that I think that everybody in America who watches CNBC has today. You hear all of the pundits saying that the world is going to go to a trash basket and you worry. It may be a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
At this point though, we don’t see anything on the horizon. Our customers don’t see anything on the horizon. I was at CES last week talking to people from all around the world and we just don’t see it. 
You have to remember that 75% of Intel's revenues are not in the United States and that’s where the bulk of the growth has been coming from. So if there’s a near term concern, I think it tends to be focused on the U.S. market, particularly on the U.S. capital markets, and our customers at least and we don’t see that bleeding over at this point in time. 
It would be imprudent not to be cautious about it though. 
Cody Acree - Stifel Nicolaus
Perfect. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Freedman of AMTECH Research. Please proceed. 
Douglas Freedman - American Technology Research
Thanks for taking my question. Paul, just to sort of dig into what you just mentioned a little bit deeper, would your plans change significantly if you did see macro effects start to hit your business, given the fact that it does look like you are spending more money and the R&D and SG&A spending also are calling for increases, when we had been under sort of more of a belt tightening mode?
Paul S. Otellini
Well, let me back up -- we’re not really growing our spending. Stacy talked about some structural changes in terms of dollars -- $200 million moving from cost of sales to R&D as we move from the natural part of the cycle of deployment of new silicon technology to R&D and the next generation of it. So that is the fundamental thing. 
But with the exception of things like foreign exchange, our spending is fundamentally flat below the line and pretty much across the board in terms of the company. 
We are on track to deliver that third billion dollars of overall structural efficiency program spending that we said we would do when we set the program in place a year-and-a-half, two years ago. We got over $2 billion this year and that third billion will come in -- in ’07, the third billion will come in 2008. 
So I just don’t see it. 
Douglas Freedman - American Technology Research
All right, and then could you talk a little bit about, you know, you do have the operating model back with its legs underneath it here, spitting out some pretty nice free cash flow. Can you talk about some of the uses that you see using for that? Or how should we think about buy-backs versus dividends versus other uses of that cash? 
Stacy J. Smith
And this is where we never help you as much as you want in terms of specific guidance. In the fourth quarter, I think it’s pretty indicative of our strategy. We did $1.5 billion worth of buy-back. We raised the dividend. We paid the dividend, so you are going to continue to see us use both ways to return cash to the shareholders over time. And beyond that, I won’t forecast for you a specific buy-back level for 2008 or for Q1. 
Douglas Freedman - American Technology Research
And then if I could just focus in quickly on some product ramps that I think are important for the year -- the notebook ramp on Montevina, can you give us an update how that’s going and expectations there? Also, any update you could on your products targeting the graphics market. 
Paul S. Otellini
Let me back up -- on Montevina, it is not shipping yet. We are on target to ship and launch systems in Q2, mid Q2 timeframe. That looks very good right now. All the silicon is solid and we are in production on all elements of it. And I want to reiterate, we are in high volume production across over 30 microprocessors now in 45-nanometers, so that process technology is very strong, including the mobile products. 
And the question on graphics please again?
Douglas Freedman - American Technology Research
If you could update us on product developments there and how that road map is looking, as you’ve mentioned Laramie in the past targeting that market. 
Paul S. Otellini
There’s two thrusts there. One is to significantly increase the performance of our integrated graphics line, our existing product line and you’ll see a bump in that product line in 2008 that takes the performance up substantially, and then a couple more bumps over the next couple of years. We are on track to deliver the 10X performance improvement in integrated graphics by 2010 and that’s in a fairly linear fashion from 2006 to 2010. 
Laramie first silicon should be late this year in terms of samples and we’ll start playing with it and sampling it to developers and I still think we are on track for a product in late ’09, 2010 timeframe. 
Douglas Freedman - American Technology Research
Great. Thank you for the detail.

Your last question comes from the line of David Wu of Global Crown Capital. Please proceed. 
David Wu - Global Crown Capital
I just have one question, Stacy; I think last quarter in the conference call, the first quarter assumption on X86 microprocessor was that since those products were produced in Q4 when the factories were full, the gross margin doesn’t take as much as big a dip as you normally would, offset by some additional 45-nanometer start-up expense. But it does look like your guidance is a bit lower than that. Is that a function of your fear on the NAND pricing situation or have things changed a bit on that theory that when you produce a product and it’s 90 days later, they become revenues. 
Stacy J. Smith
I don’t think we had forecasted the first quarter gross margin in the last call. 
David Wu - Global Crown Capital
Well, there was talk about the first quarter that you should not equate the unit volume shipments in the quarter with unit costs, because unit cost is determined by the prior quarter production. 
Stacy J. Smith
So that relationship still holds. That’s part of the good news to costs that we are seeing in Q4. It was volume that we started to produce in Q3 as the factories ramp towards full. I think we are still -- you will still see the same phenomenon in Q1. It’s offset a little bit in the CPU space by the fact that we have a higher mix of 45-nanometer wafers coming out at the early end of that process transition. As we typically see, those are a bit more expensive wafers so that causes a slight increase. That’s pretty much exactly as we had showed you at the spring analyst meeting last year. 
David Wu - Global Crown Capital
How much does the pricing pressure on NAND flash come into your guidance for Q1 gross margin? 
Stacy J. Smith
It will be a negligible impact on the gross margin in Q1. 
David Wu - Global Crown Capital
Okay. Thank you. 
Kevin Sellers
Before we close, what I would like to do, and thanks, David, for the question. I’m going to turn the time over to Paul for just some wrap-up comments and then Akia will close the call. Thanks. 
Paul S. Otellini
Thanks, Kevin. As we close out our call today I wanted to look ahead for just a moment. 2008 holds a promise of some significant milestones for Intel. First of all, it marks our 40th anniversary as a company -- 40 years of changing the world. In 2008, we plan to launch new products such as Canmore, targeted at consumer electronics, and Silverthorne, aimed at low-cost notebooks and mobile Internet devices. These products support our strategy to take Intel architecture and the technical breadth of 45-nanometers into new markets for Intel. 
2008 will also see the advent of WiMAX enabled notebooks. Towards the end of ’08, we plan to launch Nehalem, our next generation microarchitecture which brings significant changes and enhancements to our processor product line. 
Our results and position exiting ’07, coupled with our plans for 2008, give us optimism for another good year for the company. We look forward to sharing more of our results and plans with you as the year unfolds. We thank you all for joining our call today and we look forward to seeing many of you at our analyst day on March 5th and 6th here in Santa Clara. Good night.

Thanks, Kevin. Thank you all for joining us today. In thethird quarter Intel turned in very strong financial performance as we enjoyedrobust demand for our leading edge processors and chipsets. Not only was demandstrong overall, but it strengthened as the quarter progressed. The marketstrength was broad based, cutting across all geographies and business segments.Additionally, our strong product lineup allowed us to hold microprocessor ASPsflat sequentially.
A little over a year ago we laid out a three prong strategyto regain product leadership, leverage our world-class process technology andmanufacturing and restructure the company to become lean and efficient. We arepleased that our third quarter performance showed such strong gains inyear-over-year revenue and operating income, as this demonstrates thesignificant progress we've made in all three of our strategic objectives. Ourfocus going forward is to continue to improve on these pillars. 
Now let me take a minute and review each of our majorbusiness units. First I want to comment on quad-core. We launched our first quad-coreprocessor in November of last year, and by the second quarter had shipped ourfirst million units. With demand for our quad-core products accelerating, weshipped over 2 million units in the third quarter alone. We now offer over 20unique quad-core processor designs. 
In servers, we shipped a record number of units in the thirdquarter and enjoyed double-digit revenue gains over a year ago. We alsolaunched our first quad-core product designed for high end, multi processorservers which delivers twice the performance and three times the performanceper watt of our previous generation MP product. This introduction now completesIntel's transition to the core microarchitecture across all our product lines.
In mobile, we continue to see a shift to mobility withrevenues in this segment growing greater than 30% year over year, and 20%sequentially during the quarter. We are pleased with the acceptance of ourSanta Rosa platform and our Centrino brand continues to be widely accepted asthe brand of choice for notebook PCs.
In the desktop, both our consumer and corporate desktopproducts had very good performance this quarter with increases in units, ASPs,and revenues quarter over quarter and year over year. vPro, our brandedplatform offering for corporate desktops, is ramping extremely well and offerstruly unique and compelling value for IT managers. 
In chipsets we had a record unit and revenue quarter. As thequarter progressed, we saw chipset orders strengthen and we enter Q4 withconfidence of a strong demand environment. 
Our flash results improved sequentially. The NAND businesssaw an increase in revenue driven by increased densities, offset by lower unitvolumes. Our NOR business saw higher volumes, but lower ASPs.
Moving on to technology, I want to highlight a couple ofthings. First, we continue to be very pleased with the execution of ourmanufacturing network and its ability to respond rapidly to the demand upsidewe have seen. Our network of factories remains a strong source of competitivedifferentiation for us. 
Second, we have announced that on November 12 we will belaunching a new family of products based upon our break through High-k metalgate 45-nanometer process technology. We are excited about the advances we'rebringing to the market with this new process and believe this will extend evenfurther our technology leadership. 
In addition, we've demonstrated working silicon of our nextgeneration Nehalem microarchitecture which is booting multiple operatingsystems and is scheduled for production in the second half of 2008.
I would like to close with a mention about the unique valueof our platform strategy and what it brings to our customers. vPro is our PCplatform designed for corporate environments. We recently launched our secondgeneration platform called Weybridge for this segment and we are very pleasedwith its ramp and acceptance. The vPro platform is a terrific example of thebenefits we bring by offering our customers higher levels of integration. Bycombining processor, chipset and LAN we now have the ability to truly solvebusiness problems for the user; in this case, the IT manager. 
Security, manageability, and virtualization are most robustwhen implemented through an integrated platform. We are delighted with theprogress of our platform strategy as it continues to create incremental revenueopportunities for us and deliver increased benefits to end users. 
Let me now turn the call over to Andy for a detailed look atour financial performance as well as our business outlook for the fourthquarter. 
 Andy Bryant
Thanks, Paul. Higher revenue and improving productivitycombined in the third quarter to produce exceptional growth and profits. Therewas a marked acceleration of year to year growth in revenue and unusually highseasonal growth. Gross margin was higher both in absolute dollars and as apercent of revenue. Spending continued its downward trend as a percent ofrevenue and operating profits were up more than 60% from both the secondquarter of 2007 and the third quarter of 2006. Earnings per share for the sameperiods grew by 41%. We are expecting sequential revenue growth again in thefourth quarter and also double-digit year-to-year growth. 
With lower unit costs, a successful ramp of the 45-nanometermanufacturing process and good demand for our products, gross margin in thefourth quarter should be nearly 5 points higher than the third quarter and wehave raised our forecast for the full year. 
Revenue for the third quarter was $10.1 billion, upapproximately 16% from the second quarter of 2007 and 15% from the thirdquarter of 2006. The sequential growth in revenue is more than double theaverage increase for this period in the last ten years, and the highestsequential growth for any quarter in the last ten years. In the last month ofthe quarter we saw particularly strong growth in chipsets and Flash memory.
Total microprocessor revenue for the quarter grew at aboutthe same rate as total revenue. The total number of microprocessor units was upfrom the second quarter to a new record, and the average selling prices wereflat. Unit volumes of chipsets and Flash memory products were higher than inthe second quarter and unit volumes in motherboards were lower. 
Revenue was up approximately 20% from the second quarter forthe mobility group, and up 12% for the digital enterprise group with higherrevenue for microprocessors and chipsets in the desktop, notebook, and servercomputing segments. The Flash memory group achieved sequential growth ofapproximately 12%, primarily due to growth in revenue from higher density NANDmemory products.
Gross margin percentage of 52.4% was more than 5 pointshigher in the second quarter. The key components of the change were largely aswe anticipated in July. Higher unit volumes and lower unit costs formicroprocessors and lower startup costs for new manufacturing processorssubstantially improved the gross margin percentage. 
Offsetting this were the inventory write-offs we took as weramped a new 45 nanometer process and built products that did not qualify forsale in the third quarter and therefore could not be classified as inventory. 
We had expected overall average selling prices to be down alittle bit in a competitive environment, but these were held flat. Gross marginpercentage was about 0.5 point below the midpoint of the September update. Whileunit demand and overall pricing for microprocessors was better than anticipatedin September, demand for chipsets and Flash memory during the month, andparticularly through the end of the month, also exceeded expectations and grewat a faster rate than microprocessors. The result was a product mix with ahigher than expected proportion of products with margins lower thanmicroprocessors. 
The impact of the increase in revenue was about the same asthat in the change in mix. In addition, we sold more high end products withindesktop processors and within chipsets, resulting in a higher average cost perunit.
R&D and MG&A were approximately $2.9 billion; higherthan the second quarter and higher than our outlook. Most of the sequentialincrease came from R&D on the 32 nanometer manufacturing process, andhigher revenue in profit-dependent expenses. 
In a separate category from R&D and MG&A,restructuring and asset impairment charges were $125 million, following chargesof $82 million in the second quarter. As a percent of revenue, spending thisquarter is down 1.5 points from the previous quarter and more than 3 pointsfrom the third quarter of 2006. For the year-to-date, spending as a percent ofrevenue is down nearly 6 points from 2006.
The number of employees is down by more than 2,000 duringthe quarter to approximately 88,000. The lower headcount is a sequential decreaseof more than 2% and a year-to-year decrease of nearly 12%. Operating income forthe quarter was approximately 22% of revenue, about 7 points higher than boththe previous quarter and the quarter a year ago. Operating income was 33% ofrevenue in the mobility group and 26% of revenue in the digital enterprisegroup.
On the balance sheet, total inventories were down from thesecond quarter by approximately $600 million, or 14%. Raw materials, work inprocess, and finished goods were all down, with the biggest change in work inprocess. The level of inventories is lower than I would like given the currentoutlook for demand, capacity utilization and the ramp of the 45 nanometerprocess, my goal is a small increase in inventories in the fourth quarter.
Total cash investments comprised of cash, short terminvestments, and fixed income trading assets ended the quarter at $12.5billion, $2.3 billion higher than the second quarter. Higher net cash providedby operating activities accounted for most of the increase. The largest uses ofcash were for capital spending of $1.1 billion, dividend payments of $650 million,and stock repurchases of $750 million.
As we turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter, pleasekeep in mind that unless otherwise specified, the forecasts do not include the effectsof any acquisitions, divestitures, or similar transactions that may becompleted after October 15. I will use the midpoint of forecast ranges inmaking comparisons to specific periods. 
We are planning for revenue to be between $10.5 billion and$11.1 billion. The midpoint of this range represents year-to-year growth of11%. The growth from the third quarter of 7% would be at the low end ofhistorical patterns for this period, following an unusually strong sequentialgrowth in the third quarter. 
Our outlook for gross margin percentage in the fourthquarter is 57%, plus or minus a couple of points. Most of the increase ofnearly 5 points from the third quarter should come from two major categories. Thefirst is lower unit costs for microprocessors, chipsets, and Flash memory whichwill account for the largest portion of the improvement. The second is productqualification for the new manufacturing process where we expect a higherportion of production spending to result in parts valued as inventory. 
Spending for R&D and MG&A in the fourth quarter isforecasted to be approximately $2.8 billion to $3.0 billion, flat with thethird quarter. In addition, in the separate category for restructuring andasset impairment charges, we expect expenses of approximately $130 million. Weexpect to continue to incur charges as we restructure to improve financialperformance. These charges are likely to vary quarter to quarter and to declineover time.
For the full year, we are raising our outlook for grossmargin to 52% plus or minus 1 point. We have increased the outlook for the fullyear for spending on R&D and MG&A. R&D is now forecast to beapproximately $5.8 billion and MG&A is forecast to be approximately $5.3billion. Plans are to reduce headcount again in the fourth quarter byapproximately 2,000 employees. Total headcount by the end of the year shouldapproach 86,000 down from 94,000 at the end of 2006. 
The outlook for capital spending remains $4.9 billion, plusor minus $200 million. The outlook for depreciation is also unchanged at $4.6billion, plus or minus $100 million. Our forecast for the effective tax ratefor the fourth quarter is 29%.
The results for the year-to-date, combined with our fourthquarter outlook point to a year with revenue that is approximately 9% higherthan 2006, capital spending that is 16% lower, spending that is 5 points loweras a percent of revenue and the operating profit that is nearly 50% higher. Theresults reflect excellent progress and our determination over the lastyear-and-a-half to become more competitive and more productive. 
While proud of what employees have achieved, we are alsomindful that the business remains competitive, the economy is always uncertain,and we have more work to do in the year ahead to deliver on commitments to ourstockholders. 
It is imperative that we stay focused on our priorities. Theresults announced today do not mark the end of recovery, but are a milestone ina larger program. We are building a foundation that will enable us to continueto deliver continuing improvement with better products, more innovativetechnology, and leadership in costs. 
With that let me turn it back to Paul.
Paul Otellini
Thanks, Andy. Just one more thing I'd like to cover beforeturning it to questions. Today we are announcing that Stacy Smith is beingpromoted to Chief Financial Officer. Stacy has been our Assistant CFO and hasbeen at Intel for 19 years with a career spanning finance, sales and marketing,and information technology. At the same time, Andy Bryant is being appointedChief Administrative Officer with Stacy reporting to him. 
These moves are part of our long-term management successionplanning. Andy has been our CFO since 1994 and has been our longest-serving CFOever. We want to thank him for his outstanding results and look forward to manyfurther contributions in his new role. 
Kevin Sellers
Thanks, Paul. Operator, we'll now open up the line forquestions and answers.
Question-and-AnswerSession
Operator
Your first question comes from John Pitzer - Credit Suisse.
 John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
Paul, when you saw ASPs flat sequentially in the quarter,was that a change in the competitive environment, a change in the product mix,or a little bit of both? What is your outlook for pricing as we move into thecalendar fourth quarter?
 Paul Otellini
I thinkit's a reflection of the product portfolio more than anything else. You sawrecord numbers in servers, you saw record numbers in mobile, the two hottestparts in the marketplace; and you saw, if you derive the numbers, anincrease in average selling price in desktop, which really reflects thestrength of the core brand on the dual and quad-core processors. 
One of the things that Andy talked about in his margincomments was that our mix in desktop processors towards quad-core over thecourse of the quarter actually improved, which drove costs up a bit, but alsodrove revenue up.
 John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
If you look at the suite of products that are coming downthe pipeline, the sweet spot that you're going to hit with Penryn and Nehalem.If the pricing environment improves, oftentimes you guys have seen grossmargins well above 60%. Is that something we can look forward to as we gothrough the balance of calendar year '08?
 Paul Otellini
I don't think we're in a position to forecast '08 margins.We'll do that three months from today.
Operator
Your next question comes from Chris Danely – JP Morgan. 
 Chris Danely - JP Morgan
Congratulations on a very good quarter.  Paul, there's been a lot of talk out thereabout softening demand in Q4 out of Taiwan and double ordering and tripleordering, and who knows, maybe even quadruple ordering. Can you just give usyour sense on the overall demand environment right now and are you concernedabout any sort of component stocking out there?
 Paul Otellini
I have read those reports, but we sure haven't seen it inthe marketplace or in the requests from our customers. One of the things thatwe were particularly pleased to see was the strengthening in the chipsetbusiness over the quarter, particularly the second half of September. Chipsets,as you know, tend to lead microprocessors in terms of purchases because theyget put onto a motherboard before the processor does and the lead time tends tobe four to ten weeks, depending on the customer and the transit type that he'spicked.
So my view is that people would not have continued to buyand demand chipsets for our microprocessors at that rate if we'd seen aslowdown coming or people were trying to do panic buying. So no, we've seen nosigns of this. We saw strength in Europe. We saw recordin Asia Pacific. Good solid results in Japanand the United States;so it's pretty broad based with no sign of abatement.
 Chris Danely - JP Morgan
Now that the cash position is rebuilding, can you talk aboutuses of cash and can we expect to see a little bit more aggressive buybackhere?
 Andy Bryant
As a matter of policy we don't comment on the future levelof buybacks. We do have a $16 billion program that's been authorized that we'reoperating under. If you look at the third quarter, what you saw is that we didincrease the buyback to $750 million. In addition, we paid a dividend of about $650million, and on top of that we grew the cash level by $2.3 billion. I won'tcomment specifically on Q4, but our strategy is unchanged of distributing cashto the shareholders via a combination of both buybacks and dividends and that'swhat you saw us do in Q3.
Operator
Your next question comes from Sumit Dhanda - Banc of AmericaSecurities. 
 Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Securities
The first question I had was back to Q3 gross margins. Iunderstand your point about a big jump in growth in chipsets and Flash whichare lower margin products. I am still trying to reconcile a little bit versusthe original guidance, your revenues actually came in $700 million higherversus the midpoint of the original guidance. Is all of that upside in revenuesoffset by a more diluted mix or is there more of an explanation to this thanyou offered up earlier?
 Andy Bryant
It will be a pretty simple explanation. If you look at therevenue growth from Q2 to Q3, it came almost in normal mix, the same mix as wehad in Q2. But as a result, even though I have shipped 500 million moremicroprocessors and I got higher revenue for those, I also shipped 300 millionmore of the lower margin products and the margin percentage hasn't changed; absolutemargins does. On $1.4 billion of revenue increase, you pick up $1.2 billion ingross margin improvement. 
As you've seen in the past in these periods, when revenuespikes it only spikes in processors which tends to give you a mix benefit. Soall we saw this quarter was basically an even distribution of growth in all thepipelines. We saw the good news we expected in lower startup costs and we saw alittle bit of bad news offsetting that with the write-offs on the 45-nanometerproducts that aren't yet qualified for shipment.
 Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Securities
On that last point, was that drag as anticipated? I thinkyou had said it was 1 to 2 points of a drag.
 Andy Bryant
 At the end of thequarter we said 1 to 2 points there. It was almost in the very middle of the 1 to2 point range so no change at all. In fact, if we look at our midpoint of 57%in the fourth quarter, that's 3 to 4 points of lower unit costs and 1 to 2points of improvement for the evaluation on the 45-nanometer products. 
We are seeing the full factories, but the full factoriescosts are coming down much better than I anticipated even three or four monthsago, and that is driving 3 to 4 points of margin improvement in the fourthquarter.
 Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Securities
The improvement that you talk about on gross margins, thebulk of it you attributed to lower unit costs, is that also being aided bybetter fab loading? Is that engrained in that reduction in unit costs?
 Andy Bryant
 In the fourth quarterthat's a big part of it, because we typically carry around 90 days ofinventory. You can almost say what you build in Q3 is what you're going to shipin Q4. We know what we're building now is full factories; full factories aredriving costs lower. We are also getting some efficiency out of the program welaunched, so the manufacturing folks are doing a wonderful job of getting moreoutput per person, more output per machine. The combination of those thingsabsolutely is giving us a wonderful cost per unit surprise in the fourthquarter.
 Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Securities
 A question on ASPs.You talked about the strength in mobile servers, higher ASP products, and thenhigh-end desktops. Why was there not an actual sequential improvement in ASPs?Is the strategy here to try to get as much volume while keeping the ASPs flat?
 Paul Otellini
As I talked about last time, we're trying to be smart andselective about the business we take and we executed that, I think, very wellover the course of this quarter. If you do the math, desktop ASPs are up anddesktop is where much of the ASP erosion in the last year, year-and-a-half hadoccurred. So the fact that our mix there was generating better pricing I thinkwas really something we liked. 
At the same time that happened, we walked from a lot of lowend business on the desktop and the notebook at prices that we just didn'tthink made sense to us. So you'll see us continue to take, I think, a veryselective approach to this.
 Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Securities
I understand the comment that you repurchased $750 millionworth of stock, but it didn't seem to offset the dilution in the quarter. Isthe plan to be perhaps a little more aggressive going forward given thebuilding cash balance?
 Paul Otellini
Again, I'm not going to give you a forecast for Q4. We didbring up the buyback in Q3 and our strategy is to return cash to shareholdersvia both buybacks and dividends. You're going to see us continue to do that.
Operator
Your next question comes from Uche Orji - UBS. 
Uche Orji  - UBS
You mentioned inventory being at a level below where you arecomfortable with now. What is a normal level of inventory you want to get to? Thereason I ask this question is if I look back at 2005 when you said to rebuildinventory, so this time around the first question is, what is a normal levelfor you and how do you prevent overshooting on the upside?
 Andy Bryant
I wish there were a simple answer to normal. What inventoryneeds to be varies depending on prior transitions and varies depending on thequarters you are coming into. Right now we have a product transition. We told youat the analyst meeting earlier this year we hoped to build a little extrainventory which you always do in case your products don't qualify. So I wouldliked to have had a little cushion for that. At the same time, we know that thefourth quarter is typically our high revenue quarter. I would have liked tohave had extra inventory for that. 
The simple answer is I'd like more in the back half of theyear, a little less during the first half of the year and I'd like to get throughmy product transition comfortably from one generation to the next with a littlebit of cushion.
In terms of how do we ensure we don't overshoot, I can'tguarantee you that. I said a few minutes ago our blueprint time in ourfactories, it's not 90 days. We reduced it a fair amount, but it's still afairly lengthy process. Given you're making revenue forecast for six months out,particularly in the strong demand environment you have to err a little bit onthe upside. 
So I can almost assure you that if the market softens, wewill end up with extra inventory and then we will patiently and systematicallywork it down to a level we're comfortable with. It's better in this business touse your fixed assets and have a little extra inventory than to go short toyour customers.
Uche Orji  - UBS
Just on a different topic, if I look at digital enterprise,the operating margins in digital enterprise were very strong this quarter and Iknow you've talked about quad-core and many other factors driving that. If youhad to break it down between units, mix, and maybe market share gain, where doyou think the biggest upside to operating margins in digital enterprise camefrom?
 Stacy Smith
 This is Stacy. Thetop line for the digital enterprise group it was very strong. We saw unitsstrong, as Paul mentioned; we saw ASP up a bit. We saw costs come down a bit inthe third quarter so that all added to the operating margin improvement. 
In addition, we saw their spending drop a bit. Some of thestartup costs associated with 45 nanometer dropped and some of their portion ofthe spending on next generation process technology came down. So you really sawimprovement across the board. 
Uche Orji  - UBS
Are these levels which you think will be sustainable over thenext 12 months? I know it's difficult to say with any amount of exact figuresas to what things will be like, but should we expect this operating marginslevel for digital enterprise to be at least sustainable, all things being equal,for the next 12 months?
 Andy Bryant
We don't typically forecast operating margin going forward.You can look at the overall improvement in gross margin from Q3 to Q4 where weadd another 5 points of gross margin improvement. I think you can take fromthat that we're expecting pretty broad based general business improvement, butI'm not going to break it out between digital enterprise group and the othersegments.
Operator
Your next question comes from Srini Pajjuri - Merrill Lynch.
 Srini Pajjuri - Merrill Lynch
Andy, just a clarification. On the mobility group, revenueswent up quite a bit yet the operating margin declined. I'm just wondering ifthis is all pricing or if there is something else there?
 Andy Bryant
 Why don't we letStacy take that one? He's in the digital enterprise and knew this one wascoming.
 Stacy Smith
 Two sides of the samecoin. Let me explain the other side of what's happening in the segments. Andy,you will have to bear with me. The mobility group story is a little bit morecomplicated than the digital enterprise story. 
The first effect that you see is that we've shifted ouradvertising from core 2 based advertising to Centrino advertising, so they'renow picking up a fairly large bill associated with the advertising costs. 
You can see in our results that the chipset volume wasexceptionally strong in the mobility segment, so you see a little bit of a mixeffect because those chipsets carry an overall gross margin percent. 
The third thing that's happening in the mobility group isthe offset to what's happening in the digital enterprise group. As mobilitygrows as a larger percent of our total business, they now are attracting alarger amount of spending for next generation process technology, for example,and those kinds of things.
The fourth effect, and the least effect frankly in thatgroup, is that the ASPs were down a little bit quarter on quarter. So you havethose four things that all hit the mobility group in the third quarter.
 Srini Pajjuri - Merrill Lynch
 Just a follow-up tothat, given the ramps at Santa Rosaand the strong demand, I would have expected ASPs in the mobility to be morestable than down. I'm just curious as to what's going on there?
 Andy Bryant
I think this is coming back to the point that Paul made.While our product strength is leading to a very good overall result of flatASPs, there are still segments of the market that are very, very competitiveand I would say the low end segment of the notebook market is one of those.
 Srini Pajjuri - Merrill Lynch
Paul, clearly this year is unusual compared to your historicseasonal trends and my question is, is there something structurally changingabout the business that we are going to see this pull in from Q4 into Q3 goingforward? Or any insight that you can call out as to why we are seeing such astrong Q3 this year versus previous years?
 Paul Otellini
 No. We don't see thatat all and I don't think there's a pull-in. I would not at all categorize it asthat. We saw demand building over the course of the quarter, that's theopposite of a pull-in. I think the overarching thing we're seeing is thatnotebooks as a generic product type have really ignited in markets around theworld. That was the principal reason we think we saw such strength in Europe.
One of the things you're going to see that is inevitable isthat as notebook volumes grow, notebook prices will come down, particularly inthe consumer segments. In the grand scheme of things that's good for us,because while they're still coming down from where they were, they're a heck ofa lot better than where the desktop is. Having a secular long-term growth innotebooks I think is the best thing for our industry right now.
 Srini Pajjuri - Merrill Lynch
 Well, if that trendis going to continue then why wouldn't you see a normal Q4, is my question?
 Paul Otellini
 Well, we're forecastinga Q4 which is at the low end of seasonal norms and it's inside the normal rangeby definition. The low end tends to happen in those years when we see a betterthan average Q3. So it's very identical to prior patterns.
 Srini Pajjuri - Merrill Lynch
 Andy, you said yourheadcount is going to come down again in Q4. Does that mean your OpEx will comedown as well beyond Q4? I'm just looking for modeling purposes.
 Andy Bryant
 What we said for thefourth quarter was OpEx was flat as we saved some money through the efficiencyprogram, through resources, at the same time we expect higher revenue andhigher profit-dependent expenses. The real answer is what we've said is wewould like to see spending probably trail revenue, trend towards flat to up alittle bit next year. That's what we would look at right now. 
Our plan is not done yet. We need to get that done. That'sour bias going in. We'll see what projects come forward and if we want tochange that, we'll let you know.
Operator
Your next question comes from Glen Yeung - Citigroup. 
 Glen Yeung - Citigroup
It looks like you've got headcount down to 88,000 going to86,000 employees. When you originally announced the headcount, I think thetarget was closer to the low 90s. Are you actually expecting more headcountreduction than you originally had planned? 
The follow-on to that is you talked about $1 billion insavings for '08. Is that number going to be a higher number as a result?
Andy Bryant
We would expect headcount to be a little bit lower than we originallyplanned. Note when we began this program -- actually, I probably should letStacy take this -- when we began this program we were on a two to three-year program.We only gave you a headcount number for about halfway through. So we did expectto continue to drive it lower. It was included in this expected $1 billionsavings for '08. We think we're essentially on -- maybe a little ahead -- interms of headcount reduction.
 Stacy Smith
I would just add overall in terms of the restructuringnumbers we gave you at the beginning, we had said $2 billion of savings andefficiencies for 2007 and another $1 billion for 2008. The headcount trend ispretty much right on, maybe a little bit ahead, and in general we're on trackfor that level of savings by the end of next year.
 Glen Yeung - Citigroup
One other statement that you made, I think at the springanalyst day, was talking about unit costs for 2008 looking flattish. I thinkyou gave us a chart, not numbers, so it was kind of hard to tell; buteyeballing it, it looked flat to slightly up in 2008 versus 2007. Now thatyou've seen the '07 back half of your unit costs look a little bit better, isthere any change to that unit cost outlook for '08?
 Andy Bryant
 There may be butthat's a tough one to get to right now. What I would tell you is in Q4, becauseof the loadings in the factories, I think it's a little lower than what we hadsaid. What we had said in the analyst meetings in the first quarter it wouldspike up a little bit because the cost of 45 nanometer wafers in the beginningof the ramp would be higher and then they would go back down in the back halfof next year. 
I think we'll see the same pattern. If the factories stayfull, we'll just see it off of a lower starting point. So Q4 would be a littlelower than we expected. You'd still see a little bit of round up in the firsthalf and right back down in the second half.
 Glen Yeung - Citigroup
No change in the relative magnitude, in other words, right? Lowerstarting point but the magnitude of increase in the first quarter is largelythe same?
 Andy Bryant
Well, really I haven't modeled those, so I don't want tostart making up numbers here on the call. I will say the same direction. Idon't want to speak to magnitude.
 Glen Yeung - Citigroup
When you look in your fourth quarter, Andy, you suggestedthat inventories would be slightly up. Do you think you will be back at levelsat which you're comfortable at that point, or do you think they actually needto move higher still?
 Andy Bryant
 Assuming we meet themidpoint of our revenue range we will be below our comfort level.
 Glen Yeung - Citigroup
After Q4, below the comfort level of inventories?
 Andy Bryant
 Yes.
 Glen Yeung - Citigroup
Thanks. Congratulations, by the way, on all the promotions.

Your next question comes from Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers. 
Tim Luke  - Lehman Brothers
Nice job on the quarter and congratulations to Stacy andAndy. Just to follow-on with respect to elements that may influence the shapeof the margin expectation in the beginning of the first half of '08, could youjust remind us, Andy, of some of the elements there? Obviously you seem to besuggesting that the cost per unit may be up a bit in the beginning of '08, butcould you just give us a reminder of some of the gross margin framework thatyou'd outlined?
 Andy Bryant
Let's begin by saying I'm not giving a gross margin forecastfor the first quarter yet, but the thing I want you to be careful about in theassumption you just made, when I showed that cost curve, it says costs per unitproduced will go up in the first quarter. It doesn't mean cost per unit soldwill. We have this 90-day inventory funnel so what you build in one quartergets sold in the next, and I expect Q4 to be a very good cost-producing quarter.It means in the costs of sale line you'll see it rising up more towards thesecond quarter as opposed to the first quarter.
The second most important thing for our costs would be whathappens with demand? If our factories stay full it will be a good cost year. Ifit is overheated and  if it slows downsome, then it changes. I can actually build a case it can go lots of differentways. We are looking at the sale of our NOR Flash business. If that happens, itwould help margin percentages. 
We're going to continue to drive product technology,continue to improve our road map. Those things all tend to help. The mostimportant variable though, to keep watching is the worldwide economy. I reallywant to emphasize worldwide. We tend to get focused on the U.S.retail and how did the Christmas season do? In our business now, that's muchless important than how the worldwide economies are performing.
Tim Luke  - Lehman Brothers
With respect to that, Paul, you talked about the U.S.Do you see any difference between U.S.consumer, U.S.enterprise in terms of the way you've seen demand?
 Paul Otellini
No, we haven't. In fact, I think there was a lot ofnervousness associated with the credit market crunch and would that impactconsumer spending? We really haven't seen that at all. I don't know if you guyshave seen the San Jose Mercury but there's a wonderful survey they did todaythat people rate for Christmas. They ask for Christmas, what is the number onething you want? PCs trumped happiness and peace.
Tim Luke  - Lehman Brothers
 With respect to theNOR disposal, could you just remind us what the date is for that and how weshould model that in terms of inclusion and exclusion?
 Stacy Smith
The expectation is that we close it in Q4. In terms of howto model it, again the elements that will change is you'll see the NOR revenuecoming out, the associated cost of sales coming out, spending will get a littlebit better and then we pick up our piece of the gain or loss from the companyas an interest and other charge. 
The expectation that you should model is once this closesit's 1 to 2 points of gross margin. Right now, the thing we're waiting on isafter we see it, we have to file our response and then we hope to get good newsback.
Tim Luke  - Lehman Brothers
 But the revenue guideincludes a full quarter of NOR?
 Paul Otellini
 Yes.
 Stacy Smith
 What you see in Q4 ismodeling that it's here for the full quarter and we're working like heck to getthe deal done.
Tim Luke  - Lehman Brothers
 Lastly, just on thisgross margin, it is a significant uptick, but does that assume that pricingcontinues to stabilize or are there different elements of the assumption forASPs there?
 Andy Bryant
 As always, we assumea relatively competitive environment out there. We plan to sell our product andcompete in the marketplace.

Operator
Your next question comes from Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank. 
 Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
The strength that you're seeing recently Paul, without Andyhaving reported yet, of course, how would you constitute it? A strong generalmarket for PCs versus market share gains, even if it's only in the markets youreally choose to participate in?
 Paul Otellini
 Well, given ourrelative position I have to conclude it's a strong general market.
 Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Have you seen any change in the competitive dynamic outthere, whether it be in your ability to cherry pick the markets because of yoursuperior products or any strategic shifts out there that you're seeing?
 Paul Otellini
Well, the biggest shift in the last six months certainly isour ability to participate very aggressively in servers. I mean, the fact thatwe have record server unit numbers is a very good leading indicator of Intelback in its game across the board. Servers have always been a very goodbusiness for us and I think we're outgrowing the industry right now, so this isgood. 
As we look forward, one of the reasons we are developingfamilies of products like the ones I showed you at the analyst meeting calledSilverthorn and the follow-on products is so that we can address these ultralow price points with very good margin products.
 Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
A slightly related question; there are a lot of worries outin the market similar to some of the other questions that you've alreadyanswered about excess MPU processors being shipped into the market versusoverall PC demand. Clearly, the strength that you've seen now addresses some ofthose, but channel inventory as a whole, have you seen that coming down inaggregate? It appears there wouldn't be a ton of Intel inventory, but ingeneral, what comments do you have on channel inventory?
 Paul Otellini
 You mean finishedunits? Finished systems?
 Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
 Correct. Microprocessors,motherboards, whatever stage of the completion you want to talk about.
 Paul Otellini
All we can look at is our inventory, particularly ourdistributor inventories and they're in very good shape. In fact, I'd like tohave a little bit more inside than outside if we had them. In terms of theinventory at our customers, I think you have to ask them what their positionis. We don't see any backup at all.
Operator
Your next question comes from Hans Mosesmann - RaymondJames. 
 Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James
At this pace, quad-core is in a mix of desktops. What do youexpect the mix to be a year from now? Right now it's probably in the lowsingle-digits, low double-digits, as a percent of your desktop shipments?
 Paul Otellini
 Well, that's a demandquestion. The supply can be almost anything we want it to be. So it really is afunction of how the demand grows at certain price points and what thecompetitive environment for quad or for things greater than 2 core are. Rightnow we see quad tending to populate the price points for microprocessors thatare sort of 150 and above, and that tends to be a double-digit percent of themarket but not 50% of the market.
 Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James
 So, like a quarter ofyour business or less?
 Paul Otellini
 I'm not going to letyou tie me down that closely; I can't. Because part of this thing iscompetitive modeling, part of it is how the demand shifts over the year.
 Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James
The timing of chipset sales, strong sales in September, doesthat give us a sense that Q1 visibility is improving in an unusual fashion atthis time of the year?
 Andy Bryant
 I wouldn't go thatfar. The same thing Paul said earlier. When you see strong chipset sales forthe last two weeks of the quarter, it means the motherboard manufacturers arepreparing to meet demand in the fourth quarter. It's certainly a better signthan if they were sitting on the sideline.
 Paul Otellini
Our chipset attach rate, the percent of our processors thatend up getting an Intel chipset has been going up over the second half of thisyear, driven by the shift in mobility and the success of vPro. That dynamic isinside this as well.
Operator
Your next question comes from Gurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns.
 Gurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns
Do you think mobility is describing a step function increasein PC unit growth, given the strength you have seen in Q3 and Q4? How long isthis going to last, or does the strength in Q3 and Q4 just make you a lot moreapprehensive about Q1?
 Paul Otellini
 Well, I'm notnecessarily apprehensive about Q1. At this point it's too soon to call it, butI would be surprised if it's other than seasonal. I'll give you two datapoints. The first is that most of the third-party analysts are stillforecasting a growth next year, 2008, in the sort of 12% to 14% range. Second of all, wecontinue to track onto a projection that we gave you at the analyst meeting ofIntel mobile unit shipments crossing over desktop unit shipments in 2009.  I think that both of those dynamics areworking to our advantage still.
Operator
Your final question comes from Joanne Feeney – FTN Midwest. 
 Joanne Feeney - FTN Midwest
Just a question to finalize the discussion of ASPs, and thena quick follow-up. You remarked that ASPs in desktops were up; notebooksslightly down. Can you tell us about the server ASPs?
 Andy Bryant
 We're not going to gothrough all the detail on ASPs.
 Joanne Feeney - FTN Midwest
Just on capacity and your ability to further ramp production,I'm wondering if the forecast for next quarter of about 7% revenue growth mightreflect some capacity utilization topping out you have right now and yourconcerns about raising inventory back to comfortable levels. Is it just toocostly at this point to try to push capacity a bit further to do better than 7%and raise your inventory back up to comfortable levels?
 Andy Bryant
 No, it's not a costissue at all. The strength of the third quarter was above what we expected. Aswe said we were lower on inventory levels than we would like. We're currentlymeeting our customer commitments for Q4, but if demand is significantly abovethe range that we're expecting we'll be hard pressed to go above it from thestandpoint of exceeding the revenue range. 
So not a cost issue. We're just moving as fast as we can tokeep up with the market.
Kevin Sellers
 As we wrap up thecall, I want to turn the time over to Paul briefly for some closing comments. 
 Paul Otellini
 Thanks, Kevin. Inclosing, I want to say that while we've made great progress on our strategy todeliver new and exciting leadership products, to leverage our manufacturing andsilicon processing leadership and to restructure the company, we're notstanding still. We're well along in our development of a robust 32-nanometertechnology and have demonstrated our next generation, Nehalem microarchitecturejust a couple of weeks after we saw First Silicon. 
These demonstrations are proof that our tick-tock strategycontinues its relentless march, allowing us to push innovation forward in newand exciting ways.

Paul Otellini 
Thanks, Kevin and thank you all for joining us today. In Q2, Intel delivered another quarter of solid financial results, reflecting both our product and technology leadership and continued gains in our operational performance. Orders strengthened and revenue came in above the midpoint of our expectation. 
In addition, our restructuring efforts led to strong growth and operating profits which were up 26% from a year ago. We are particularly pleased with the execution of our factory network, which continues to deliver world class yields, lower unit costs and faster throughput times. 
While demand for computers was strong, pricing remained competitive, notably in the low end of the PC marketplace. Our technology leadership did give us relative stability in the server and performance notebook categories, however. Let's take a minute to review the business in our major product areas. 
In servers, we continued to see strong acceptance of our Xeon Quad Core processors as unit shipments doubled in the second quarter. We have now shipped over a million Quad Core server processors since our November launch. In total, our server units and revenue were up by double-digit percentages both sequentially and year over year. Later in the third quarter we will bring the benefits of our core micro architecture to the MP segment for the first time with the launch of our Caneland platform. 
In mobile, revenues were up by more than 20% year over year. We launched our Santa Rosa platform, which has more than 230 design wins around the world and continues to ramp quickly. Mobile represented 40% of our client shipments in Q2 and we will continue to benefit from the market shift to mobile in the second half. 
Desktop unit demand came in higher than seasonal with strength across the board while revenue was lower on a year-over-year basis. Intel's channel business remained strong and grew in a seasonally down quarter, ending the quarter with inventories that were lower and well within our goals. We also launched a new desktop version of the Core 2 Extreme yesterday, marking the introduction of Intel's 14th Quad Core microprocessor SKU. 
In chipsets, we had an all-time unit record with sequential growth across desktop, mobile, and server. This reflects the competitiveness of our road map and generated strong bookings for Q3, giving us further confidence in a solid second half demand environment. 
We also launched our 3 series chipset family which supports today's Core 2 Duo and Quad processors, but also provides socket compatibility for Penryn, giving the industry a fast migration path to our 45 nanometer microprocessor family. 
Our flash results were mixed. The NAND business saw a nice jump in units, densities, and ASPs, but NOR demand was weaker than we expected, resulting in some margin pressure that Andy will describe shortly. 
Turning to technology, I am very pleased with the results we are seeing in our development and manufacturing teams. We remain firmly on track to ramp the world's first 45 nanometer logic process in the second half of this year and ship a broad family of 45 nanometer processors by the end of the year. 
Our manufacturing organization is delivering faster factory throughput times, higher yields, and improved equipment utilization. As a result of their efficiencies, we are now able to lower Intel's 2007 capital spending forecast by about $600 million without compromising our ability to service a growing computing industry. 
There are a number of benefits that we derive from our throughput time reductions. We have reduced Intel's pipeline inventory by several weeks, enabling us to meet customer demand with lower inventory on hand. We are able to iterate new products more quickly, decreasing the time to healthy silicon. Lastly, shorter throughput times allow us to start new wafers closer to the time our customers need the output, giving us truer demand signals and a better ability to respond to a changing mix. 
This is just one good example of the results we were looking for when we launched our structure and efficiency review last year. As these projects are combined with our technology and product leadership, we've become a leaner, more competitive and more agile company. 
In summary, Intel delivered solid financial results in a competitive environment. We grew revenues above our expectations and we grew profits at a healthy pace compared to the same period last year. As we look out to the remainder of this year and into the next, we see our product and technology advantages continuing to provide differentiation and meaningful opportunities for growth. 
Let me now turn the call over to Andy for a detailed look at our financial performance as well as our business outlook for the second half. 
Andy Bryant 
 Thanks, Paul. Despite the competitive environment in a season when results are typically subdued, Intel returned to year-to-year growth during the quarter with higher revenue and higher operating profit. Revenue was up 8% for the second quarter of 2006. The microprocessor business delivered double-digit revenue growth, led by notebooks and servers. 
Microprocessor and chipset revenue for notebook computers were each up over 22%. While pricing trends and manufacturing start-up costs weighed on gross margin, operating income grew by 26%. Inventories were lower than at the end of the second quarter of 2006 and the first quarter of this year. 
Tax items during the quarter added $0.03 to earnings per share. We are forecasting sequential and year-to-year growth in the third quarter and foresee an improving second half with strong product and the launch of the 45 nanometer process. We expect margin improvement through the end of the year. 
Revenue for the second quarter was $8.7 billion, down 2% from the first quarter and consistent with seasonal patterns. The total number of microprocessor units was up slightly, and the average selling prices were lower. 
Unit volumes of chipsets and flash memory products were higher than in the first quarter and unit volumes in motherboards were lower. 
Revenue for the digital enterprise group was down 2% from the first quarter, primarily due to lower revenue from desktop microprocessors and the divestures of some communications businesses, partially offset by higher unit volumes at servers and chipsets. 
In the mobility group, slightly lower revenue from microprocessors was offset by higher revenue from chipsets, and total revenue was approximately flat for the first quarter. Gross margin percentage of 47% was approximately 3 points lower than the first quarter. Lower average selling prices of microprocessors, chipsets and flash memory and lower sales of previously written-off microprocessor inventory lowered the percentage, net of the incremental contributions from higher unit volumes and lower unit costs for microprocessors. 
Although revenue was higher than the midpoint of the range we forecasted in April, gross margin percentage was below the midpoint. While unit demand for microprocessors exceeded our expectations in April, average selling prices for microprocessors, chipsets and flash were below our forecast and the market for NOR flash memory was weaker than anticipated. 
R&D and MG&A were approximately $2.6 billion, in line with the forecast and approximately flat with the first quarter. In addition, we had restructuring and asset impairment charges of $82 million, following charges of $75 million in the first quarter. 
Again, this quarter the progress we have made in cutting expenses is most apparent in the year-to-year comparison. Spending for R&D and MG&A is down approximately 15% from the second quarter of 2006. As a percent of revenue, spending during this period has declined by 8 percentage points. The number of employees is down by more than 12,000 or 12%, to 90,300. 
The provision for taxes in the second quarter was unusually low due to a number of items primarily related to the reversal of previously accrued taxes for transfer pricing and R&D tax credit. The provision in the first quarter was also unusually low as it includes a reversal of previously accrued taxes of approximately $330 million related to a tax settlement. 
Fully diluted earnings per share were $0.22. The tax items added $0.03 to earnings per share. 
On the balance sheet, total inventories were down more than 5% from the first quarter. Raw materials, work in process and finished goods were all down. Total cash investments comprised of cash, short-term investments and fixed income trading assets ended the quarter at $10.2 billion, $1.6 billion higher than the first quarter. Net cash provided by operating activities was higher during the quarter and net cash provided by investing activities was lower. 
Capital spending was $1.3 billion, dividend payments were $650 million, and stock repurchases were $100 million. 
As we now turn to the outlook for the third quarter, please keep in mind that unless otherwise specified, the forecasts do not include the effect of any acquisitions, divestures, or similar transactions that may be completed after July 16. I will use the midpoint of forecast ranges when making comparisons to specific periods. 
We are planning for revenue to be between $9 billion and $9.6 billion. The midpoint of this range would be an increase from the second quarter of 7% and growth year to year of 6%. 
Our outlook for gross margin percentage in the third quarter is 52% plus or minus a couple of points. While lower average selling prices in a competitive environment and higher write-offs in advance of the 45 nanometer process will reduce profits from the second quarter, we expect the impact of lower start-up costs for new manufacturing processes, lower unit costs for microprocessors, and higher unit volumes for microprocessors and chipsets to result in a net gain of 5 points. 
Spending for R&D and MG&A in the third quarter is forecasted to be approximately $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion, slightly higher than the second quarter. In addition, in the separate category for restructuring and asset impairment charges, we expect expenses of approximately $150 million. We expect to continue to incur charges as we restructure the company to improve financial performance, but we do not have a full-year forecast for this category. 
For the year, we are maintaining our outlook for gross margin of 51% plus or minus a few points. As we have discussed before, manufacturing start-up costs for the year were concentrated in the first half and will decline substantially as we approach the launch of 45 nanometer. The results for the first half when gross margin was 48.5%, combined with the outlook for the third quarter and the year, point to a gross margin for the second half between 52% and 54%. 
We have increased the outlook for spending on R&D by $100 million and now forecast $5.7 billion for the full year. The forecast for spending for MG&A remains $5.1 billion. We have cut capital spending target for the year by $600 million and now forecast $4.9 billion plus or minus $200 million. The largest portion of this reduction comes from capital efficiencies from a range of projects, including more efficient use of tools and a better yield. Our forecast for the effective tax rate in each of the remaining quarters of the year is 29%. 
Our first half results have set a firm foundation for the year and Intel appears to be on track to deliver increasing returns. Our business remains competitive, but it is essential that we focus on the right priorities. Those priorities, which remained unchanged, are deliver products that customers find compelling; to execute superbly with the ramp of 45 nanometer technology; and to attack costs on all fronts from the factories, in R&D and MG&A. 
With that let me turn it over to Kevin for Q&A. 
Kevin Sellers 
Thanks, Andy. We'd now like to open the line for questions and answers. We'll take as many as time will permit. Go ahead. 
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from the line of Glen Yeung - Citigroup. 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
When I look at the guidance that you've got for the third quarter revenues, yes, it is in line with normal seasonal, but it only reflects 6% year-over-year growth. I wonder if you could explain why you think the year-over-year growth rate is decelerating from what it was in the second quarter? 
 Andy Bryant
 Well, it is easier to explain how the third quarter relates to the second quarter, relates to the first quarter. If you look at the second quarter actual results, it is at a little bit of the better end of the high end of seasonality, but within what I would call historical ranges. That's where we have pegged Q3 again and probably right in the middle of a seasonal third quarter. 
We do believe that the worldwide economy is relatively strong. We didn't see anything unusual by geography. The product families all look relatively healthy. I think we're just positioning ourselves for a seasonally stronger second half. 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
 Let me move on to the way you look at gross margins. I know you made the point that it is going to be helped out by lower start-up unit costs, higher volumes. What are your thoughts with respect to pricing in the third quarter? and I wonder if you could be specific on both microprocessor, but also what you're seeing on flash given that it seemed to hurt you in the second quarter? 
 Andy Bryant
Well, I will do the best I can. Why don't I start with a high level explanation of gross margin Q2 to Q3, and then we can talk a little bit about the pricing environment. 
If you look at the improvement of 5 points, it comes from a variety of places. We do expect unit volumes to be up. We also expect average selling prices to be down a little bit, and we expect unit costs to be down. If you take all three of those categories and say those are kind of microprocessor operating items, you get almost 3 points of good news of gross margin quarter to quarter. 
The fact that you don't have the start-up costs, obviously you don't have as much in start-up costs in the third quarter versus second quarter, there is almost 2 points of good news in margin. 
You also have an extra point of what I will call miscellaneous items. For example, because we're selling the NOR flash business depreciation got suspended, so there is no depreciation in the third quarter. It makes margins a little better. An extra point of a lot of little things like that. The negative offset is as you begin to build the 45-nanometer product that's not yet qualified for sale, you can't put those costs in inventory, so we will have a bit of a drag on the build of product that isn't qualified for revenue until the fourth quarter. That's 1 to 2 points negative. 
Now, as far as the pricing environment. It was a more competitive pricing environment than we thought in Q2, and we expect it to continue to be somewhat competitive which is what you're seeing in our margin outlook for the year. We believe the best defense against the competitive price environment is better product. 
If you look at what's happening with us the last year, you've seen better products quarter by quarter by quarter. You've seen improved product differentiation, 45 nanometer coming out; the Penryn product family, as Paul talked about. So what you're seeing is Intel's commitment and focus to making our products better and better and better which is the best defense we have in a competitive pricing situation. 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
Andy, is the pricing pressure the same now as it has been all year? Is it getting worse or getting better? 
 Paul Otellini
 I would say it is different, Glen. It is much more targeted now at the low end of the desktop and even a little bit of the notebook marketplace, and a year ago it was higher in the stacks in many areas. 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
 That's helpful. Thanks, Paul. 
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of John Lau - Jefferies. 
John Lau - Jefferies
Paul, I was wondering if you can give us your comments with regards to your outlook on demand? Where do you see the growth opportunities going forward that would surprise you? Are you anticipating an even stronger launch for Santa Rosa in Q3? Where can we see this upside and strength? Is it in the emerging markets? Just a little bit of color on that. Thank you. 
 Paul Otellini
 Sure. When you say growth opportunities, I am assuming you mean the second half of this year, not long term. 
John Lau - Jefferies
 That's correct. 
 Paul Otellini
You're right. As Andy said, we saw strength in the second quarter across the board. It was essentially in all geographies, in all segments of the market in computing space. As we talked about in NOR flash there was some softness from a demand standpoint and pricing pressure. 
But if I stick to computing, I think what we're likely to see in the second half of this year is an expansion of that. I see particular interest in notebooks. You're right about Santa Rosa. It is off to a great start, and I would expect the volume to continue the transition very rapidly from Napa to Santa Rosa. 
We're seeing very good progress on our Quad-Core Xeon DP server products that I talked about. We're now sampling Caneland which is our first core-based micro architecture platform for MP, for multi-processing servers, and that goes into full production later this quarter. We would expect to see expansion from both mobile, globally, and servers globally and inside the segments, MP presence in servers. 
John Lau - Jefferies
Now with regards to the pricing pressure that you mentioned, I assume that most of that was in the desktop area. Do you see as you continue to emphasize more of that mobility and the Quad-Core version of the server market you will be able to mitigate some of that downside? 
 Paul Otellini
One would hope so, although the low end of the consumer notebook market is very competitive as you've seen, obviously, if you walk through the retail shelves nowadays. 
Operator
 Our next question comes from Michael Masdea - Credit Suisse. 
Michael Masdea - Credit Suisse
First question is high level. If you look at where you were at the beginning of the year and you look at where you are now, it seems like you've increased your lead both on the manufacturing side and product side, yet pricing still seems fairly aggressive, even to the point where it seems to have surprised you a little bit. Help us reconcile as to any guess as to why that is? 
 Andy Bryant
 We expected a competitive pricing environment most of the year. I agree it was a little more aggressive than we thought in the second quarter, but not much compared to our expectations. We know that AMD will continue to sell parts, we know they'll continue to sell aggressively. Our intent is to continue to protect and build share if we can. Our intent is to bring better products to the marketplace and as Paul said, focus on the high end where we think we'll have less competitive pressure. 
Michael Masdea - Credit Suisse
On another area, the stock buyback, your peak was over 3 billion, and we've been pretty steadily trending down now to about 100 million. Is there any point in which you start to step that up? Is it just a function of the stock price or is there something else going on there? 
 Andy Bryant
 We do stock buyback probably a little different than most. We do meet on with our board quarterly, we talk about strategic projects, we talk about cash reserves. We set a cash target, we protect the dividend, we pay the dividend and then buy backs are almost a drop off from that equation; not exactly, but close. 
If our business continues to generate cash either we have to come up with some really good ideas fast or you would see us start to buy back some more. 
Operator
 Our next question comes from the line of Chris Delaney - JP Morgan. 
Chris Delaney - JP Morgan
Can you just talk about the inventory trends? Your inventory came down by about eight days. Did that have anything to do with the lower margin? How should we be looking at utilization rates in the second half of the year? 
 Andy Bryant
No, I don't think it had anything to do with margin. I understand your point. Clearly a little bit, but in reality let's think about inventory. Inventory down over $200 million, part of that was we shipped more product. We said unit demand was higher; but part of that was the improved throughput. So if you can think back to the analyst meeting when Bob showed that we were getting throughput improvements, that allows us to stage less inventory and raw material in the factories, so I can save inventory there, and we aggressively focused on that in the second quarter. 
The second thing is the capital came down because of improved efficiency. Improved efficiency means either higher yield or higher time on equipment. If you can have more good product come out of what you put into that factory again, you don't have to have as much inventory in WIP to satisfy the same demand. 
All of those things were in play to try to make sure we saved inventory if we could. No question, if I were to start more wafers I would have absorbed more spending, I would have made my Q2 number look better but at the same time then I would have had a higher cost one day when I had to get rid of the excess inventory. So we think we're doing the right thing, and yes you're right; there is some small connection between the two. 
As far as the trends, I would expect inventory in the third quarter, I think flat is a good target in a quarter with increasing revenue. I would like to see that. Another piece I would point out to you is if you look at all of our inventory, our inventory in the channel came down which is unusual in a second quarter. So again, a lot of good things happened to keep inventory down in the second quarter. 
The next question was under-utilization charges. We did have some in the second quarter. When we started the quarter we told you we expected none. We had some in the flash network as demand was weaker there. We also had some in the 8-inch logic network; nothing in the 12-inch network for processors or chipsets. Looking to Q3 I would say we probably have a little bit in the older networks, nothing in the newer networks. 
Chris Delaney - JP Morgan
 In the yearly gross margin guidance, are you guys assuming some continued problems on margins from the NOR Flash business? 
 Andy Bryant
Am I anticipating it? First, no. If anything I think it gets boy, I hate to say a little better, but let's say a little better. Because of the weakness in the second quarter we had some reserves, we have a high unit cost because we had less full factories, we had the under load charges, I think we've gotten the business resized right where we want it so we shouldn't see extraordinary bad news. I would say business as usual through the back half of the year.

Our next question comes from Hans Mosesmann – Moors & Cabot. 
Hans Mosesmann – Moors & Cabot
 Thank you. Paul, why did desktops do a lot better than expected? Is this a result of Vista? Is it market share gains? Is it demand you were going to see in Q3 that got pulled into Q2? Can you explain? 
 Paul Otellini
The principal upside we saw in desktops this quarter was in the channel, and as Andy pointed out and I think I mentioned in my comments too, our channel sales were actually up sequentially this quarter in a seasonally down quarter. The bulk of our products sold through the channel is desktop product which principally is non-U.S., non-Western Europe markets. So if I were to say one large chunk of upside was in the emerging market desktops. 
Secondly, we increased our business in some of the low end segments of the desktop business at the OEMs. Going forward since that is so competitive, we're going to be very selective about what business we take there from a margin perspective. 
Hans Mosesmann – Moors & Cabot
As follow-on, if you can give us a sense of ASPs in notebooks and servers in the quarter: were they up, flat, down? 
 Paul Otellini
I don't think I want to go farther than what I said, which was that we saw strength, that our technology position in those two segments allowed us to somewhat offset the pricing pressures in the low end of the PC market. 
Operator
 Our next question comes from Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America. 
 Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America
 Good afternoon, guys. Andy, a question for you. The 45 nanometer product cost that you expect will have an impact on gross margin, help us understand if that's not normally incorporated as part of your start-up cost projections earlier on in the year? 
 Andy Bryant
 No. The start-up costs are the costs incurred before you begin production. When you have what I call prequalified production costs, the odd part of our accounting is until I can be relatively sure I can sell the product or the product is going to be good, we don't value it, so it ends up going as a period cost. 
However, if the product we build is good, we will sell it in the fourth quarter so we'll be selling from previously reserved material is my guess. Again, that's just making sure you don't value product you can't sell, and we just haven't crossed those hurdles yet. 
This is pretty typical with the new process. You go back over the years, you'll see every second year or so we end up with one quarter where we have a bit of a dip in gross margin followed by the valuation quarter where you get a pretty good uplift. 
 Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America
 I can't remember if you quantified this earlier in the call, but did you quantify how much this particular factor is impacting gross margin? 
 Andy Bryant
 What I said was it is 1 to 2 points. 
 Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America
The other question I had for you, Paul, you commented on the pricing and you said it is a little different, it is relegated to the low end value desktops and some parts of notebook. But as you look forward, are you expecting an environment where there is some pressure in Q3 commensurate with what you saw in Q2 because at the end of Q1 when you reported first quarter you sounded more optimistic about the pricing environment. 
Paul Otellini
I think we've got two trends here, as Andy pointed out. One is the continuing competitive nature of the low end of the PC marketplace. Offsetting that in places where our technology lead is really gaining some significant traction, differentiation in the marketplace. 
So obviously we're trying to move as fast as possible towards a product mix that reflects the latter. At the same time there is still a big chunk of the market out there that lives in that very competitive space. We have built the integral of that into our forecast in terms of what we expect for the second half. 
Operator
 Our next question is from Joseph Osha - Merrill Lynch. 
Joseph Osha - Merrill Lynch
First, on your NOR flash business I am wondering, is there an attempt here to maybe focus a little bit more on profitability? Did you walk away from some business this quarter? 
 Andy Bryant
 No. We would have taken almost any business that moved in this quarter. We're still very aggressively pushing parts and trying to sell. It is just that our end markets were softer than we expected. 
Joseph Osha - Merrill Lynch
Secondly, looking in particular at Penryn, smaller die, more output, when you think about latter part of this year, first part of next year, do you worry at all about the ability to absorb that output and keep utilization up without stacking up inventory? 
 Andy Bryant
 I don't believe that's a problem certainly in the latter part of this year and the first part of next year. As we always do, we adjust factories, take old factories off line which allows you to put part of the parts that was being built there into the new factories as you go forward. 
So if you look at the factory loadings today, we are pretty comfortable that the factories stay full. There will always be some disruptions. You may have a quarter where you have a month or so that you have some under loading, but in general the factories are planned pretty well to what we see as demand. 
Joseph Osha - Merrill Lynch
Can you maybe give us a slightly longer-term look at how you're targeting operating expenses? I am interested in maybe whether there is some kind of 2008 target in monetary or percentage of revenue terms? 
 Andy Bryant
 What we have said is we would like to have minimal, if any, growth in OpEx for next year, so we're trying to keep a tight lid on it. Will it grow some? It could. We haven't done our plan yet. We haven't looked at the project list yet, but the intent is let's continue to find one more year's worth of efficiency savings to fund our growth, if at all possible. 
Joseph Osha - Merrill Lynch
 That's the whole year '08 against the whole year '07 number, that's how I should think about it? 
 Andy Bryant
 Yes, sir. 
Joseph Osha - Merrill Lynch
 Thank you very much. 
Operator
 Our next question comes from Uche Orji - UBS. 
Uche Orji - UBS
I wanted to get some clarity as to how you intend to address the low end which remains competitive, and reconcile that with margins. The question here is, are you able to manage both or are you going to be willing to cede market share in the low end in the interest of preserving margin? 
 Paul Otellini
Well, that's a real time equation Uche. You've seen us walk the line there and I think you will see us continue to walk the line in terms of what we're going after secularly. We have no intention of walking away from any segment of the computing market. That's why we spent quite a bit of time explaining our thrust towards lower cost products designed for the low end, low powered, low cost segments of the marketplace in the last analyst meeting. 
As those products come online in 2008, that gives us a significantly lower cost structure than we have today to go after these markets in an increasingly profitable fashion. So it would be crazy to walk away from them and then to try to jump back in. You will see us continue to engage where we think it makes prudent sense and leave some stuff on the table where it doesn't. 
Uche Orji - UBS
On the manufacturing side you've had so much efficiencies and we've seen your CapEx come down and congratulations for that. But let me just understand if I look at 45 nanometers as that starts to ramp, should we expect these efficiencies to continue and what kind of picture does that create in terms of how we should think about CapEx and sales on an ongoing basis for Intel? 
 Andy Bryant
 Well, we'll certainly continue to focus and drive on efficiencies. But if you ask me do I think I have another rabbit in my hat to find another $600 million savings this year? No, I don't think so. I would think of the savings we've got in this efficiency program as pretty much what we'll get for a specific generation, but every new generation leaves me, if I can maintain the improvements I've gotten, it gives me essentially $1 billion per generation forever. 
So I am trying to make sure we protect the savings we've gotten. Will we find some ways to extend it? Sure, we'll find some more ways, we'll find some more efficiencies, but I don't think it is going to be a big effect on capital this year. 
Operator
 Our next question comes from JoAnne Feeney - FTN Midwest. 
 JoAnne Feeney - FTN Midwest
A quick question for you about the ASP decline. I know you have answered a number of these, but could you enlighten us on the role of the increasing ramp of the chipset? Is that figuring into that ASP decline? Is it partly a mix shift there? 
 Andy Bryant
Not in the ASP decline we're talking about. Clearly, if you look at the gross margin percentage, chipsets don't have quite as high a margin as microprocessors and as they grow faster, there will be a bit of a mix effect, but what we've been talking about we've been pretty much focused on the microprocessors being down. So yes, there is a bit of an effect for chipsets. It is not material in terms of the explanation. 
 JoAnne Feeney - FTN Midwest
 Not in terms of the gross margin decline then, just a bit? 
 Andy Bryant
 No. 
 JoAnne Feeney - FTN Midwest
So the mix shift primarily was towards the lower end of the desktop and that's what primarily dragged down the ASPs? Is that right? 
 Andy Bryant
Well, it is certainly what Paul said before, price competition at the low end of the PC including low end retail type laptops. 
 JoAnne Feeney - FTN Midwest
Then on the CapEx side, your improved efficiencies are enabling you to drop that down by $600 million. Is it also the case then that you're able to run the fabs at higher capacity utilization? Is that an implication that we should draw from this lowered CapEx level? 
 Andy Bryant
 A little bit, yes. Again, it is not a big number, but when you're talking about a factory that costs $3.5 billion to $4 billion, small improvements mean more dollars. 
Operator
 Our next question comes from Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers. 
 Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers
 Thank you so much. Just on the NOR side, just to go back to that, when you're saying that you feel that margin wise it may be business as usual, should we then think that the operating loss level will be broadly similar in the second half to the way they were -- that $280 million to $290 million level -- that it was in the first couple of quarters or should we be thinking about a change there? 
 Andy Bryant
 Paul, we're not making a segment forecast for cash for Q3 and Q4. What you should be thinking of is we'll continue to fight for revenue. This is on the NOR side, what you're seeing is NOR and NAND combined. 
NAND, you will see us continue to fight for revenue. You will see us continue to try to protect and grow that business. We are trying to form a new company with it. We don't want to decimate it. The accounting will make it a bit odd. 
Remember in the NOR business once we've agreed to form the new companies and sell assets to the new companies, accounting then stops depreciating those assets, so you are actually going to see some good news because you will have less costs because of less depreciation. The spending will be pretty constant, and again, the revenue will determine how good we are at finding customers. 
 Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers
 Also, just on the inventory side, in describing your expectation of being fairly flattish through the coming quarter, given the sort of seasonal fourth quarter ramp, isn't that fairly unusual for you to keep the third quarter inventory flattish? How should we think about framing expectations there or your comfort level in terms of the inventory levels? 
 Andy Bryant
With a forecast of inventory flat, if I can maintain flat that says we have continued to improve inventory efficiency and usage, so there is work I still have to do, we still have to do, in order to maintain that. I would expect it to grow in the fourth quarter, but I would like to see us continue to focus on the gains we've gotten in throughput, continue to take those to the bottom line in terms of inventory control which will mean more revenue with no more inventory. 
 Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers
 Lastly, just for Paul, on the service side, I was wondering if you would give some color given that you have quite a broad product ramp and the competitor also has a new product coming out at some point in the second half and just your expectations for maybe the market demand, but also how you figure ASPs may begin to trend there in that arena? Thank you. 
 Paul Otellini
 Well, I think the overall trend in server ASPs is likely to be one where they erode a bit, principally driven by the market shifting from MP-based servers to DP-based servers over time; or more precisely, DP out growing the MP section of the market so it becomes a higher percentage. The DP server chips from us and others sell for substantially less than the MP server chips just like the systems do. 
Part of this is you have got a mix shift inside of servers towards DP that had been accelerated by the introduction and ramp of the Quad Core DP, which essentially a cheap eight-way system, and I really think that trend, along with virtualization in the data center are really the large secular trends to watch over the second half and even into 2008. 
 Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers
With any type of marginal revenue expectation that we should be aware of? 
 Paul Otellini
I suggested earlier that I think that one of the reasons we're optimistic about the second half in the numbers we've given is the expansion that we expect in mobile and in servers. 
Operator
 Our next question comes from the line of Cody Acree - Stifel Nicolaus. 
Cody Acree - Stifel Nicolaus
Thanks, guys. With your yields as strong as they were this quarter, with throughput up, pretty decent unit volumes and maybe a surprise in the decreases in inventories, internal and external, are you incrementally a little more comfortable in that second half gross margin expansion? Or is any of that breathing room just simply being offset by pricing? 
 Andy Bryant
I always say I have more comfort in my second half, only because I was comfortable with how Q2 came out. No one has even asked about the Q2 margin, but if you look under the covers, what you find is the gross margin percentage for the microprocessor business was as expected, and flash took the company down a point. So given I have that data point behind me, given the information you just described, I am more comfortable with my cost forecast. We have a seasonal second half. I am pretty comfortable with that. I am more comfortable with that second half margin, yes. 
Cody Acree - Stifel Nicolaus
With AMD's Barcelona, with your upcoming Penryn, I think others have mentioned you really should both have somewhat of a more respectable product offering. Do you believe that there is more of an equilibrium that some of your OEMs are going to push you and AMD toward, that you start to get some real diminishing returns on this pricing battle back and forth that you guys both have had? 
 Paul Otellini
 I think that the overwhelming issue for our customers is how they compete with each other in the marketplace, and to me that means particularly in the segments where the high performance matters. In the professional notebooks and the server space, not having the best product is a huge penalty in terms of their ability to gain market share or sell product. 
So I look at the relative product lines of us versus others in the second half of this year and see us in those segments much stronger. Therefore, I think that it is in our customer's best interests to be able to use our products simply because it helps them sell against each other. The alternative is that they will be selling a product with less performance potentially at less price, but that equation doesn't fly as well in the performance-oriented segments of the marketplace. 
In these two particular segments, DP servers and professional notebooks, it is not just performance that matters, it is the power efficiency. You will see us extend our lead in power efficiency from where it is today over the second half of this year as we bring out the 45 nanometer based products. 
I feel pretty comfortable that if they intend to do well in the marketplace they are best served in these performance-based segments using Intel. 
Operator
 Our next question comes from Brian Piccioni - BMO Capital Markets. 
Brian Piccioni - BMO Capital Markets
With respect to the NOR flash business, are you in a position to provide us with any sort of enhanced detail with respect to how that will affect your operating model into 2008? 
 Andy Bryant
No more than what Stacy has already communicated, but I can reiterate. We would expect revenue to be down when that business is sold off. We would expect gross margin percentage to be up, it could be 1 to 2 points. We would expect spending to be down a little bit, and our share of the gains or losses of that newly formed company likely come back to us in the gains and losses from investments, so it basically says probably the bottom line doesn't change much in the short term, the operating lines of the P&L are a bit improved. 
Brian Piccioni - BMO Capital Markets
You sound very confident in this particular call about introduction of your 45 nanometer parts later on in the year. I was wondering if you would be able to provide us with any milestones to look forward to with respect to the progress you would be making in that segment? 
 Paul Otellini
We are sampling all versions of the product to-date: notebook, desktop, and server. So that's a milestone that I think we've talked about before but one which is important because if you're confident enough to sample the customer base, particularly at the high-end of the server products, that's a good sign. 
The next milestone you will hear from us is probably something we'll talk about at IDF in September which I will allude to later on in my closing remarks. You will see a bit more of the product line there. The final milestone is when we start shipping the darn things. 
Operator
Our next question comes from David Wu - Global Crown Capital. 
David Wu - Global Crown Capital
Paul, when I look at the stuff that's going on in retail notebooks, your Pentium Duo, it seems to me has as good a price point as any out of the competition, and yet the competition appears to have higher unit growth in that segment. In your mind, why would the OEMs push their versions versus your version? 
For Andy, can you help us a little bit on the NOR business? Because I look at your break out by segment and the losses aren't materially higher in Q2 versus Q1 for the flash business. I just wondered where that 1 percentage point gross margin hit took place. Can you also give us at least a rough guess at what's the mix between the NOR and the NAND in the current reported numbers? 
 Andy Bryant
 Which one do you want first? 
David Wu - Global Crown Capital
The simple one. 
 Andy Bryant
 Which? 
 Paul Otellini
 Both of them. Let me answer the retail question. There are a couple of things going on here, David. First of all, you're right. Pentium Duo is in our view a superior product to the competitors at those price points. It's got lower power, longer battery life, higher performance, et cetera. So we believe that it ought to outsell for that low end of the retail range, and in fact it is doing quite well in a worldwide retail basis. 
For reasons that you need to ask our customers about, we tend to do much better in their line-ups offshore than we do on-shore. If you were to go to Europe or go to Japan or go to China, you would see a much stronger Intel mix in those low end segments of the notebooks than you do at Best Buy or the stores here in the United States. 
For the life of me I can't figure out why that happens, although we tend to try to explain to customers that the product is better. 
 Andy Bryant
The NOR versus NAND business, first of all, we don't break out the reporting segment at a sub segment level, so I am not going to split the two for you. In a reconciliation of margins from Q1 to Q2, flash is not a reconciling item. Versus our expectation of where we thought Q2 was coming out flash is a reconciling item. So our expectation going into the quarter was NOR would kind of hold its own and NAND would improve. NAND did improve. It had reasonable revenue growth and a better environment, so we were pleased with that. NOR deteriorated. 
What happened was the NOR demand dropped. We had under loaded factory charges; we had a higher cost per unit of products sold because we had under loading factories. We had demand reserves because products built for specific customers no longer were being taken by those customers. 
So all those things together add up to about a point of margin versus our expectation. Quarter to quarter, the entire change was essentially microprocessor related. 
Operator
 Our next question comes from Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank. 
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
You mentioned about the performance being the determining factor in winning designs with your customers. It appeared that took place in the first quarter and second quarter, at least on a unit basis, with you gaining share. Given that your competitor doesn't seem to be announcing too many new products at least for the third quarter, I just wonder why you guys would be guiding in line with normal seasonality if market share gains seem to be something you pulled off in the last couple of quarters? 
 Paul Otellini
 Well, I didn't make any comments on market share in the second quarter and I have learned that the best thing to do is to avoid that if possible and let the market research people opine after the fact. That's the easier way to deal with the ins and outs of inventory draws and large replenishments. 
What you'll see us do, particularly in notebooks in the second half of the year, is move all of our advertising back from establishing Core 2 Duo on as a brand on a worldwide basis where it has been for the last year; the last 12 months, 100% of our own Intel advertising has been based upon that and you'll see it swing to Centrino almost entirely. 
Our view is that we're going to hit that real hard in the second half starting in the August timeframe on the web and in print and in television, focusing on the benefits of the product line as expressed to end users in terms of the battery life and so forth. We are optimistic it will have a positive impact. 
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
 Maybe a follow-up on the channel side of things. You mentioned that that was a positive in the quarter for you and actually grew, which is better than seasonal. Do you think that's you taking share in the channel or just the channel being stronger than the OEM side? 
 Paul Otellini
I think the channel had a good quarter first of all. , and our channel customers tell me that they are making very good margins on Intel products which is a combination of the strength of the product line and the stability around the pricing and the predictability around the pricing. 
If you look at things like the gray market on our products, it is actually very close to our pricing now which allows our distributors and the dealers to make good margins. I think that's been the single biggest impact this quarter and that, plus the fact that the emerging markets were relatively strong where they tend to play well. 
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
 Then a final quick one, you mentioned last quarter that there was a little bit of excess inventory floating around in the microprocessor space. I think you said it wasn't Intel inventory. Do you get the sense that that's been cleaned up heading into the third quarter or just an update on the status of that would be helpful. 
 Paul Otellini
 Well, ours has certainly been cleaned up and is in very good shape as we talked about. I think there remains to be seen what others will say. The rumor out there is that the inventory in other parts of the channel is a bit long right now. 
Operator
 Our final question comes from Krishna Shankar - JMP Securities. 
 Krishna Shankar - JMP Securities
 Paul, you talked about the difference in pricing and performance between the low and the high end. Can you give us some sense for the growth rate of the low end notebook and server segment versus the high end? I just want to get a sense for relative growth rates, especially with performance being very competitive now in low end consumer notebooks? 
 Paul Otellini
 Well, I actually don't think the latter part of your sentence is correct. I don't think there is an equivalent level of performance or at least energy efficient performance in the low end of the marketplace. I think we still tend to do well there. 
But you're asking me for a mix question which is a level of granularity I can't give you and it gets really to the ASP question that we've discussed at length today; so I am afraid I can't help you there. Clearly it is in our best interest to drive those two segments as aggressively as possible and that's what we're doing. 
Kevin Sellers 
 Thanks, Krishna. Thanks, Melanie. We're going to just close our call now and as we do so I am going to turn the time over to Paul for a few brief closing comments. Thanks. 
Go ahead, Paul. 
 Paul Otellini
Thanks, Kevin. Thank you all for your questions today. As I said at our analyst meeting in May, we plan to extend our technology leadership in the second half by ramping the industry's first 45 nanometer manufacturing line along with Penryn, a complete family of 45 nanometer processors. 
Beyond that, we are far along in developing the Nehalem micro architecture for 2008. Within our 45 nanometer generation, you'll see us extend the reach of Intel architecture into mobile Internet devices, consumer electronics, and parallel processing with new designs based upon the new Silverthorn and Larabee cores. We're very excited about the future of our technology, and I hope to see many of you at the Intel developer's forum in September where you will learn more about our initiatives. 
Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us.

Thanks Kevin. The first quarter marked another solid period for our microprocessor business. Units were inline with seasonal patterns and ASPs held up well despite competitive pricing in the low price segments of the market. 
In general, we saw a flat quarter-to-quarter pricing in mobile and desktop segments, and a decline in server ASPs driven by a shift to dual and uniprocessor servers. We continue to see strong demand for our core micro-architectural processors all of which continue to ramp nicely. 
We’re pleased with our operating performance, with lower microprocessor unit costs, higher margins, good inventory management and lower spending resulting from our structural cost efforts, which are running ahead of our projections. Flash was weaker however, driven by lower NOR units and NAND pricing. 
The desktop segment was competitive this quarter but our pricing held firm as we shipped more Conroe processors in the first quarter than in the second half of 2006. We are very pleased with the momentum of our vPro processor technology, which adds a number of security and manageability features for IT and is now being deployed at over 200 companies and organizations. 
In mobile, we are shipping product in preparation for next month's launch of the new Santa Rosa platform with volume shipments of the new Crestline chipset and continued strong demand for our Merom processor. The platform will be branded Intel Centrino Duo for consumers and Intel Centrino Pro for businesses that want to deploy the benefits of our vPro technology in mobile as well. 
Our server platforms also continue to shift to new technology, with another quarter of growth for Woodcrest and a near doubling of Clovertown quad-core shipments. Our belief is that maintaining scale is essential through our strategy of ramping new manufacturing and platform technologies quickly, delivering high performance and low-unit costs. 
Today's product leadership is built around our 65 nanometer technologies and we are well along the path to introduce products based upon 45 nanometer technology later this year. To that end, we've announced the use of breakthrough materials in our 45 nanometer process that will allow us to introduce faster and more power-efficient microprocessors to pack more features into smaller die. 
We have disclosed this week that our Penryn family of processors will offer leadership performance with gains of 15% to well over 45%, when compared to today's best Core 2 Duo and Xeon processors. Cache sizes will be 50% larger, yet die sizes will be 25% smaller. We have six different microprocessors already running based upon this process, and they are running a broad base of applications on five operating systems. 
We also disclosed plans for Nehalem, our next generation micro-architecture for 45 nanometers, which will take our performance, power and cost leadership even further beginning in 2008. 
In summary, the R&D cadence that we discussed at last April's analysts meeting is providing us with the very best products in the marketplace giving a strong momentum and relatively stable pricing in a competitive business environment. We are seeing good progress on unit cost and spending reductions. And our strong execution of 65 nanometers is being followed up by an innovative 45 nanometer technology and products. We are planning for growth in the second half of the year and look forward to sharing our future plans at our New York analysts meeting. 
With that let me turn the call over to Andy 
Andy Bryant
Thanks Paul. This is another quarter of progress, marked by products, well received by customers, major advances in process and manufacturing technologies and comprehensive cost savings. Gross margins for the quarter was better than we expected and we can report excellent results over the last year in cutting spending, which is $0.5 billion lower than the first quarter of 2006. 
Looking beyond the transitional second quarter, we see an improving second half as the distinctive products and process technologies catered date. We expect gross margins to improve significantly in the second half with a percentage in lower 50's range and we have raised our forecast for the full year. 
Revenue for the first quarter was $8.9 billion, within the range forecast in January and down 9% from the fourth quarter. The total number of microprocessor units was down and approximately seasonal. Average selling prices for microprocessors were slightly lower overall. Unit volumes of chipsets, motherboards, and flash memory were lower than the fourth quarter. 
More than half of total revenue $4.8 billion came from the Digital Enterprise Group. Revenue for this group was approximately 8% lower than the fourth quarter, primarily due to lower unit volume from sales of microprocessors and chipsets. 
The Mobility Group accounted for more than a third of total revenue. This revenue of $3.3 billion was down 8% from the fourth quarter, primarily due to lower unit volumes of microprocessors. 
Compared to a year ago, total revenue was approximately flat. Revenue from the Digital Enterprise and Flash Memory groups was lower and revenue from the Mobility Group was higher. 
Gross margin dollars were $4.4 billion, $378 million lower than the fourth quarter. Gross margin percentage of 50.1% was above the midpoint of our forecast and 0.5% higher than the fourth quarter. 
While lower revenue and higher manufacturing start-up costs reduced gross margins, this was more than offset by increases in gross margins due to lower microprocessor unit cost and the sale of previously reserved products and inventory. In a year-to-year comparison, gross margin percentage is five points lower than the first quarter of 2006, primarily a result of lower average selling prices for microprocessors. 
R&D and MG&A were approximately $2.7 billion, in line with the forecast and down 6% from the fourth quarter. In addition, we had restructuring and asset impairment charges of $75 million. The progress we have made in cutting expenses is most apparent in a year-to-year comparison. 
Spending for R&D and MG&A is down 17% from the first quarter of 2006. And as a percent of revenue, spending has declined by nearly six points. The number of employees is down by more than 11,000 or 11% to 92,000. 
Interest and other income is significantly lower than the fourth quarter, when we realized a gain of $482 million from the sale of the Company's communications and application processor business. 
The provision for taxes in the first quarter was also significantly lower as it included a reversal of previously accrued taxes of approximately $300 million. Fully diluted earnings per share were $0.27. Reversal of previously accrued taxes accounted for about $0.05 out of the $0.27. 
On the balance sheet, total inventories were approximately flat with the fourth quarter. Finished goods were down, while work in process and raw materials were up. 
Total cash investments comprised of cash, short-term investments, and fixed income trading assets, ended the quarter at $8.6 billion, nearly $1 billion less than the fourth quarter. Capital spending was $1.4 billion, dividends payments were $650 million, and stock repurchases were $400 million. 
As we turn now to the outlook for the second quarter, please keep in mind that unless otherwise specified, the forecasts do not include the effect of any new acquisitions, divestitures or similar transactions that may be completed after April 15. 
I will use the midpoint of forecast ranges while making comparisons to specific periods. We are planning for revenue, which is typically lower in the second quarter to be between $8.2 billion and $8.8 billion. The mid-point of this range would be a decrease of 4% for the first quarter. On a year-to-year basis, the outlook anticipates growth of 6%. Our expectation for gross margin percentage in the second quarter is 48%, plus or minus a couple of points. 
Lower revenue overall, lower sell-through and previously reserved products and higher start-up costs will reduce gross margins from the first quarter, partially offset by continuing progress and reducing unit costs and lower under-load charges. 
Spending for R&D and MG&A in the second quarter should be approximately $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion, approximately flat with the first quarter. In addition, in the separate category for restructuring and asset impairment charges, we expect expenses of approximately $60 million. While we have no full year forecast for this category, we do expect to continue to incur charges as we restructure this company as a part of our program to improve financial performance. 
For the full year, manufacturing start-up costs will be concentrated in the first half as we discussed in January. These start-up costs will be lower in the third quarter than in the second, and this change should contribute at least an additional two points to gross margin in the third quarter. 
Due to the lower unit costs and permanent average selling prices for microprocessors in the first and second quarters than we previously expected, we are raising the forecast for gross margin for the full year to 51%, plus or minus a few points. 
The results for the first quarter combined with the outlook for the second pointed gross margin for the first half of 49%. That would imply the margin for the second half of the year would be between 52% and 54%, with the expectation that the fourth quarter is a bit higher than the third. 
We have also adjusted the outlook for spending on R&D and MG&A for the full year. R&D spending is now forecasted to be approximately $5.6 billion, $200 million higher than the prior forecast. And MG&A spending is now forecasted to be approximately $5.1 billion; $200 million lower than the prior forecast. 
Our tax rate for each of the remaining quarters in the year is now expected to be 31%. 
The results for the quarter and our current outlook appear to be a good beginning for 2007. Business remains competitive and it is essential that we remain focused on the right priorities. Deliver products that customers find compelling. Execute superbly with 45-nanometer. Attack costs on all fronts in the factories, in R&D and in MG&A. The goal is steady progress and increasing returns, based on successfully bringing technology customers want to the marketplace. 
With that, let me turn it back to Kevin. 
Kevin Sellers
Okay. Thank you, Andy. So, we would now like to open the lines for questions and answers, and let me turn it over to you for that. 
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you very much, sir. (Operator Instructions). And our first question comes from the line of Uche Orji of UBS, New York. Please proceed. 
Uche Orji - UBS, New York
Thank you very much. Just two questions, First, if I look at your ASPs for the quarter, I'd like to say they have held up well. If I look further down the line, with the new products you have, despite that you raised your gross margin expectation for the second half. What is implied in the pricing environment within that side? 
Paul Otellini
We certainly think we continue to see a competitive price environment. But if you think back, over the last year, starting mid-last year as the new products were introduced into the desktop server and mobile segments, we started to see our products differentiate themselves from the competitor. 
As time passes, as we extend those products into the product stack, we think we have more than just price to compete on. So we find ourselves in a better position than we were a year ago. We think it held up pretty well in the first quarter and we raised margin percentage for the year. 
Uche Orji - UBS, New York
Thank you very much. One more question, on inventory, first of all how much of the inventory that was reserved that was sold in the first quarter, the impact it had on the margin. Are you able to help us quantify that, so we can get a sense of what the gross margin was for the quarter? 
Paul Otellini
Sure I can. I'll let you do a piece now, let me give another speech. And I am going to answer your question, from Q4 to Q1, margins were up slightly. I want to break the margin change into some pieces though. Let's talk about the ongoing business. You sell products, you make products, you have mix changes, you have pricing. If you take the normal running of the business with a revenue graph of 9%, you would normally expect margins to be down. 
Based on the strength of the lower cost per unit, margins on the basic running of the business were up 1 percentage point Q4 to Q1. That's step one. 
Now, we have some other things that we had to put in there. We sold some previously reserved inventory. Essentially all in the microprocessor space, all in the digital equipment side, the pack (inaudible). In that space, we picked up one point of good news margin because we sold products that had been previously reserved. 
We had one point of good news in the first quarter on under-load charges versus Q4. So the under-load charges in Q4 were higher than Q1. So that gives you three points of good news from those three elements. 
Then we knew that startup costs were going to increase. Startup costs in the first quarter were just under three percentage points, a bad news to gross margin in the first quarter. So running the business a little bit better, selling previously reserved inventory a little bit better, under-load charges are a little bit better, almost completely offset by startup costs. 
Uche Orji - UBS, New York
That's great. Thank you very much. That's helpful. 
Operator
Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Cody Acree of Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed. 
Cody Acree - Stifel Nicolaus
Thank you. Andy, could you just clarify startup costs were 3, you said you had ongoing startup costs that you would normally have Q-to-Q. With the three percentage points higher than those, what would be an ongoing roll in startup cost? 
Andy Bryant
Yes, what we have said in the past is you typically get about two percentage points of margin deterioration for startup costs. Essentially think of it as three points on top of the normal. 
Cody Acree - Stifel Nicolaus
Okay. Very good. And then into Q3, you expect that to get to about two percentage points, so we step up again in Q2. That's your largest, that's going to be your peak spending. Do you have any quantification there? 
Andy Bryant
Sure. It is the same log we just did that for Q1 to Q2, this is a forecast for Q2. So the revenues steps down some. As that happens, as you put all the things then, mix, unit costs, everything. Margins, we dropped about two points with that decline in revenue. 
We then don't have the benefit of previously reserved inventory. That would depress margins down one point, because of the offset of the first quarter. Startup costs will be one point worse in the second quarter versus the first quarter. So that gives you, about five points of bad news. 
The offset is under-load charges by two points better in the second quarter versus the first quarter. So, business, with two points, previously reserved and startup costs with a point each, that's four, not five, as I said. And then two points for good news or under-load which is why our margins are down two points in the second quarter. 
From that point, I expect to see at least two maybe more points of margin improvement in the third quarter, just for the startup costs alone. 
Cody Acree - Stifel Nicolaus
Perfect. Alright, thanks Andy, for that. And then lastly, the microarchitecture percentage of revenue as you are moving more into these cost benefits. Can you give us about where you stand? And when that crossover is? And maybe how we can proceed into the Q2 and Q3? 
Andy Bryant
Sorry, talking about the percentage of new products on the new architecture we started shipping last year? 
Cody Acree - Stifel Nicolaus
Yes. 
Andy Bryant
Point that we are making now its -- 
Paul Otellini
Everything today is on 65 nanometers, it’s essentially all core based or derivates of the core based products that are being run through the line now. 
Cody Acree - Stifel Nicolaus
That's being run through the line now but, what about on percentage of revenue now? 
Andy Bryant
Again it will be the vast majority. If I look at my inventory and I try to look at how many of the older architecture products, it's a very small percentage. 
Cody Acree - Stifel Nicolaus
Okay. And then last and I will go away. Santa Rosa launch, do you expect or can we anticipate any kind of volatility of orders, pre-launch/post-launch, I guess what are you guys aiming for? 
Andy Bryant
As I said in my commentary, we are shipping product today to our OEM customers in advent to that launch. So, they can build their systems for the launch in May. So, this was all programmed in. We haven't seen and nor are we anticipating a stall in front of the launch, if that's what you are trying to get at. We do think there's a lot of excitement around these products. Particularly around the Centrino Pro version which brings vPro into the notebook segment for the first time. 
When you look at how corporations deploy vPro technology, they like to deploy it in large swaps at once. So, making sure that all their employees both mobile and tethered to the desktop have access to their technology is a prerequisite for deployment. 
Cody Acree - Stifel Nicolaus
Alright. Thanks guys. 
Operator
Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung of Citigroup. Please proceed. 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
Thanks. Nice job on the quarter guys. Question, I want to ask first is on the revenue outlook for the second quarter. Down at 4%, it looks just slightly below normal seasonal, and wanted to get a read on why you see that? And in particular, your thoughts on NOR flash, which fell, possibly in the first quarter and I assume will fall again in Q2? 
Andy Bryant
You take it as down 4%; we take that slightly on the low end of the seasonality average, seasonal for us. We think it is between three and four. No cosmic reason, we do resist a little overhang of some competitive products out there that we have to be content with, that could have some effect. As far as, the forecast for NOR, I really don't want to give forecasts of the sub-business unit lines. We all know it has been a struggle in the flash business and it continues to be a competitive business market right now. 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
And just to clarify, the initial statement. So, obviously we know Andy is sitting on a boatload of parts that are still out there. You are suggesting as you are dealing with that competitively via price, via units, combination of both? 
Andy Bryant
Again, our assumption is there is some excess inventory out to [supplier] and that does, maybe get worked up and it does disrupt the marketplace. Not a big one by the way. Remember, we are talking about 4% versus 3 point something percent down. So, we just think it's a small disruption we have to deal with. 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
Okay. And my second question is on the outlook for operating expenses, because you made the point that you're a quarter early on the headcount reduction at a minimum. And I wonder if you have any sense as, should we be thinking the $2 billion, $1 billion OpEx savings that you had told us we would see over this year or next year might shift a little bit earlier given you are ahead of plan on headcount? 
Andy Bryant
I wouldn't go that far that fast. What we have committed for the year is a combined operating expense of 10.7. We guess we'll hold to that. If we do find a little bit of upbeat in the efficiency, it gives Paul the ability to look at other projects that he might want to think about. So I would think of it holding pretty firm to the 10.7. 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
Okay. And Paul just a quick follow-up on our first question, any thoughts on the NOR business here, losses are getting greater, I know you've talked in the past about maybe getting out of that business if you couldn't earn a profit, it doesn't look like you are doing a good job here? 
Paul Otellini
Profits certainly eluded us in that business in the first quarter and a lot of that had to do with the very competitive environment in NOR, from a pricing standpoint and an overall stated demand standpoint. We have the team who are 100% focused right now on switching products to general purpose channel products away from some of the OEM customers to try to bring in more of that business that will drive us to breakeven point faster. Our plan right now is to get this business profitable. 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
Okay. Thanks very much. 
Operator
Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of John Lau of Jefferies & Company. Please proceed. 
John Lau - Jefferies & Company
Great, thank you. I just wanted to circle back to you with regards to your estimates on gross margin. It's certainly much higher for the full year. And in your thoughts about that, I was wondering if you can give us a little insight as to your assumptions of what the pricing environment would be for the second half of the year and also what the overall growth for the PC market will be by this 2007? Thank you. 
Andy Bryant
I can't give do that with granularity John. What we did see was as Paul said prices held up pretty well for the first quarter a little better than we expected. We think we are starting to see some benefits of the strengths of the product line that is certainly included in our thinking as we think about the year. But I also want to point out the good news in unit costs. The focus on efficiency programs improving throughput cost and cutting overhead inside the factory is paying off. It's a combination of two. Some things that are happening at Intel right now that I think are good for us. 
John Lau - Jefferies & Company
And as a follow-up, there have been some quite dramatic pre-announcements from your competition with regards to what the comments on the resale channel. Have you seen that significant amount of pick-up in market share, did you gain market share into those certain markets in Q1? 
Paul Otellini
Well, I think we'll let the market share forecasters forecast the market share when all the numbers are in, because we haven't seen all the data. I will comment though that we had a very strong quarter in the channel in Q1, and that is in the face of what is normally or seasonally a down channel quarter as well. And I think that is not a matter of just pricing as was evidenced in our ASPs, particularly on desktop. The channel was very, very strong on selling Conroe, which is the Core 2 Duo desktop product. 
John Lau - Jefferies & Company
Great, thank you. 
Operator
Thank you very mush, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Chris Caso of Friedman, Billings Ramsey. Please proceed. 
Chris Caso - Friedman, Billings Ramsey
Hi thank you. I wonder if you can give some detail on what impact we might expect from the introduction of the 45 nanometer product in the second half, specifically on gross margin impact, you talked about 25% smaller die size, do you expect that have any material effect on gross margins this year and if not maybe you can talk a little bit about what we might expect in the 2008? 
Andy Bryant
When you start a new process you typically have a little bit of variation, and it comes with it because you have the start-up cost that you're dealing with now. Then before the product gets called you have the pre-quality reserves and then you’re quick valuing at a point in time. So, when we get into the Q2, I will give a better forecast of when those products may qualify and when you might start to see the inventory being valued and the costing marginal effect. So, I guess, I am telling you, I am not going to give you many specifics about that. Yes, we think the cost envelope for those products can be very competitive, we feel pretty good about where those are headed. But I think again for this year, it's more inventory valuation in fact and costing effect. 
Chris Caso - Friedman, Billings Ramsey
Right. Okay, from a technical side on a performance basis, you talked about the fact that you would increase the cache size in those 45 nanometer products? Should we also expect then to see higher clock speeds out of those, well can you talk a little bit about what we can expect performance wise on the 45 nanometer processors? 
Andy Bryant
Sure. Let me back up a bit though, Chris and it can be the perspective. If you may recall at the last Analyst Meeting last April. I talked about a new cadence for development and deployment of technology right, where we would continue our two year technology deployment of silicon generations, and then have an alternative year cadence of new micro-architectures. And that we would ramp new silicon technologies with shrink sort of slight improvements of the existing micro-architecture to be able to ramp very quickly with the high performance product to small die size, which you saw in '06 was that new micro-architecture coming in on 65 nanometers, which you will see starting at the end of this year, with the beginning of the 45 nanometer shipments are derivatives of that micro-architecture shrunk if you will to 45 nanometers with some new instructions, with some new feature sets, with some larger cache and with some faster clock speed. 
All that combines to give us a nice boost in performance, and I give you a range of 15% to 45% depending on the application type and the product type. So, we are seeing a nice boost on the performance side, as well as a decrease, a significant decrease in die size. 
Chris Caso - Friedman, Billings Ramsey
Okay. And just may be last question, with regard to the ramp of those 45-nanometer products. I guess it's early, would you expect that to be about as fast, may be faster or slower than the ramp of the Core 2 Dual product or family of products. 
Andy Bryant
It will be at least as fast as the 65-nanometer ramp was. 
Chris Caso - Friedman, Billings Ramsey
Okay, great. Thank you. 
Operator
Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Tim Luke of Lehman Brothers. Please proceed. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers
Andy, just to clarify on the gross margin, you say the gross margin in the first quarter was elevated by a percentage point from the sellers previously reserved inventory. Is that correct? 
Andy Bryant
Correct. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers
And for the June period, your gross margin, vis-à-vis some of the prior models is moving to 48% perhaps a little lower, but the second half you are now raising. Could you just walk through the key things that are raised in the back half gross margin, vis-à-vis, what you were expecting previously? The first quarter gross margin if I am not mistaken was broadly in line excluding the reserve, with what you had expected and maybe -- 
Andy Bryant
No, no. I'm careful. We knew what we are doing, that's why we had a forecast. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers
Oh, you did? 
Andy Bryant
So, what's happening is we're ahead on unit cost reductions. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers
Okay. 
Andy Bryant
ASPs firmed up a little bit. If we had done the same math for everyone last time, we did for this time we'd have seen -- might keeps your margins actually a little elevated to where I thought it was at the beginning of the year. So, I believe we're seeing some good news as the operating of the business in both the first and second quarter. In the back half of the year, we expect to see, if you assume something along the lines of seasonal revenue pick up, fixed cost industry; you pick up some margin for that versus our prior expectations. 
Like I said, we're ahead on unit costs, not just in the first quarter but that stayed ahead through the year. So, we pick up a little bit of good news for that. We think the strength of the new products is starting to help us a little bit. We picked up a little good news for that. So, especially, the business is working like you and hope it would be working right now, plus you get the uplift for the start-up costs. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers
And then if I may just as a follow up, we should think about you looking to build inventory as you move into the seasonally stronger second half or how should we think about you managing your inventory levels as you move through and exit the second quarter? 
Andy Bryant
Again, what I would get for the second quarter is up marginally a little bit, not much. We do start to build some inventory for revenue uplift and that will start to happen. So you'll see some increase. In reality, I'd love to keep and play it again. I just don't think I'll quite get there. It won't be a big change. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers
Thank you very much. 
Operator
Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of David Wong of A.G. Edwards. Please proceed. 
David Wong - A.G. Edwards
Hi, thank you very much. Just a couple of clarifications on what you have said about pricing in the quarter. For notebooks, there was some amount, was it primarily stability or pricing or was it also a mix of the higher end? And similarly, when you talked about selling more Conroe, were desktop like-for-like prices roughly stable as well? 
Paul Otellini
I am not sure I understand the like-for-like. What I said was that the aggregate for notebooks and desktop was approximately flat for each of them quarter-to-quarter. There is a bit of a mix shift as we continue to drive Core 2 Duo more rapidly and more broadly into the product line. At the same time, we are also using our cost capability right now to participate pretty broadly across the market. The combination of that was flat ASPs in each of those segments. 
David Wong - A.G. Edwards
And what about for service, for identical products, can you talk -- you alluded to some amount of mix shift separating service? 
Paul Otellini
It was almost entirely a mix shift. 
David Wong - A.G. Edwards
Okay. Great. And your policy going forward, do you anticipate needing to take any pricing actions or are you finding that you are gaining share without any particular response to your competitors' pricing? 
Paul Otellini
We always have price moves scheduled in, right. And those are pretty well telegraphed across the industry. And the price moves are essential for us to be able to move our most advanced technology through the stack. So you'll see us continue to have price moves in terms of the overall average, so that really is a function of how well we can drive demand to the newer products. 
David Wong - A.G. Edwards
Great. Thank you. 
Operator
Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Joe Osha of Merrill Lynch. Please proceed. 
Joe Osha - Merrill Lynch
Hi, folks. Congratulations on the solid execution. Listen, I looked at this, your revenues flat on a year ago, your gross margins down by 500 BPs and you've added about $900 million in inventory, and you've reduced your competitor to rubble in the process. So, I look at the second half of the year, and I guess my question is, in order to get to these numbers do you need to have inventory continuing to grow faster than sales, so that you don't take anymore inventory write-down charges and capacity under absorption charges or any of these other things? I am just trying to figure out how things get even better than they are now such that you don't have this sort of continuing precession of problems absorbing your capacity. 
Andy Bryant
I am not sure what question you asked me. If you asked to me, do I have under-load charges or inventory write-down? 
Joe Osha - Merrill Lynch
Let me rephrase that. I guess the question would be, do you need these under-absorption charges and inventory write-downs to go away to get you to these numbers that you are talking about? 
Andy Bryant
Yes, of course. Our forecast assumes, if there are no under-load charges, assumes there are no unusual inventory reserves. If that doesn't happen and you do have under-load charges then you have lower margins. 
Joe Osha - Merrill Lynch
Do you need to add another? Does inventory need to go to stay 100 days or so to drive this? 
Andy Bryant
No. Inventory should be dead flat. And the same thing would happen, inventory can go up, so the same thing would happen. 
Joe Osha - Merrill Lynch
Okay. So, the follow on then is you are confident that, the 65 nanometer process technology you have, you can observe it even as you ramp your 45 nanometer process technology? 
Andy Bryant
Obviously, we think we can. If the market tops when we think then we should end up with issues. But, we actually do build plants out multiple years and in those build plants, our capacity is utilized. 
Joe Osha - Merrill Lynch
Okay. And then just, Paul, may be you can help me with this one. I assume that the thought here is that, obviously, you can't comment on your competition directly, but the market share trajectory that you've enjoyed so far as a result of your excellent execution continues for the remainder of the year? 
Paul Otellini
I kind of answered that earlier, Joe. I said that that we'll leave the market share forecasting to the forecasters. But I am pretty well convinced that when the data rolls in, in a week or so, we'll be very pleased with the answers. 
Joe Osha - Merrill Lynch
Okay. And I'm sorry, one final one. As we look at 45 nanometer, should we assume that that kind of looks like a standard Intel ramp, when we think about, when you get 65 versus 45 crossover? 
Paul Otellini
Yes. 
Joe Osha - Merrill Lynch
Okay. Thanks very much. 
Operator
Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Sumit Dhanda, Banc of America Securities. Please proceed. 
Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Securities
Yes, hi, Paul and Andy. A couple of questions. Andy, you talked about better unit cost and the fact that it's coming in. It will come in progressively better versus the augmentation for the remainder of the year. Could you sort of give us an idea relative to what you had indicated at your analyst day last April? Number one, is that a material improvement versus what you had suggested where your unit costs peaked in Q3 of last year and started to come down? And number two, is the fashion in which it comes down the same? In other words, it comes down in Q1, flattened out in Q2, and then comes down again in the back half? That's it from me. 
Andy Bryant
So, I am going to deduct most of your questions, because I am showing the data in two weeks in New York anyway. And I will show you where we are versus last year's forecast, and you'll see that the trend is the same and a little ahead. There was probably the biggest quarter-to-quarter savings in cost for the year was is in the first quarter. But we built on that in the second quarter, but not in the same manner. So, when I talked about the overall business, all pieces in, being two points versus the second quarter, part of that was good news and the unit cost versus the first quarter. So, we continue to drive costs down steadily through the year. We have got a nice big step function in the first quarter which was somewhat expected, somewhat a little bit of surprise. 
Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Securities
No, I guess on that point in terms of the unit cost benefiting you in Q2; I don't recollect you saying that. You also indicated that the under load charges going away would benefit you by two points on top of the one point benefit in Q1? 
Andy Bryant
That's correct. 
Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Securities
So, my recollection was that the total impact from under load in Q4 was only two points. I guess I'm confused because you are suggesting a total benefit of three points from under load charges going away over two quarters, but the total impact initially was only two points from recollection? 
Andy Bryant
So the charge in Q4 was more than two points. The benefit in Q1was about a point, the benefit in Q2 rounds up to two points. Again, I'm trying not to say 1.7 margin points for that. Take my word for it, it goes from two plus points in the third quarter to approximately zero in the second quarter. 
Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Securities
And the unit cost benefit in Q2 is less than a point --? 
Andy Bryant
Yes, we haven't quantified that and I don't plan to. What I think I said was, if you take all the pieces of running the business; that includes price, that includes volume and includes mix and includes unit cost, it's about two points worse in the second quarter but cost per units is a benefit. 
Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Securities
Just a couple more quick ones. You said that 65 is basically almost all of the mix at this point on a microprocessor basis. Could you give us some sense? I think your forecast was for the 90-65 mix to be about two-thirds, one-third by the end of last year. Where was this in Q1, was it less than 10% 90 nanometer, if you are thinking about the mix of the processors or was it still above 10%? 
Andy Bryant
Actually I know the answer is sitting in front of me. We are getting into some pretty arcane questions. So, I think I am going pass on this one, unless you give me a better idea of what you are after. 
Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Securities
Okay. I will let this pass. One final question, on Q2, is the forecast just basically on revenues hinging around, what seasonality typically is plus some conservatism as it relates to what the competition might do? There is nothing you could really point out from your OEM or your channel customer base would suggest that your inventory is better than any [material fashion]? 
Andy Bryant
We think our inventory is in the channels, like it is just fine and the customer's standard is fine. I wouldn't say it’s conservatism, I would say caution around what's happening in the competitive space. So, yes, we are thinking of the second quarter in terms of seasonal with some caution because we think there is a little bit of excess inventory floating around the world. 
Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Securities
Okay. Thanks very much. 
Operator
Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Krishna Shankar of JMP Securities. Please proceed. 
Krishna Shankar - JMP Securities
Yes, Paul, within the service base, is there anything unusual going on in term of this mix shift you alluded to the move from MP to DP in unit processor? Or is this just a seasonal trend? Do you see any impact from virtualization on these trends? 
Paul Otellini
I think the overall shift to DP in particular is one which is kind of the overarching trend in the industry over the last three or four years. That has picked up a bit as we've shifted to Dual and now Quad-Core products, because the Quad-Core DP is essentially a cheap 8-way, with much of the robustness and very good price performance and the power matrix are exceptional. 
So that's driving an overall trend away from MP towards DP in the industry and that's going to modulate quarter-by-quarter, but for the most part that is the trend line that we operate on. And in MP space, that really gets down to the specific customers and specific product lines and so forth. I don't know that I want to comment on our customers, except to say that this over arching trend is one that we would expect to continue over the course of the year. 
Krishna Shankar - JMP Securities
And the impact of virtualization, do you see any slower demand? 
Paul Otellini
Yes, I forgot about that one. I don't actually think that's a problem. We actually like that trend because in the short-term I think it helps to make sure that people have up-to-date hardware to be able to run those virtualized environments. Second of all, when we look at the server demand over the next three or four years, we think the fundamental issue isn't virtualization but rather adding sufficient capacity to do the job. One of the things we'll talk about in the analyst meeting in a couple of weeks is that we believe that less than 5% of the servers that need to be deployed by 2010 are operating in the market today. So, we still see significant growth in servers despite a fairly positive trend around virtualization, which helps make it more efficient. 
Krishna Shankar - JMP Securities
And my final question is on Vista. It sounds like it didn't really have any positive impact on Q1. What's your outlook for the second half of the year and what the market reception is to Vista loaded PCs? 
Paul Otellini
Well my view hasn't changed from this call a quarter ago, which is that in the corporate space, I believe most companies will act like Intel, by doing some pilots and testing today. But the deployment will actually happen when the service pack gets released in the fourth quarter timeframe, probably in the October, November timeframe. 
Most companies we believe are buying machines that are Vista ready today, if you will at the enterprise level and we think that's one of the advantages of the vPro ramps that we'll talk more about in two weeks at the analyst meeting. In terms of consumers, essentially all the new consumer SKUs are Vista. So, right now that is driving the numbers. 
Krishna Shankar - JMP Securities
Thank you.

Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann of Nollenberger Capital. Please proceed. 
Hans Mosesmann - Nollenberger Capital
Thanks. My questions have been answered. 
Operator
Thank you very much, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Masdea of Credit Suisse. Please proceed. 
Michael Masdea - Credit Suisse
Yes, thanks a lot. Andy you mentioned the major core differentiation, I mean you are seeing in your products that will certainly pay off a little bit. I guess the questions around that are, what are the key differentiating areas for either you or Paul and also does that ultimately long-term change your cadence back to a level that we saw in the past, or does this cadence that you guys have established sort of stay around for good? 
Andy Bryant
Let me try that one Michael. I think the near-term differentiation is clearly performance, performance reward and the activity we have done on segmentation optimization, in our power envelopes and those kinds of things at the microprocessor level. A higher order of segmentation though is the platform strategy, right. So Centrino, as we are now going into our fourth generation of Centrino with Santa Rosa platform is of course about the microprocessor but also about other technologies coming into. We were refreshing other technologies at least at the rate of the microprocessor refresh. So this one has NAND technology on the motherboard for faster boot, faster application loading. It’s got a new version of the WiFi chip; it’s got a new graphics engine in it for Crestline and so forth. Similarly, on the desktop the vPro technology has been doing quite well in terms of driving higher end sell up kinds of metrics in the enterprise that we think will now also manifest themselves in the mobile marketplace. 
Michael Masdea - Credit Suisse
Okay, I guess this follows on which is really what I am getting at is if you are able to sustain this differentiation which looks like you believe you can do this, this should be a business where everybody saw a 50% to 60% gross margin and we are obviously at the lower end of the range of that. Is there anything structurally changed compared to what we saw in this industry has in the past in your opinion or do you think that we actually have seen some change in that and we need to think about a different dynamic? 
 Paul Otellini
So I think we are ready to make long term gross margin forecast here. We do believe the key to having increasing improving healthy returns is to have the best products, that clearly and occasionally which means the cadence Paul talked about we won’t go back, we’ll wisely continue to drive the technology in both the architecture and the manufacturing side. 
Michael Masdea - Credit Suisse
That was very helpful. Thank you. 
Operator
Thank you very much sir. Ladies and gentlemen your next question comes from the line of Gurinder Kalra of Bear Stearns please proceed. 
Gurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns
Thanks. I guess in terms of your upside for the second half for margins, what are your assumptions/thoughts on Barcelona and its competitive impact and in some of our new products AMD might launch on desktops and notebooks? 
Paul Otellini
Well we have yet to see a demo of Barcelona so it’s hard to understand the metrics here. But everything we've seen or if we take the early indications or early commentary at face-value. I believe that we’ll be able to maintain our competitive lead in servers and in high-end desktops in the face of the introduction of that product line. And even though it isn't more competitive product line then they are shipping today, I think it still going to get down to the ramp and you'll have to ask AMD about their plans to ramp the product. 
Gurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns
Certainly, now you’re having outlook for margins for the second half you’re assuming that the traction you are getting right now it just continues to widen despite AMD's product introductions. 
Paul Otellini
I am assuming that we will be able to maintain our competitive lead in all segments all year. 
Gurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns
Okay. Nice, thanks very much. 
Operator
Thank you very much sir. Ladies and gentlemen your next comes from the line of Ross Seymore, Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. 
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Thanks. Paul earlier you mentioned that the channel side of the business was kind of better than seasonal in the first quarter. What do you think is going on in the Channel side versus the OEM sides? I guess that would also imply given your overall business for seasonally a little weaker that the OEM side was weaker than you may have expected? 
Paul Otellini
The Channel is obviously not terribly strong in selling notebooks the light book business is not a large chunk of the market today, where the Channel excels is in selling very good value in terms of technology for the bang for the buck. They were early to grab Woodcrest and Clovertown, which is our dual and quad-core servers and the White Box server business has been doing quite well particularly in North America and we see them as I said earlier ramping Conroe on the desktop. In some cases a little bit faster than some of the OEM's which gives them an advantage in the marketplace because of their cost effectiveness. So the combination of those is that you've got a quick moving set of players in the channel that are capitalizing on technology and winning business at the local level. 
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
And is it that something that you, it doesn't sound like any of those metrics would change as you go into the second half of this year. Is that a fair assumption? 
Paul Otellini
The relative advantage over the large OEM's tends to mitigate overtime as the large ones ship their product line to have the same kind of profile. But, other than that you start to, the agility factor is still one that, that has been there historically. 
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Okay. You mentioned a little bit just now about Woodcrest, and Clovertown, again just overall when you said the ASPs are down in your server segment, if the mix is increasingly dominated by the Woodcrest, and the Clovertown's, why were the ASP’s be dropping? 
Paul Otellini
Why were they dropping from quarter-to-quarter? 
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Yes, if the mix improves I would assume by more Woodcrest, and more Clovertown. 
Paul Otellini
Because the MP's which are much higher price become less of a share of the server business. 
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Okay. Is that a simple thing? Okay. 
Paul Otellini
Yes. 
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
And then the final question was just on the R&D side of equation, I noticed that popping up of course the M&A is coming down, so the net changes is zero on the OpEx, but overall Andy, if you could go little bit into what’s happening on the R&D side please? 
Andy Bryant
Kind of, they changed from before, what happens is we continue to believe, we are a technology company. We believe that’s the light side of Intel. So, as we find ways we can save money in the non R&D spaces. Well, again like I said before rather than drive spending even lower, we would tend to reinvest in the R&D side and hold the 10/7 for the year. With a little luck, we can see this happening again in the future. 
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Great, thank you. 
Kevin Sellers
Bill, we are coming close to the bottom of the hour. We'll take two more questions please. 
Operator
Okay, sir. Your next question comes from the line David Wu of Global Crown Capital, please proceed? 
David Wu - Global Crown Capital
Yes, good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. On the system integrated business are these people very flighty in terms of adopting the latest hot technology and therefore if you gain market share in Q1 and these people when they presumably will in Q2 as well is there risk that, that these same people who are quick to adopt new technology might so called fight back to the other people for your competitor in the second half. And I was wondering whether the OEM business was a little weak in Q1 because you obviously gain a lot market share incrementally from AMD and I don't see it in, in the Digital enterprise base? 
Paul Otellini
Well, the systems integrators are typically -- relatively small companies. They live and die by the competitiveness of their product line. They have moved very rapidly to our products and as long as we can continue to give them, pay the best products and be the best support and critical to that support is our terms and condition, our ability, supply and volume. The parts they need, when they need them and not constrain them. I think that they'll continue to do business with Intel and I am pretty confident about that. 
In terms of the mix shift to OEM and versus channel it wasn't that big of a thing and wasn’t that big of swing and I'll go take you back to Andy's earlier comment on overall revenue, which is that, that the micro-processor business was about were we expected it to be. 
David Wu - Global Crown Capital
Well, you know your only competitor had a major short fall in the unit volume and find it should land in your court. So I think that if the system integrated business was unseasonably strong then to get to your original target, the OEM business must be unseasonably weak? 
Paul Otellini
The relative scale is a lot different, right. I mean our distribution business runs about 30% of our overall business. It's not like its 50-50. 
David Wu - Global Crown Capital
I see. Okay. Thank you. 
Operator
Thank you very much, sir. And gentlemen, your last question comes from the line of James Covello of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. 
James Covello - Goldman Sachs
Hey, thanks guys. Just a quick question on the NAND Flash business. Obviously, it's been difficult. We know what you guys are doing there with the Santa Rosa platform. But how do you think about the benefits from Santa Rosa versus some of the cash that's been spent out and the returns that you could generate in the business long-term, if the pricing stays kind of depressed here? 
Paul Otellini
Well, we are still in the investment stage of this business as you indicate James. It's a lot of factors such as start-up costs as we ramp up new facilities and as we migrate to more dense products. The NAND pricing environment in the last six months, actually last three quarter has been particularly acute on the extreme aggressive side of the price curves. We have actually seen some firming up with NAND pricing in the last six weeks or so. And I am not going to give you a forecast, but there is some cause for optimism that has returned to more normal pricing curves. 
James Covello - Goldman Sachs
And is there a point at which, as you think about your expense that you had in the NOR business over the last few years, is there a point at which the pricing would reaccelerate to the downside that you guys might think about may be scaling back on the commitment a little bit, at least the level of commitment? 
Paul Otellini
No, we continue to look at that business plan. We look at it every quarter. We look at it every time when we make the capital commitment with our partner Micron, and the business continues to have the right kind of MPV model long-term for us to continue to invest in. 
James Covello - Goldman Sachs
Great, thanks so much. 
Kevin Sellers
Okay thanks, Jim. We are going to conclude the call now. I would like to ask Paul to give us a few closing comments as we do so. Paul? 
Paul Otellini
Thanks Kevin, and thank you all for your questions today. I wanted to leave you with a message that we have been highly focused on technology leadership and business efficiencies. We are seeing very good results in these areas. And I wanted to thank our employees for working hard and staying laser focused on these objectives. As you know, Intel's R&D pipeline extends many years into the future, and we have much to share with you on May 3rd, at our Analyst Meeting in New York. Thank you very much for your attendance today.

Thanks, Alex. In the fourth quarter, revenue was at the top of the range we set in October, driven by a strong mix shift to our new core microarchitecture in servers, mobile and the desktop. 
Microprocessor units came in about as expected and set an all-time record, with unit and revenue records in both server and mobile. 
For the year, Intel achieved record mobile and server processor units, FLASH units, and chipset billings. Our 65-nanometer transition was superbly executed, with more than 70 million units shipped during the year. 65-nanometer leadership allowed us to drive down the cost of dual-core computing, boosting dual-core volumes to over 50% of total Q4 microprocessor shipments. In mobile, we took dual-core from zero to over 90% of the performance mix in the course of one year. 
We continued to advance our technology in Q4 by launching the industry’s first quad-core processors for volume servers and PCs. We launched nine different versions, including the first Core 2 Quad processors for mainstream PCs, and we are well on track to deliver 1 million quad-core processors by the middle of next year. 
We also completed the development of our 45-nanometer technology, which is scheduled for production in the second-half of this year. I am pleased to announce that we have working samples of Penryn, our first 45-nanometer microprocessor, and have booted four different operating systems on this first silicon. 
In mobile, we saw record units and revenue on the strength of our product line. We look forward to launching our new Santa Rosa platform later in the first-half, which supports new integrated graphics, our Robson NAND Flash technology, and our 802.11n WiFi technology, which has already begun to ship. 
During the quarter, we demonstrated our first mobile WiMAX silicon and are developing products that work on both WiMAX and WiFi networks, automatically giving users the best available broadband connection. 
Desktop revenues were higher on the strength of Core 2 Dual, while overall units were below seasonal, as desktop growth continued to be offset by the demand shift to mobile. 
The digital home business had record units and revenue, driven by the ramp of our VIV technology. 
Our server business had record units, while strong demand for new products led to record revenue of over $1 billion. The energy-efficient Woodcrest processor exceeded 50% of total server units and Itanium revenues were at record levels. 
Our Clovertown quad-core processor extended the industry records set by Woodcrest, with energy performance 60% higher than Woodcrest and up to two-and-a-half times the competition’s best. 
Chipset units were approximately flat from the third quarter, and billings set a record for the year. Our Flash business set a new unit record, with growth in NOR as well as in our new NAND business. We also began volume shipments of the first 65-nanometer NOR memories that can store a gigabit of data on every chip. 
During the quarter, we continued to take significant actions to increase our operating efficiency and reduce ongoing costs. Our employee headcount ended the year at 94,100 people, down from 102,500 at mid-year. Our spending is trending lower, as Andy will discuss, and our capital forecasts now reflect savings identified in our structure and efficiency review. 
In summary, 2006 was a challenging year and our response was to drive for product and technology leadership aligned with the fastest growing segments of the marketplace. We were pleased to end the year with strong market acceptance of our advanced technologies, including the new Core 2 Dual and Xeon processors. 
In 2007, we will continue to drive technology, including quad-core and 45-nanometer, while further increasing our operating efficiencies across the company. 
Let me now turn the call over to Andy. 
Andy Bryant
Thanks, Paul. The fourth quarter was a strong ending to a difficult year. Revenue was higher than the third quarter in all geographies, led by revenue for server, mobile and desktop processors, which together were up 14% sequentially. For the second quarter in a row, the server business delivered double-digit sequential and year-to-year growth. 
Gains from a divestiture, less asset impairment charges caused by this divestiture, contributed a net gain of about $0.025 to earnings per share. Diluted shares for the year were down 5% from the prior year. Headcount is lower by nearly 6% for the quarter and the year. 
As we look ahead to 2007, we are on target to generate savings in costs and operating expenses of approximately $2 billion. 
Revenue for the fourth quarter was $9.7 billion, at the top of the range we forecast in October, and up 11% from the third quarter. The growth came from higher average selling prices and unit volumes of microprocessors and from higher revenue from Flash memory. 
As was the case in the third quarter, the server business led the percentage growth in revenue with higher units and higher average selling prices. The mobility group led the dollar growth, with higher revenue for microprocessors, wireless and chipsets. 
Microprocessor revenue in the digital enterprise group of $3.9 billion grew 9%, its strongest sequential growth rate in eight quarters. The mobility group achieved growth in microprocessors of 19%, its best sequential growth in over eight quarters. 
Revenue from chipsets, motherboards, and other products in the digital enterprise group was $1.3 billion, down 8% from the third quarter, while revenue for chipsets and other products in the mobility group was $925 million, up 14%. 
In a year-to-year comparison, quarterly revenue was down approximately 5%. Lower revenue in digital enterprise group more than offset growth in the mobility group. Among the geographies, the only year-to-year revenue growth came from the Americas region. 
Gross margin dollars, including the effect of share-based compensation of $94 million, were $4.8 billion, 12% higher than in the third quarter. Gross margin percentage was in line with our forecast and approximately flat with the third quarter. The percentage was 49.6% on a GAAP basis and 50.6% excluding share-based compensation. 
Under-load charges on the 90-nanometer network and the factories lowered gross margin from the third quarter by about two points. Write-downs and other gross margin reductions in the Flash memory business took nearly an additional point. These charges and Flash results offset much of the contribution to gross profit provided by higher average selling prices and unit volumes for microprocessors. 
In a year-to-year comparison, gross margin percentage, excluding share-based compensation, is approximately 11 points lower than the fourth quarter of 2005, primarily a result of lower average selling prices for microprocessors. 
We continue to bring spending down as a percentage of revenue during the quarter, and we significantly lowered headcount. R&D and MG&A were approximately $2.9 billion. Excluding share-based compensation of $240 million, spending was approximately $2.6 billion, a little higher than in the third quarter and just above our forecast in October. 
Compared to a year ago, spending excluding the impact of share-based compensation decreased approximately 12%. As Paul mentioned, the number of employees is down nearly 6,000 to 94,000. 
During the quarter, we completed the sale of certain assets of the company’s communications and application processor business. The financial impact of this transaction are reflected in two categories of the income statement. A gain of $483 million is included in interest and other income. With the sale of this business, we plan to deconstruct facilities and to sell a factory, resulting in charges for asset impairments of $317 million that are included in restructuring and asset impairment charges. 
Total restructuring charges and asset impairments were $457 million, consisting of the impairments related to the divestiture in employee severance charges from the efficiency program. 
Fully diluted earnings per share were $0.26. Excluding share-based compensation, earnings per share is $0.30. The gain from the divestiture plus the related impairments resulted in a net gain in earnings per share of approximately $0.025. 
On the balance sheet, inventory declined during the quarter by $163 million, or 4%, to $4.3 billion. Work in process and finished goods are lower than the third quarter, driven primarily by reduced wafer starts to control inventories. 
Total cash investments, comprised of cash, short-term investments, and fixed income trading assets, ended the quarter at $9.6 billion, an increase of $1.8 billion from the third quarter. Most of the increase came from cash flow from operations and proceeds from divestitures. 
Capital spending was $1.1 billion, stock repurchases were $150 million, and dividend payments were nearly $600 million. 
As we now turn to the outlook for the first quarter, please keep in mind that unless otherwise specified, the forecasts do not include the effect of any new acquisitions, divestitures, or similar transactions that may be completed after January 15th. I will use the midpoint of forecast ranges when making comparisons to specific periods. 
We are planning for revenue, which is typically lower in the first quarter, to be between $8.7 billion and $9.3 billion, a decrease of approximately 7%. 
Our expectation for gross margin percentage, including the effects of share-based compensation in the first quarter, is 49%, plus or minus a couple of points. This is nearly a point lower than the fourth quarter. Lower revenue than the fourth quarter will lower gross margin. Start-up costs related to the 45-nanometer process will reduce gross margin percentage by just under three additional points from the fourth quarter. 
Fewer write-downs versus the fourth quarter and lower unit cost of microprocessors will partially offset the margin declines listed above. 
Spending, R&D plus MG&A, including share-based compensation, should be approximately $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion, down approximately 7% from the fourth quarter, due primarily to lower operating and marketing expenses. In addition, in a separate category for restructuring and asset impairments, we expect expenses of approximately $50 million, down from $457 million in the fourth quarter. 
We are on track with the previously announced plan to reduce headcount to approximately 92,000 by mid-year, which will be 10,500, or 10% lower than the middle of 2006. 
Looking ahead to the full-year, we are planning for gross margin percentage of approximately 50% plus or minus a few points, including share-based compensation. We expect start-up costs to amount to about two points worth of gross margin compared to 2006 and under-load charges beyond the first quarter to be minimal. 
Cost-saving actions in 2006 will be reflected in significantly lower spending in 2007. The forecast for research and development is approximately $5.4 billion, almost $500 million lower than 2006. Total spending, including R&D and MG&A, but not restructuring charges, is forecasted to be $10.7 billion, down 11% or $1.3 billion from 2006. 
Efficiency efforts will also lower capital spending, which is targeted at $5.5 billion, plus or minus $200 million. 
In summary, outstanding new products, leadership in manufacturing technology, comprehensive cost savings, and disciplined execution have delivered a solid second-half and built a strong foundation for 2007. Business remains competitive and we remain focused on doing the right things in the year ahead -- delivering compelling products, competing for sales, attacking costs, executing superbly with 45-nanometers, and pushing ahead with the next generation. 
With that, let me turn it over to Alex for Q&A. 
Alex Lenke
Thanks, Andy. We will now open the conference call for Q&A. We will attempt to take questions from as many participants as possible. To help in this process, we ask that you please limit yourself to only one question and no more than one brief follow-up. Thank you. Operator, go ahead.

Your first question comes from the line of Glen Yeung with Citigroup. Please proceed. 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
Thanks for letting me ask a question here. I guess I have two questions, both of them are focused on gross margin, so Andy, maybe best for you. Looking at your ’07 guidance of 50%, really not a lot of improvement, even off of the fourth quarter number that you just printed. I wonder if you could talk to us as you have in the past about -- and you mentioned start-up costs, but what start-up costs are expected to be, what unit costs are expected to do, and what you think ASPs will do in ’07? 
Andy Bryant
I will almost answer all those. On start-up costs, first, a little tutorial. In the Intel business, you always have some level of start-up costs. We always have a new process or a new factory or a process changing from a factory, so in general, you would expect us in a year to have about two points of margin dedicated to start-up costs. In 2007, we will have approximately four points of margin deterioration because of start-up costs, because of the start-up for the 45-nanometer process. So that is step one. 
The other thing I would tell you, even though it was not asked, 70% approximately of those start-up costs will be in the first-half of the year, so it is a front-end loaded cost. 
Now, in terms of unit costs, we are seeing lower unit cost of microprocessors in the first quarter. That is one of the things that keeps margin actually a little higher than you would expect with this revenue drop. I expect to see unit costs continue down through the year, so I think I will have a very good progress through 2007 on unit costs of microprocessors. 
The one I can’t give you is we will not do an ASP forecast today. What I would tell you is we do anticipate a continued competitive business environment. 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
Okay, and part of your answer segues into the second question, which is the pattern of gross margins in ’07, particularly given your statements about where we will see the start-up costs over the course of the year. It sounds like it is relatively safe to assume that it is low in the first-half, much stronger in the second-half, and is it fair to say that start-up costs kind of revert back to normal in ’08? 
Andy Bryant
Yes, but let me be careful. If you talk about start-up costs, it is high in the first-half, lower in the second-half. 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
Right, I’m sorry, gross margins is what I am referring to. 
Andy Bryant
Okay, gross margin then flips on that, so I wanted to make sure we go that one. At this point, I would expect ’08 to revert to normal, yes. 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
Okay, great, thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Tim Luke with Lehman Brothers. Please proceed. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers
Thank you. Andy, just as a follow-up to that, as you plan your 50% gross margin guidance for the full year, and given your commentary on the first-half impact of the start-up costs, should we logically see some sequential progression through each quarter of the year, or with seasonal decline in revenue, would it be sort of flattish or lower in the second quarter? 
Andy Bryant
I really do not want to make a second quarter forecast yet. What we did say is in the first quarter, you should see just under three points margin deterioration from the fourth quarter for start-up costs. We said the full year has a two point effect, approximately 70% of the full year is in the first-half, and other than that, I really do not want to do much more talking about the second quarter. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers
As a follow-up, I might then ask, you referred to your expenses being somewhat above your forecast. Could you give some clarification there, and on the assumptions for the $2 billion in cost-cutting? Thank you. 
Andy Bryant
Sure. The expenses were a bit above the range I gave at the beginning of the quarter. There were three reasons for that. One is with higher revenue, we had slightly higher Intel Inside accrual expenses. Two, with higher profits than we anticipated, we had a little bit higher profit dependent expenses, and then the third effect is even though I am 1,000 heads lower than I expected to be, the rate at which they left the company was later in the quarter, so I had a little bit more expense because of that. 
What was the second? 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers
$2 billion. 
Andy Bryant
On the $2 billion, you can actually see it if you do a year over year on the spending, you see it down $1.3 billion. The tougher part to see is in manufacturing. You will have to take my word for it. We actually could show you some of the programs at the analysts meeting, give you a sense for the very specific programs that lead to easily $0.5 billion. I could give you some more detail there on the savings that we expect to see out of the capital budget as well. 
I am pretty comfortable. I have seen $2 billion and it will surprise me if I didn’t get a little bit more.

Your next question comes from the line of Sumit Dhanda with Banc of America Securities. Please proceed. 
Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Securities
Hi, Andy, I guess this question is for you again. I just want to be clear on the start-up cost impact. Are you suggesting the gross impact is four points, which equates to something close to $1.5 billion in start-up costs? Is that all just 45-nanometer related, or does that include start-up costs from [inaudible], and if so, what is the breakout? 
Andy Bryant
So you’re thinking of the full year? 
Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Securities
Yes. 
Andy Bryant
So in the general running of Intel's business, there are about two points of gross margin, two percentage points. I am letting you pick your revenue number, so you multiply that by two percentage points and you get the baseline. There will be an additional two points of margin deterioration in 2007 due to the high cost of the 45-nanometer start-up, so yes, take whatever your revenue is, 4% is equal to -- actually, not whatever yours is but whatever ours is, and it will be close enough. We will not be that far off. 4% of that cost is the total start-up cost for the company, approximately, in 2007. 
Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Securities
But the incremental deterioration is only two points versus 2006, correct? 
Andy Bryant
That is absolutely correct. It is an incremental two points, of which you start to see that in the first quarter. The first quarter itself has, as I said, just under three points increased deterioration to margin due to start-up costs. The first-half of the year has 70% of those costs. 
Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Securities
I guess as a follow-up to this, what I am unclear on is as you think about the cost side of the equation, clearly the start-up costs are a bit of a headwind, and you do have slightly higher depreciation, but I would have anticipated more of a benefit from lower labor costs due to the reduction in manufacturing, headcount, and then on the materials line, at least as a percentage of costs trending down, given better unit costs. 
I am just trying to figure out why this does not equate to better gross margins, despite the start-up cost headwind that you have. 
Andy Bryant
Again, we could each have different models. We do believe it is still going to be a competitive business environment and we are going to have to fight to win orders. 
Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Securities
Okay, let me just ask a final question. If you were to think about where there is the biggest delta to your gross margin forecast, what line item would that be? 
Andy Bryant
The biggest risk to my forecast, is that the question? 
Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Securities
Risk, positive or negative. 
Andy Bryant
So the start-up costs are pretty predictable, so I will not bring that as a positive or a negative. As is always the case, price has the biggest effect because it starts with a bigger number. Cost of unit, how full the factories are probably the second biggest variable. 
Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Securities
So what kind of a price decline have you built into your forecasting? This is my last question. 
Andy Bryant
At least you are saving the one for last you knew that I would duck. We are trying not to make a full-year revenue forecast. We are trying not to make an ASP forecast this year.

Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Osha with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed. 
Joseph Osha - Merrill Lynch
Hi there. Two questions. First, are you able to say whether you expect inventories to be down in the first quarter or not? What is your thought there? 
Andy Bryant
What I would expect, Joe, with revenue being down some, if we can kind of stay flat, I would be pretty satisfied with that result. That would be a goal. 
Joseph Osha - Merrill Lynch
So flat, do you think? 
Andy Bryant
That is the goal. It is tough to hold it in a declining revenue environment, but I think we have a shot at it. 
Joseph Osha - Merrill Lynch
Secondly, on the start-up costs issue, I just for the heck of it while you have been talking here, I went back and found your comments from the fourth quarter of ’05, and you talked about start-up costs for 65-nanometer being an issue. I guess I am just wondering whether we are in an environment now where you are going to have to deliver process innovations at an increasing rate in order to compete, and whether we should necessarily think about there being a point at which this kind of start-up cost treadmill ends. 
Andy Bryant
I do not think so, Joe. We are pretty consistent on our two-year treadmill that we have been on for years and years and years. We think we stay on it. We do not accelerate it. We also think we do not drift back from it. So I do think that leaves us with every two years, a new generation of start-up spike. 
We did look back at ’05 to see if it is in the same magnitude. Quite frankly, it is similar to the magnitude we are seeing for ’07. I had hoped it would be a little less because we are ramping three factories instead of four. The difference is the equipment is a little more expensive, so the costs per factory is up a little bit. It turns out to be about the same dollars. 
Joseph Osha - Merrill Lynch
So you think you can jump off of this treadmill in ’08, at least briefly? 
Andy Bryant
Well, we did in ’06, so yes, if you look at ’06, it was what I would call the standard load. If you look at ’08, I see no reason that we can’t get back to the standard load. 
Joseph Osha - Merrill Lynch

Thanks. Paul, a question on Vista. There is a lot of anticipation about this operating system. What is your observation regarding the launch and how it has impacted Q4 and perhaps the first-half of the calendar year? Thanks. 
Paul Otellini
Well, we are optimistic about the launch and the prospects for Vista, particularly in the consumer markets. I think it is going to be instant adoption for new machines right out of the chute, and that is particularly important when you think about the fourth quarter, where the action was. The action in the fourth quarter was in consumer notebooks and they sold at record numbers despite the spectre of a Vista launch in January. 
I am optimistic that Vista will help us across the board in consumer sales, including the hottest part of the market, which is notebooks right now. 
Hans Mosesmann - Nollenberger Capital
Has it changed the linearity at all for Q1, based on historicals?

Your next question comes from the line of John Lau with Jefferies & Company. Please proceed. 
John Lau - Jefferies & Company
Great, thank you. I wanted to circle back to the server area. You had mentioned that you had record units and ASPs for your server unit. Given the competition has indicated that they are much lower, it would imply that you have gained a significant amount of market share going forward. 
The gross margin is a little bit lower. You are guiding down almost a percentage lower than you did last quarter. Do we take that to assume that you will continue to be very price sensitive and competitive in that marketplace to continue gaining market share? Thank you. 
Paul Otellini
Maybe I will answer the first part of the question, and Andy can speak again to the gross margin, but we do not give and we are not going to give a gross margin by product segment, at least in terms of forecast. 
You are right. We did have record units in servers. It was not a record ASP. It was a sequentially increased ASP, and we are very comfortable with that. That reflects rapid adoption of Woodcrest and some of the quad-core products. 
In terms of market segment share, I think it is a little premature to answer that question, but we are optimistic that our surge in Q4 in servers will reflect our market share as the numbers are calculated. 
John Lau - Jefferies & Company
Going forward, are you, with the gross margin overall, I am not asking about the specific server area, but if you are guiding gross margins to be lower about a percentage point, some of that is start-up costs, of course, but are you going to maintain that competitive pressure to gain back the market share that you may have lost in 2006? Is that part of your goal? 
Paul Otellini
I continue to believe that our shareholders are best served by Intel using its capacity to retake market share that we lost this year. Nothing has changed there, except that we perhaps now have a much better product portfolio to do that with. The flexibility and the breadth of that product portfolio gives us a number of pricing options. 
John Lau - Jefferies & Company
Great, thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of David Wong with A.G. Edwards. Please proceed. 
David Wong - A.G. Edwards & Sons, Inc.
Thank you very much. Could you give us an indication of your gross margin guidance, how much of that is impacted by NAND start-up costs and any other assumptions associated with NAND? Are you assuming any NAND write-downs in 2007? 
Andy Bryant
I do not know that I am assuming any NAND write-downs in 2007. The product is just launching and getting started. There are start-up costs in the routine part of the business associated with NAND. 
One of the things that happened from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, the reason margin did not rise as much as we would have expected with that kind of revenue growth is we did have additional NAND start-up costs and we did have some write-downs of some flash inventory. 
There is nothing baked in that is remarkably different. It is a ramping business. It is a new business. New factories are being brought to bear and as those come online, you will see start-up costs for those as well. 
David Wong - A.G. Edwards & Sons, Inc.
One further one, if I might. Could further divestitures change either revenue or your gross margin or op-ex guidance for 2007, or have you pretty much done all the things that might have a big impact on 2007 income statements? 
Andy Bryant
Well, certainly everything we have done is reflected in the outlook we provide you and I cannot comment on anything that is being considered.

Your next question comes from the line of Cody Acree with Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed. 
Cody Acree - Stifel Nicolaus
Thanks. Andy, could you talk about where you stand on the crossover for the new microarchitecture? 
Andy Bryant
As far as production? 
Cody Acree - Stifel Nicolaus
Yes. 
Andy Bryant
It is essentially done. If I look at the inventories I have in the processor space, it is almost completely transitioned. So essentially think of processors on the new 65-nanometer silicon chipsets rapidly getting to be 100% of the 90-nanometer. 
Cody Acree - Stifel Nicolaus
So what variable or I guess what incremental impact do you have as you go into the next couple of quarters of utilization rates and yields and manufacturing? If we are already all the way over to the new microarchitecture, how much of an impact can that have outside of just these fluctuations in the start-up costs? 
Andy Bryant
Well, you know, we show you the traditional quarterly cost per unit chart at the analyst meeting. I think what you will see is a pretty solid progress throughout 2007 on that. The same thing will happen in the chipset spaces. We are bringing Crestline into the 90-nanometer 12-inch factories. You will start to see some benefit there. 
If demand went up and the factories were more loaded, you would see some benefit there. Quite frankly, if demand softens, you would see more under-load charges. 
Paul Otellini
There is one other factor, which I think is the mix of quad versus dual versus single core processors over the course of the year. Our roadmap would have us continuing to ramp the quad-core, which effectively utilizes more capacity than the dual-core, and the dual-core will continue to move down in our price stack over the course of the year, which effectively gives us more capacity in the single-core. We think that is a very cost-effective and competitive move, given the 65-nanometer die sizes. 
Cody Acree - Stifel Nicolaus
So you mentioned, Andy, the internal inventories into Q1, the target is to try to keep them about flat, regardless of the revenue trends. Are you comfortable then at that inventory level? Or as we move on into a revenue growth period, are you hopeful that you can work those down any further? 
Andy Bryant
I hate to make an inventory forecast out through the year. I would guess it would still come down a little bit, to be honest. I am in a situation now, we said we took about two points of under-load charges in the fourth quarter, which was more than we expected as the quarter began. We did cut back wafer starts in the 90-nanometer factories. I have under-load charges in the first quarter as well, again in the 90-nanometer factories. 
From that point through the rest of the year, I think I am in pretty good shape, so yes, I would like to manage my inventories not to grow. I would like to manage them to be down some. If revenues are up seasonally in the second quarter, it makes it a little bit tough, but that would be a good goal, and then to get some benefits in the back-half of the year. 
Cody Acree - Stifel Nicolaus
All right, and lastly, do you want to take a shot at where you stood with market share here at the end of the year? 
Andy Bryant
Not really. We have frequently speculated before we have seen final numbers and it is a guessing game. We would just as soon wait and see what actually gets published from the people who have the numbers. 
Cody Acree - Stifel Nicolaus
Any places you feel you definitely gained share? 
Andy Bryant
Again, the speculation game has not worked very well, so I think we will just wait and see what gets published.

Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs
Good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much. Andy, could you update us on the plans through the strategy with the NOR flash business at this point going forward? 
Andy Bryant
The plans with the NOR strategy with Flash is Paul and I keep reminding them we expect to see quarterly improvements in pre-tax. I would say we made some last year, we kind of flipped back a little in the fourth quarter, which was disappointing to us, but there is no question the team is dedicated to turn that thing around and we are driving as hard as we can. 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs
What do you think will ultimately drive the go or no-go decision there? 
Andy Bryant
Well, right now, there is only a go decision, and the go says make money and if you don’t make money, we have to figure out whether we have to resize the business or whether there is some way to restructure it to make it make more sense for us. 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs
You think that at some point during ’07, you would have to make that decision if the results did not turn around? 
Andy Bryant
I guess I could say yes to that, but I would rather say I think Brian and the team are going to turn the results around. That is the goal. 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs
Got it. If I could just ask a quick question on the follow-up on the cap-ex. Obviously a lot of the cap-ex spending is for 45-nanometer. Any breakdown between equipment percentages in ’06 and ’07 versus just non-equipment? 
Andy Bryant
I will give you that later, but the equipment percentage is higher than normal. What you will see when we show it in the analyst meeting is it is one of the higher percentages we have had towards advanced 45-nanometer type equipment than we have seen in a long, long time. We have savings across almost every other bucket. We saved, as headcount came down, I can save on office construction, as the efficiency program really targeted heavily. In similar terms, I can save on some of the equipment we buy back there. 
So what you are seeing is, will see is a higher percentage in equipment than we have historically had, and historically we have said it is about a third fab equipment. 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs
Right, terrific. Thanks so much.

Your next question comes from the line of Adam Parker with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed. 
Adam Parker - Sanford Bernstein
Hi. Do you guys think you under-shipped consumption in the fourth quarter? I know you talked about having some channel inventory you needed to burn down. Did you accomplish what you needed there in Q4? I guess just more macro, do you think given the overall demand environment, economically speaking, that that supports having the best MPU quarter in the last eight or more quarters? 
Andy Bryant
This is a two-sided question. We talked -- you should talk to our customers and see what they think about their inventories. All information we have says their inventories are under control and it is a null issue. If you look at our channel inventory, it is normal. It is dead flat with the third quarter, and about where we expected it to be. 
What we really are concerned about is that there may be somebody else’s parts in the channel that could cause it to slow down a little bit in the first part of the first quarter. 
Adam Parker - Sanford Bernstein
So okay, and then just economically, you are comfortable that you did not over-ship at all? 
Andy Bryant
We do not think we did at all. We do not think we over-shipped at all. 
Adam Parker - Sanford Bernstein
Okay, the only other question I have would be about pricing for processors. Could you talk at all about how you would characterize the pricing environment now, maybe versus a few months ago? Was it more competitive into the second quarter of ’06 than it was in the second quarter of ’04? Maybe a little bit on desktop versus notebook in that regard. 
Paul Otellini
It remains competitive, Adam, but you have to remember over the course of this year, we probably have the biggest single series of price moves we have ever had, and that had to do with us resetting our entire price stack in servers, desktop, and notebooks for the introduction of the new products for all three lines which came in essentially over the course of the summer. We have never had that broad base of new products hit us all at once. 
As you bring the new products in, you drop the prices on the old products and price the new ones just to hit the sweet spots of the volume, so the effective thrash in pricing was really much more a function of new product technologies coming in than anything else. 
From a competitive perspective, I think that -- 
Adam Parker - Sanford Bernstein
But you have had new products in the past and not taken the same cut. 
Paul Otellini
Not across the board. Not in all three segments at once. It is the first time we have introduced top to bottom. 
Adam Parker - Sanford Bernstein
So that implies a much more benign environment going forward then. 
Paul Otellini
Well, there were 40 new products this year. I said part of this was a competitive environment and I do not think that is changing. Part of it was also the magnitude of bringing 40 new products out. 
Adam Parker - Sanford Bernstein
Any desktop versus notebook distinction there, or no? 
Paul Otellini
It was much more acute and more competitive in desktop. 
Adam Parker - Sanford Bernstein
And that is your forecast going forward as well, or you do not want to give that? 
Paul Otellini
We are not doing a forecast. 
Adam Parker - Sanford Bernstein
But I mean, the reason people keep asking is because the single most important variable for your company is pricing for processors, so that is why we think about it. 
Paul Otellini
We recognize that.

Chris Danely - J.P. Morgan
Thanks, guys, nice job on the share gains. With the $5.5 billion in cap-ex, could you just give us a sense of how much you expect your unit output to increase? 
Andy Bryant
I will duck that one. What I will tell you is when asked that question, we are kind of directing people to look at the market forecasters to see what they think overall units will do. Most of them are saying 8% to 10%, and then the question becomes can we take some share or not. But it gives you a ballpark for what we are thinking of. 
Chris Danely - J.P. Morgan
On the inventory, in the past it has trended between sort of 60 to 70 days, and it looks like we are going to set the bottom here around 75 to 80 days, and it was up to 100 days. Do you feel comfortable with this 80 to 100 day new range of inventory, or do we expect to look at a different range next year? 
Andy Bryant
As always, I like it to be a little bit lower. We have to be careful. In the past, I have gotten it too low and we have been burned by it, so like I said, my goal would be to kind of hold it flat to a down revenue period, a seasonally down revenue period, and then hopefully as revenue kicks up, I can have inventory come down a little bit. 
Chris Danely - J.P. Morgan
I guess the gist of my question is with this inventory range, do you think your gross margins can get back to the low 60% range?

Mark Edelstone - Morgan Stanley
Okay, great, and then a question for you, Paul. Santa Rosa obviously is coming in the second quarter, but I think you have had a one-month delay here as of late. Could you just talk about the factors that caused that push-out? 
Paul Otellini
We have not delayed the product. It is on the same schedule it had from the day we set it, which is we have always planned to launch it in the first-half. It is in the second-half of the first-half, and we have never given a specific month, but there is no delay on it, Mark. 
Mark Edelstone - Morgan Stanley
Okay, so basically it is a May launch now, is that correct? 
Paul Otellini
I did not give a date. I am just saying there is no delay. 
Mark Edelstone - Morgan Stanley
Okay, fair enough. I guess from both a marketing perspective as well as from a technical perspective, everything is on track to basically get that launch date?

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Masdea with Credit Suisse. 
Michael Masdea - Credit Suisse
Thanks a lot. Just kind of a high-level question. You talked, I think you said record a record number of times in your opening preamble, so clearly you are getting some momentum in a lot of areas, but your EPS here is about, if I look at it on a comparable basis, about 25% of the peak that you saw in December of ’05. What closes that gap beyond what you have already talked about on the cost side? How can you really get there, or have we really seen at least a near-term peak in what you guys can earn, given the market? 
Andy Bryant
Again, now we are looking to start making long-term EPS forecasts. I cannot do that. We know that we are down versus a year ago for two reasons. One, revenue is down. Margins are down about 11 points, I said, and that is almost all ASP. We know it has been a very tough pricing year. Hopefully we have laid the foundation with, as Paul said, the 40 new products. We have 45-nanometer coming out later this year. We have another set of new products coming out later this year. We feel pretty good about the position we put ourselves in and we think it is our job to execute and the business will come out the way the business will come out. 
Michael Masdea - Credit Suisse
Okay, maybe another piece of that. You talked about moving more to quad-core and dual-core and that will take up more of the capacity, et cetera. Silicon size obviously is inherently going up in what you are saying there. Do you feel confident that the ASP side will offset that and mitigate that? In other words, you can get higher prices for the multi-core, or does the strategy remain to offer it at the high-end of what the prior generation was? 
Paul Otellini
We brought the quad-core in the same price range as our prior dual-core extremes. We brought the quad-core mainstream products in at the same price as our prior dual-core high-end products, so that model will continue. 
We will give you an update on the overall product costs at the analyst meeting, but we remain very comfortable that the product costs will continue to come down over the course of the year, average product costs. 
Michael Masdea - Credit Suisse
In line at least with the overall ASP increase -- I mean, the silicon size increase, at least? 
Paul Otellini
It gets back to the mix and the average, which we really are not going to go at.

Charlie Glavin - Needham & Company
Thanks. Paul, going back to a comment that you made right at the end of your opening remarks about capital forecast now being in line post your savings and efficiency review, could you give a little more clarity? Given the divestitures that you have done, has there been a change to the prior 8-K statement about $1 billion in deferred cap-ex for ’08? 
Andy Bryant
So what you are asking is are we still on track to save $1 billion from the ’08 forecast we never gave you, right? 
Charlie Glavin - Needham & Company
Right. 
Andy Bryant
Boy, that’s an easy one. The answer is we have seen capital savings out of this program earlier than we anticipated, but it does not mean we said it is pulled in. Our expectation is to go and find $1 billion in addition in ’08. So whatever savings I get before then, we are going to take to the bank and then we are going to go and see if we can still get another $1 billion. 
We have been pleasantly surprised that as you start to accumulate savings in this program, more seems to start to appear. We are pretty comfortable that we will continue to derive capital efficiency as well as other types of efficiency in the company. 
Charlie Glavin - Needham & Company
Andy or Paul, is there any disconnect between the motherboard unit shipments being down, chipsets being relatively flat, but the higher end microprocessors being up in terms of either market share, rebalancing of shortages that occurred coming out of the summer? If you could give a little more clarity. Thanks. 
Paul Otellini
I think there are a couple of things. I think that there was potentially a little bit of chipset double-ordering after the announced acquisition of ATI. That sort of created a bit of an earlier surge than probably would have ordinarily happened for the fourth quarter, which always leads the PC sales. That combined with the fact that we are now seeing people were buying in December for January, February sales, and that is seasonally down from the fourth quarter. So it is really a bit of both things to hit the chipset business that cause it to be flat.

I think that it is going to be, the trends we are likely to see, that we are banking on, are Vista helping consumer sales, particularly in notebooks, and the secular trend where the overall growth in the Internet is driving more servers because there is more data to be stored. Those two trends are not going to go away. 
The question that we do not know yet is whether the combination of Vista plus the vPro product line out of Intel will create a change in the refresh rate of enterprise-based PCs outside of notebooks. That is just a bit of an unknown at this point. 
Uche Orji - UBS
That is helpful. Just, if I look at 45-nanometer, could you just remind us how much you think will get in 2007, with the percentage of your total allowance for 45-nanometer space? 
Andy Bryant
Premature to give that since we have not really announced the ship date of the first product, so again, that is one of those things you would expect to get some kind of insight on at the analyst meeting. 
Uche Orji - UBS
Just one last question, back to NOR Flash. I know you said it slipped back in Q4 and you said you have not decided if you are still looking at a go decision at this point. If I look into 2007 for NOR Flash, could you just give us an idea as to how this business will trend? Should we expect it to kind of come back to the levels we have seen recently, of the break-even levels? What kind of trend are we seeing today, given all the issues in the handset sector? Could you just give us an idea how to think about this? 
Andy Bryant
In general, we do not make forecasts by sub-segments, but the NOR Flash business revenue was up nicely in the fourth quarter. Historically, it is seasonally down in the first quarter, as you would expect. We have dedicated a specific factory to that business, which we think should lead to an opportunity to have more market penetration. The key is we have to make sure we have the products in the marketplace and we have to go and win orders, just like we do in every other part of our business. 
There is a possibility for nice growth there. Again, it comes down to the fact that we just have to execute. Probably more than any time in recent history we feel like we are in a good position across the board and we have to go execute. 
Alex Lenke
Operator, two more questions, please. 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Prudential. Please proceed. 
Mark Lipacis - Prudential Equity Group
Thank you very much for taking the question. You mentioned higher ASPs. Hoping that you would be willing to perhaps quantify how much better the ASPs were this quarter, and also could you help us understand to what extent was the higher ASPs driven by just having a phenomenal quarter with your servers? Or within the individual segments, are customers now walking themselves back up the price stack and paying a higher ASP in desktop and a higher ASP in notebook, for example? Thanks. 
Paul Otellini
Well, there certainly was some improvement in mix to servers and notebooks in Q4 versus Q3, which gives you a better overall average. ASPs in server were up sequentially. ASPs in notebooks or mobile were up sequentially. ASPs in desktop were approximately flat. 
Mark Lipacis - Prudential Equity Group
Okay, thank you. That is real helpful. The other follow-up question, it seems like the dual-core is ramping, is penetrating quite rapidly. How should we expect the quad-core to ramp? Would you expect a similar pace of penetration of quad-core into the market as dual-core, or would you expect something a little bit slower? Thank you. 
Paul Otellini
I think in the performance intensive parts of the market, which are the gamers and the workstation parts of the market, and DP servers, quad-core will have a very strong penetration. It will not have a widespread consumer penetration until we get quad-core into the notebook, because that again is the fastest growing part of the market. It is still priced, while it has moved down nicely for the mainstream desktop, it is not down into the highest volume price points of the retail segment yet, and I do not really see it getting there over the course of at least the first-half of ’07. 
Mark Lipacis - Prudential Equity Group
Great, thank you very much. 
Operator
Your final question comes from the line of Gus Richard with First Albany Capital. Please proceed. 
Gus Richard - First Albany Capital
Thanks for taking my question. Could you just talk a little bit about cutting server just slightly differently, the Bensley platform. What percentage of revenue was that in the fourth quarter? What do you see it being in the first? 
Paul Otellini
I do not think we are in a position to give you that level of granularity, Gus. I’m sorry. 
Gus Richard - First Albany Capital
You had mentioned the shipments of Woodcrest in the fourth quarter. Could you just repeat that for me, please? 
Paul Otellini
I said that Woodcrest was over 50% of the DP servers in Q4, which is its second quarter of production. 
Gus Richard - First Albany Capital
Okay, and you expect that to continue to ramp going forward, I’m sure? 
Paul Otellini
Yes, it will displace -- it will be essentially our only DP product line, that and the quad-core versions of it, very soon. 
Gus Richard - First Albany Capital
Okay, and just to finish up -- 
Paul Otellini
The only thing that is retarding that is customer conversion rates. In servers, they tend to have a long tail on some of the conversions. 
Gus Richard - First Albany Capital
Right. That switch-over should finish up in what, the next two quarters? Is that reasonable? 
Paul Otellini
Sure. 
Gus Richard - First Albany Capital
Okay, appreciate it. Thank you.

Thanks, Alex. Q3 was a good quarter for Intel across many fronts. Sales were above the midpoint of our expectation in July. We delivered over 6 million processors based on the new Core micro architecture and had record shipments in our mobile and server product segments. Chipsets remained strong, on a solid note, and we gained market segment share. 
In the past 100 days, we have introduced a wide array of new products, refreshing our entire product line from notebook to desktop and from volume DP servers to Xeon, MP and Itanium. We are pleased the industry recognizes our clear leadership with the Core micro architecture. We're disclosing today that we have now shipped quad-core versions for revenue, as well. Intel's quad-core processors work in existing designs, boosting energy performance by up to 50% in DP servers and by about 70% in desktops and workstations. 
Our factories have been executing extremely well with over 40 million 65 nanometer processors now shipped and a crossover from 90 nanometer now achieved. Our 45 nanometer process development is on track for the second half of 2007 and we plan to tape out the first of 15 45-nanometer processors this quarter. 
Our R&D strategy is to introduce a new micro architecture every two years, a pace that we haven't seen in a long time, while shrinking the existing architectures in the intervening years for an unrivaled innovation stream. 
Moving to the digital enterprise, our server business generated higher revenue and record units driven by strong demand for new products in Xeon DP, MP and Itanium. We launched the vPro platform for business PCs and see strong design wins and ecosystem support. The Mobility group also had record units as mobile continues to take client PC share. We demonstrated our new Robeson technology, which places NAND flash on the motherboard for faster boots and resume, plus longer battery life. We introduced the industry's first WiMAX silicone for both fixed and mobile networks and see WiMAX as a potential catalyst for both Centrino and our ultra-mobile PC platforms. 
The desktop market segment remained very competitive. We are pleased with the market's acceptance of our moving the Pentium product into lower price points, as we ramp the new Core micro architecture. The Core 2 Duo is now widely recognized as the performance and energy efficiency leader and is moving into the mainstream, supported by our biggest ad campaign in years. 
At the spring analyst meeting, I announced a comprehensive review of the Company's operations with the goal of making Intel a more nimble and efficient competitor. During the quarter, we reached a number of important conclusions and also began to take significant actions to reduce our ongoing costs. 
Our headcount declined by over 2,600 during the quarter and we are on track to be at 95,000 employees by the end of the year and 92,000 by the middle of next year. We plan to reduce our costs by $2 billion in 2007 and by $3 billion in 2008. 
In summary, Intel is entering the strongest part of the year with technology and manufacturing leadership, ample leading edge capacity, and a portfolio of new products across our mobile desktop and server businesses. We plan to sustain our lead by being the first to 45-nanometer and delivering a new core or shrink every year. We will achieve these goals by becoming more agile and putting the right cost structure in place for our future growth. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Andy. 
Andy Bryant
Thanks, Paul. We made good progress in the third quarter towards our goal for a stronger second half. Revenue from microprocessors was up from the second quarter in all geographies and in the channel. The server business was an important bright spot with double-digit sequential and year-to-year growth. Our comprehensive effort to reduce costs is gaining traction, as is our work to restructure the business. 
Gains from divestitures and sales of investments contributed to earnings per share. Revenue for the third quarter was $8.7 billion, in the upper half of the range we forecast in July and up 9% from the second quarter. While consistent with patterns for this period, a portion of the sequential growth is a function of our lower revenue base in the second quarter when some of our customers reduced their inventories. 
The growth in the third quarter came from higher unit volumes of microprocessors, chipsets, motherboards and wireless networking products; offset somewhat by lower average selling prices for microprocessors. The server business led the percentage growth from the second quarter with higher units and higher average selling prices. Microprocessor revenue in the digital enterprise and mobility groups grew 9% to a total of $5.8 billion. 
Revenue from chipsets, motherboards and other products in these two groups was $2.2 billion, up 11%. Flash memory was lower than the second quarter due to lower unit volumes. As is usually the case in the third quarter, business was strongest in the greater European region where revenue was up 17%. In Europe, the Americas and Japan revenue growth was higher than seasonal averages, while in Asia Pacific the growth was slightly lower. 
In a year-to-year comparison, quarterly revenue was down approximately 12%. Most of the decrease came from the digital enterprise group. whose revenue was down approximately 22%. Revenue for the mobility group was up 3%. Among the geographies, nearly all of the year-to-year revenue decrease was in Asia Pacific and Europe. 
Gross margin dollars of $4.3 billion, including the effect of share-based compensation of $103 million, were 3% higher than in the second quarter. Gross margin percentage was 49.1% on a GAAP basis, in line with our forecasts. Without share-based compensation, gross margin percentage was 50.3%, 2.6 points lower than in the second quarter. Some erosion in average selling prices, higher unit costs for 90-nanometer dual-core microprocessors and reserves for mature products lowered the gross margin percentage; while higher unit volumes partially offset the decrease. In a year-to-year comparison, gross margin percentage, excluding share-based compensation is approximately 9.5 points lower for the third quarter of 2005, primarily a result of lower revenue. 
We exceeded our goals in reducing spending during the quarter as we lowered headcount and cut discretionary spending. Spending is also down sequentially as a percentage of revenue. R&D and MG&A were $2.8 billion lower than the forecast in July and down 9% from the second quarter. Excluding share-based compensation of $232 million, spending decreased approximately 8% from a year ago. The number of employees declined during the quarter to just below 100,000. In addition, restructuring charges for the quarter, consisting of severance and benefits for terminated employees, were $98 million. 
Net gains on equity securities and interest and other were $440 million, two times the $220 million forecast in July due to gains from divestitures and the sale of a portion of investments in Micron Technology. Fully diluted earnings per share were $0.22, including approximately $0.015 cents from the net impact of gains from divestitures and sale of investments and from restructuring charges. Excluding share-based compensation, earnings per share is $0.27. 
On the balance sheet, inventories of $4.5 billion were up $145 million for the second quarter. Inventories of chipsets and flash memory were higher and inventories of microprocessors were lower. Based on the midpoint of forecast for revenue and gross margin for the fourth quarter, inventories at the current level are less than one quarter's cost of sales, which is similar to our throughput time. We expect inventories to be slightly lower by the end of the fourth quarter. 
Total cash investments, comprised of cash, short-term investments, and fixed income trading assets, ended the quarter at $7.8 billion, up from $7.2 billion in the second quarter. Capital spending was $1.2 billion. Stock repurchases were $500 million and dividend payments were nearly $600 million. As a reminder, we indicated in April that we expected to reduce the level of our stock repurchases as we continue to manage our cash flow. 
As we turn now to the outlook for the fourth quarter, please keep in mind that unless otherwise specified, the forecasts do not include the effect of any new acquisitions, divestitures, or similar transactions that may be completed after October 16th. With the exception of the headcount forecast, the outlook does not include the effect of a previously announced planned sale of Intel's communications and applications processor business to Marvell Technology. I will use the midpoint of forecast ranges when making comparisons to specific periods. 
We are planning for revenue in the fourth quarter to be between $9.1 billion and $9.7 billion, an increase of approximately 8%, consistent with seasonal patterns. This forecast assumes higher revenue than the third quarter from microprocessors, chipsets and flash memory. 
Our expectation for gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter is 50%, plus or minus a couple of points. Without share-based compensation of approximately 1 point of margin, the forecast for gross margin percentage is 51%, plus or minus a couple of points. Higher volume and slightly lower unit costs from microprocessors will lift gross margin, but we expect this to be partially offset by charges on the 90-nanometer networks in the factories, as we transition production to 65-nanometer; and by start-up costs on the new 45-nanometer process technology. 
Spending, R&D plus MG&A, should be approximately $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion. The forecast includes about $250 million of share-based compensation. Without the impact of these charges, spending should be approximately $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion. Although revenue is forecast to be 8% higher than in the third quarter, we expect spending to be approximately flat or slightly lower as we proceed with cost reductions. 
In addition, we expect restructuring charges of approximately $125 million. We are on track with the previously announced plan to reduce headcount to approximately 95,000 by year end, including the effect of the planned sale of the communications and applications processor business. This would bring headcount down 5% from the end of 2005, with continuing reductions through 2007. 
As a result of several cost-saving actions, we have lowered by $100 million the forecast for R&D for the full year, now at approximately $5.9 billion. Without share-based compensation of approximately $500 million, the forecast for R&D is $5.4 billion, up 5% from 2005. We also continue to find savings in capital spending and have again lowered the forecast for the full year by $400 million to $5.8 billion, plus or minus $100 million. The largest portion of the savings comes from initiatives directed towards improvements and productivity. The estimated tax rate for the fourth quarter is approximately 30%. 
In summary, outstanding new products, leadership and manufacturing technology and disciplined execution point to a stronger second half with seasonal growth as we lay the foundation for 2007. While business remains competitive, we remain focused on doing the right things: delivering compelling products, competing for sales, attacking costs, executing superbly with 65-nanometer and pushing ahead with the next generation. 
With that, let me turn it back to Alex for Q&A. 
 Alex Lenke 
Thanks, Andy. We will now open the conference call for Q&A. We will attempt to take questions from as many participants as possible. To help in this process, we ask that you please limit yourselves to only one question and no more than one brief follow-up. Thank you. 
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from David Wong – AG Edwards. 
 David Wong – AG Edwards 
Thank you very much. Can you just clarify your gross margin guidance for the December quarter? Does it assume any inventory charges? In line with this, can you also give us some feel for your current inventory? How much is older microprocessor product, say 90-nanometer microprocessor product? 
Andy Bryant
David, the forecast for the fourth quarter for gross margin percentage, as I said, we expect to get some benefits from higher revenue. We expect to get some benefit from slightly lower cost per units. That's offset by, I actually mentioned to you three factors: the one factor was some under-load charges in the 90-nanometer network, charges in the 45 nanometer; and quite frankly, the third piece I didn't mention was the fact that we did take some reserves in Q3, we don't plan to take reserves in Q4. So when you do a quarter-to-quarter comparison, that would show as a positive. 
So no, there's no unusual reserves. You know, there's always ins and outs of inventory, but it's kind of flat and normal in the quarter. 
In terms of how much is old versus new, we’ve made the transition, as Paul said, into the new product. If you notice in our inventory, WIP is a huge number, that's all new products. So the inventory is transitioning pretty rapidly into the 65-nanometer product line. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Joe Osha - Merrill Lynch. 
 Joe Osha - Merrill Lynch 
Wow, I made it early this time. Can you give us a sense, again looking at the Conroe versus Presler mix, when that toggle will be complete when you no longer expect to be shipping the older parts? 
Paul Otellini
Well, I think we'd like to like to reserve the right, Joe to use Presler as a dye down in the low end of Pentium and even the value segment over the course of next year. We'll have a number of options down there. But they'll all be 65-nanometer based. 
 Joe Osha - Merrill Lynch 
 So let me rephrase that, then. When do you expect to have the mix in your performance desktop to where you want it to be? 
Paul Otellini
Well, a lot of that has to do with how fast the market moves to Core 2 Duo and that is one we're ramping as fast as we know how to do. As I talked about, I gave you the numbers at IDF and again today. We gave you an additional point on that today, which was we talked about the totality of shipments of core micro architecture which includes Woodcrest, and Woodcrest had over 1 million units in its first 90 days. That one product alone has now achieved over 40% of the entire DP market in its first three months of existence. So we’re very happy with the ramp and will continue to push it real hard in Q4 and Q1. 
 Joe Osha - Merrill Lynch 
Thanks, and just a housekeeping question for Andy. Can you give us some sense as we look into 2007 how we might think about the expense run rate? Might it, if we take the Q4 run rate and map it through '07, or is it going to drop further or go up? Any guidance would be appreciated. 
Andy Bryant
It's really way too early to give you a definitive number. That said, of course, I'll stick my neck out a little bit. I sure would hate to be above Q4. If I could find a way to be a little bit below that, I would. I still think we have room to improve in 2007. 
 Joe Osha - Merrill Lynch 
 Okay. Thank you. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Glen Yeung - Citigroup. 
 Glen Yeung - Citigroup 
Thanks. Andy, this is actually just a follow-up to Joe's last question. If I go back ten years or so ago and we looked at the OpEx as a percentage of sales, you were talking maybe 20% then versus close to 30% now. Is 20% over a longer term period an achievable target? 
Andy Bryant
I don't want to give spending as a percent of every target for long-term. What I would say is, I think as I said, Q4 is a high, not a low. I think we need to let revenue grow and maintain that. So whatever you think revenue is next year, take flat to slightly down through the year for spending and then we'll talk next year about how far we can drive it beyond that. 
 Glen Yeung - Citigroup 
The other point I wanted to question you about is inventory. I think you said it would be slightly down in the fourth quarter. Given how high it is, it's a little surprising. I wonder if you're actively working it down, I would assume that because you are taking some underutilization charges, why not down more? Is there a level to which you're trying to manage these inventory levels that may be different from what we've seen in the past? 
Andy Bryant
You know, it'll be different at different times. As we've done the transition of the Broadwater chipset into the 90-nanometer factories as we begin to tee up for the Broadwater equivalent, for the mobile space; as you ramp the Core 2 Duo products into the 65 nanometer, you can't pull back on those. That is your future, that is the product that will win in the marketplace. 
What you tend to do is drive the new technology, the new products into healthy inventory positions and then you manage the older product down slowly and carefully to make sure you don't get caught without the ability to meet a customer demand. 
I guess it's a long way of saying, yes, I think at today's revenue level it is a little higher than I would like, but through a transition, it's not a bad place to be. 
 Glen Yeung - Citigroup 
Does that imply that we need to see future underutilization charges, just as you sort of balance that out if you're a little bit over-building now, I assume at some point you’ll a little bit under-build just as things start to smooth out a little bit? 
Andy Bryant
No, I don't want to make a factory loading answer for next year before we've given you any insight. It’s our thinking for next year. In general, what I'd tell you is we have looked at the factory network for next year. What I said was the under-loading is in the 90-nanometer 12-inch factory, some of which we plan to convert to leading edge technology, some of which we plan to fill up, like I said, with the 90-nanometer Broadwater equivalent for mobile. 
So I look at the network for next year, and I don't think I have a big problem with excess capacity. It would take a pretty noticeable change in the marketplace for me to be concerned with that. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Sumit Dhanda – Banc of America Securities. 
 Sumit Dhanda – Banc of America Securities
Yes, hi Andy and Paul. A couple of questions. First off as it relates to the fourth quarter outlook for margins, could you help quantify how much benefit you're seeing from lower unit costs? I think at your analyst day you had suggested it would be somewhere between 5% and 10% based on the chart that you'd put up. Whether that still holds true? What's the exact level of offset from the under-loading charges that you're seeing on 90-nanometers and the 45-nanometer start-up cost? 
Andy Bryant
I'll give you partial answers. The under-load charge and the 45-nanometer start-up charge are equal to about 2 points of margin combined. The lower cost of units are providing a small benefit. I haven't looked and compared it to the chart we showed in the analyst meeting. My guess is it is in the neighborhood, maybe not exactly there. Then the other lift is the fact that revenue, if we hit our midpoint will be up a pretty decent 8%. 
 Sumit Dhanda – Banc of America Securities
The second question I had as it relates – I know you said you didn't quite give an exact answer to Joe's question, but -- the $2 billion in cost savings that you're referring to, is there a benchmark that we could use in terms of what number are you really comparing that to? To your expectations back earlier in '06 for '07? How do we think about that? 
Andy Bryant
 I'm essentially going to ask for your patience until January to give you a definitive answer. What it's compared to is when we started the program. So when you think of how to model next year, we have some of the savings in this year's run rates. What we'll do is starting from that point, arbitrarily pick a month. Pick May or June. We would like to cut a run rate $2 billion lower than the run rate was at that point in time. So you have seen Q3 be a little bit lower, you will see Q4 be a little bit lower. That gives you the ability to at least kind of put a point on the map and get close. 
 Sumit Dhanda – Banc of America Securities
 Just one follow-up here. The Asia Pacific sales down double-digits year-over-year; so much growth in those markets occurring. What do you think is the reason why you're not seeing better growth in that market at least from a year-over-year comp basis? Is it just the inventory overhang you have to work through? 
Paul Otellini
That's a bit of it. There’s also been, the Asia Pacific market is a much larger percent of PCs or desktops versus notebooks. The mix is more of the desktop flavor. Desktops are where we saw the most acute price degradation. I think that's probably been the driving factor there more than anything else. 
The other thing that happens in Asia is that the bulk of the notebooks of the world are built there and then trans-shipped back out to customers around the world. 
 Sumit Dhanda – Banc of America Securities
 Okay. Thank you. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Ousha Orji - UBS Securities. 
 Ousha Orji - UBS Securities
Thank you very much. I just have two questions. If I look at your guidance for next quarter, how shall I think about the ASP units data mix, given that we had slightly lower ASP for Q3 which it seems might have been up at least 9% for Q3. Looking into Q4, how should we think about that dynamic, and at what point should we expect the mix of new products to kick in and help stabilize ASPs? 
Andy Bryant
 I actually think the new products are already helping. The price pressure we saw in the third quarter was less than we saw in the second quarter. I'm not going to provide an ASP forecast for the fourth quarter, but again seeing some level of firming based on the new products. So we'll always be in an environment where it's competitive. We'll always be in an environment where price is one of the factors in the marketplaces. 
All I can tell you is that Q2 was worse than Q3 which I think will be worse than Q4. 
 Ousha Orji - UBS Securities
That's great. Just on flash, given that NAND flash is in a wrap-up mode at the moment, you know, it seems to me like all flash may have had a significant weakness. Are you able to provide some color as to what happened there? 
Paul Otellini
Let me take that one. Most of our business is still primarily large customer based. Coming off of the shortages last year, we were not able to move into the channel as rapidly as we would have liked in terms of expanding our product line. And so from my perspective, that probably cost us a little bit of share, offset by a slightly better pricing scenario than we would have had otherwise in NOR. We are looking for NOR to grow, as Andy said, in the fourth quarter. 
Operator
Your next question comes from John Lau - Jefferies and Company. 
 John Lau - Jefferies and Company 
It seems that pricing seems to have firmed up. I was wondering, what are you seeing in the marketplace in terms of the end markets? Are you seeing solid seasonal demand? Is that why the pricing environment is now more benign? Are a lot of the chips that you are putting on the marketplace being absorbed quickly because these end markets are solid? 
Paul Otellini
 I think it's a bit too soon to characterize the market for the fourth quarter, just now getting into that. But it looks very good, it looks seasonal, that’s the guidance you're getting from Intel. 
In terms of the pricing, I think it's more a reflection of two things. It is one, you saw Intel reset its entire price stack, top to bottom, in the last three or four months, which made room when the Core 2 Duo pushed Pentium down, it pushed Celeron down, giving us a three-tier price stack for the first time. That was a rather large price move in the grand scheme of things, perhaps the largest we've ever made. As that played through, the mix started shifting in there, that’s the overwhelming dynamic. 
The second one is how fast the Core 2 Duo ramped, particularly in servers and notebooks where pricing tends to be a little bit better than desktops. 
John Lau - Jefferies and Company
Finally, you mentioned that you're doing quite well in terms of growth in the service space. What would you attribute as the largest reason for that? Is it the Woodcrest that has come out in terms of their performance, power, or the price? 
Paul Otellini
 I think it's a set of very good products around Woodcrest for DP and Tulsa for MP that not only had great price performance metrics, but also had perhaps the most significant scale we've ever had in terms of number of customers, number of SKUs lined up. That was one of the things I think you saw if you went to IDF. You saw customers that had not been with Intel in the last couple of years returning back to Intel very strongly in a lot of the Web 2.0 and Rack kinds of implementations. 
The third point is that we actually had our all-time record quarter for Itanium in last quarter. That really was driven by Montecito and Itanium continues to be a very good product. It gained share and is gaining share against Spark and Power at the high end. So all three of those product lines were beneficial to the overall results in Q3. 
John Lau - Jefferies and Company
The service base has been quite competitive. With the success that you're having and the traction that you're gaining in this marketplace, do you know how much market share you may have gained back in the Q3 timeframe? 
Paul Otellini
 I think it's too soon to call that level of granularity. The people that track this stuff don't even publish it until four months after the quarter. So you won't see this one publicly for a while. But as we said, our view is that by setting an all-time record in server units, we probably gained some share there, on a billings basis. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs. 
 Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs
 Good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much. First question goes back to the pricing issue. I understand pricing has gotten a little bit better over the last couple of quarters, quarter-over-quarter. 
The question is, as you guys continue to gain regain share and your competitor continues to add significant capacity, is there any risk that the competitor gets a little bit over aggressive on pricing and that constrains the kind of margin expansion we expect for next year? How do you think about that? 
 Paul Otellini
 You'll have to ask them what they plan to do on pricing. Let me just address the capacity thing -- not all capacity is equal, Jim. Well over half of our microprocessors are on 65 nanometers now, we're headed towards 100%. Independent of whatever the environment is next year, it's my opinion having seen this for a few decades, that the leading edge capacity and the best products always sell off first. I think Intel is in an extraordinarily good position with both products and capacity coming on and a transition to 45 nanometers coming next year, to do well regardless of the profile of the market. 
 Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs
 So to paraphrase that, the better technology helps you to avoid a real price war like you might have seen over the last 18 months? 
 Paul Otellini
 Price wars tend to happen in the brown banana segments. 
 Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs
Final question for me, on the NOR flash segment, any potential for incremental restructuring in that segment as that maybe lags in profitability a little bit? 
 Andy Bryant
 Well, the operating income for the business unit is actually improving a bit. You can't really see that in the way we break out the numbers because the NAND numbers are combined with the NOR numbers. But you may recall that a couple of quarters ago we shifted the NOR manufacturing and technology development teams over into the NOR business and unleashed them to be able to run any way they need to run to be competitive. We're starting to see the benefits of that shift playing out in our operating expenses and in our factory expenses as we go through the successive quarters. 
 Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs
 Thank you. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers
 Thanks. Paul, I was wondering if you could give us any color on your perception of the share dynamics in maybe the desktop and mobility area? And how, given your guidance, you anticipate that going forward into the end of the year? 
 Paul Otellini
 Well, all I can do is reiterate what we've already said here, Tim. It was a record, we believe we gained some overall share this quarter. We had record unit shipments in servers and notebooks, which are the two fastest-growing segments of the market and desktop is still a very, very competitive area. vPro, which launched in the quarter, is not yet in very high volume at many manufacturers, so you start seeing the impact of that with Core 2 base products later this year in the fourth quarter and first quarter of next year. In terms of the overall share dynamics, we said in April our goal was to gain share throughout this year; that remains our goal. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers
As you move into the year end quarter you have, vis-a-vis normal seasonality perhaps, the benefit of adding a new customer that's reasonably material in the second half of this year, balanced perhaps by the timeline associated with the Vista upgrade. Could you talk a little bit about how either of those factors may be helping you or otherwise adversely impacting you for the year end? 
 Paul Otellini
 I certainly can't give you any insight into our Cupertino-based customer because it would be inappropriate. But so far they've done very well with the transition. I think that the momentum that they had coming into this quarter was really quite good for them, and this is their back-to-school quarter. So, you'll have to wait for their results to come out to talk to them. But I think you'll be happy there. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers
 Vista, just your perceptions of that? 
 Paul Otellini
 Yes, I just got back from the Gartner conference. From an IT perspective, I think Vista is not something that people are exactly waiting for. There's going to be a measured deployment of this, as near as I can tell. At least that was the Gartner view and the CIO view that I saw down there. 
I do think that on the other hand, though, you'll see it be instantaneously adopted, particularly in new machines in the consumer market. So it's probably a lot like we saw with XP where you see a very large chunk of the market, small and medium business consumers move quickly, and enterprise move more slowly. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers
 Does that dampen the fourth quarter then or help it in your opinion? 
 Paul Otellini
 I don't believe so. One of you guys asked me this question last quarter. In the range of the last five years of seasonality, we haven't had a new operating system. So when we talk about seasonality, we're really reflecting the norm without the new one versus what would happen if one had shipped this quarter versus next quarter. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers
 All right, thanks very much. 
Operator
 And, sir our next question is from the line of Adam Parker. 
 Adam Parker - Sanford Bernstein
 Yes, hi, just a couple questions. You keep saying that the desktop market is competitive, Paul and you talked about how leading edge capacity and best products sell first and how you gained some market segment share. Can you talk about the uptick of Conroe? Has that been what you had anticipated? Has it been disappointing at all and what are some of the variables there? 
 Paul Otellini
 The overall uptick of Core 2 Duo in the PC space has been exactly where we thought it would be. Merome has been a little bit better than we thought but Conroe was a little bit looser than we thought. The principal reasons are infrastructure in both cases. Merome plugged into an existing Yonah socket. Conroe , in particular for the high volume SKUs out of the larger multi-nationals, awaited the integrated graphics version of Broadwater, which didn't really ship until September. So the volume was a little bit later in terms of the high volume ramp of that one. The gamers all came out with it and the high-end discrete graphics machines were all out there but the integrated graphics volume price points were a little later in the curve than we first thought. 
I think we're beyond that point now. All of the majors are now shipping with integrated graphics and multiple price points. Now it's just a matter of ramping into the very high volume price points over the next couple of quarters. 
 Adam Parker - Sanford Bernstein
A follow-up is how do you think about raising pricing or improving the pricing environment versus ceding market share? In other words, which variable is more important to you? Because the obvious math says raising pricing is more important and it seems like you're considering more of a duopoly pricing environment; but you seem also focused on market share. I'm trying to figure how you're balancing those two things. 
 Paul Otellini
 I'm very much a believer that the best technology wins. Right now Core 2 Duo, Conroe, Merome and Woodcrest are the best products. The faster we ramp those, the better chance we have of retaking market segment share. We use the Pentium brand as a very effective tool in the channel, in particular to retake share there because it's a healthy product with a good brand name, good recognition, very attractively priced. I don't have a recipe I'm going to give you for share versus pricing because the market doesn't really work that way. I know that it's very important to us in a high capital business to make sure that we maintain and continue to grow our historic share. 
Operator
Sir, our next question is from the line of Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank. 
 Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
 Thanks, guys. Just a couple questions on the pricing environment, trying not to be too repetitive with what other people had asked. Andy, in the past you've given us a little bit of a breakdown in the ASP pressure, whether it was coming from mix or like-for-like price cuts. In this past quarter, can you give us an idea of how that blended together? 
 Andy Bryant
 No, I can't give you much on it. We told you service did well. We told you Core 2 Duo is doing well. Those things are helping. Desktop continues to be the place where you have higher price pressures. So, it's not much difference. You also realize, it wasn't a major factor in the Q3 margin percentage drop. It was just one of three and probably equally weighted. In the fourth quarter, I didn't mention ASP as a factor for margin change. 
 Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
 So going forward, does there come a point that the mix component of ASPs becomes a tailwind rather than a headwind? 
 Andy Bryant
 Again, it's tough to speculate on what ASPs will do next year. There are a lot of different variables. For right now, I want to just leave it. I think the Q4 environment is a little better than Q3 environment. 
 Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Then one final one on the inventory side of the equation. Last quarter you talked a bit about the valuation creep as the new products moved from raw materials to WIP. You mentioned that this quarter, as well. In your guidance for inventory to drop slightly in the out quarter, how should we think about units versus that sort of markup as the new products move to finished goods? 
 Andy Bryant
 Boy, you'll get a very different answer across different parts of the product line. So, if you said 65-nanometer processors, units will go up. If you want 90-nanometer processors, unit will go down pretty markedly. If you go 90-nanometer chipsets, it will go up. If you go older technology chipsets, it will go down. 
So in total and overall, it probably won't change a whole lot, but the quality of the mix will improve pretty dramatically. 
Operator
 And sir, our next question is from the line of Mark Edelstone with Morgan Stanley. 
Mark Edelstone - Morgan Stanley
 Good afternoon, guys. First question for you, Paul, if I could. I think your microprocessor units overall were at record levels in the fourth quarter of last year. We've had down comparisons as we've gone through this year. If you look at fourth quarter of this year, given the expectations for a fairly seasonally normal period, would you expect to get back to record levels for the units overall for the company? 
 Paul Otellini
You know, I haven't actually done that calculation so I'm not sure I would give you the answer if I had it, but I haven't done it. Because you're talking about a different kind of mix now. So, the issue is how fast mobile grows and server grows versus the desktop share of the PC market shrinking. I haven't looked at it in that granularity, Mark, sorry. 
Mark Edelstone - Morgan Stanley
Just a follow-on then, Paul. When you look at 2007 as a whole and you think about the manufacturing footprint that you have, what type of share gains are necessary to keep those fabs fully loaded and to prevent any meaningful increase in inventories from current levels? 
 Paul Otellini
I mean, that's a level of detail and share gain and unit projections that we're not comfortable giving out yet. 
Mark Edelstone - Morgan Stanley
 Then maybe just one for Andy if possible. With the 45-nanometer costs starting to perk up here Andy, what should we think about the rate of ramp as we go through the first half of next year? 
 Andy Bryant
 I won't give you anything new. What I'll tell you is, we do expect it to be a little less than what we saw with 65-nanometer. I'll give you more quantification in January when we start talking about margins for next year. 
Mark Edelstone - Morgan Stanley
 But I guess it's fair to say that from here we'll continue to increase in dollars on a sequential basis? 
 Andy Bryant
 Certainly, through the first half of next year, yes. I haven't looked at the third quarter yet, but through the first half of next year, yes. 
Mark Edelstone - Morgan Stanley
 Okay, thanks, a lot guys. 
Your next question comes from Chris Caso - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey. 
 Chris Caso - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey
I wondered if you could talk about the incremental margins that you guys are seeing with the new micro architecture products? In other words, as those become a larger part of the mix, all else being equal, what do we think about gross margins on a like-for-like basis? Are they generally better margin products than the products that they are replacing? 
 Andy Bryant
Again, I don't want to forecast margin by product. What we know is they cost less. So, I'll tell you I expect to see costs trending down as those become a bigger and bigger percentage. As far as the pricing environment, we don't forecast ASPs for Q4, we're not forecasting ASPs for next year. I can't give you that piece of it. Costs will improve with the new products, yes. 
 Chris Caso - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey
That's the case for each one of the products and each one of the categories: server, desktop and mobile? 
 Andy Bryant
 Pretty much. It may be the dye is a different percentage of the cost of each of the pieces, but the dyes are less expensive in all cases. 
 Chris Caso - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey
 With the headcount reduction and the cost savings that come as a result of that, it looks like most of that is done by the end of this year. As we look at '07, should we assume that most of that cost reduction is realized in the first quarter of the year and then some of it trickles out through the year? 
 Andy Bryant
I wouldn't make that assumption yet. What we said is 95,000 people on board by the end of this year, 92,000 middle of next year, we haven't provided you a number for the end of the year, but my suspicion is it will be a little lower than 92,000. So, you certainly see the biggest effects in Q4, Q1. I think this program continues probably for the next four to five quarters. 
Some of the ideas we have we are pursuing, some of the processes we're reworking, we know will take anywhere from three to four quarters to get implemented. So, yes it continues for a while. Clearly the front end is the biggest end, but I think you'll be able to see improvements, as I said, four to five quarters beyond. 
 Chris Caso - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey
 Okay great. Thank you. 
Operator
 And our next question is from the line of Michael Masdea – Credit Suisse. 
 Michael Masdea – Credit Suisse
 Yes, thanks a lot. In the enterprise market, and mobile and desktop specifically, you guys had a pretty good lock historically. Can you talk, has there been any change in the dynamic, any kinds of designs wins or customer wins from your competitor that are concerning you at this point? 
 Paul Otellini
 Well, every one that they win is one less that we have. So yes, any one would concern us. But I think that we're very pleased as I said earlier, with the scope of the design wins on the new products both at large accounts, smaller new wave accounts and channel. It's been, by any measure, the most successful and broadest product refresh we've ever had. Having the capacity to take advantage of that is really the key to the whole new product structure working out for us. 
 Michael Masdea – Credit Suisse
 So, in other words, your current view on market share suggests you're not going to lose any share and most of your CapEx is built upon that? 
 Paul Otellini
 We are not giving you CapEx for next year yet. But we're certainly not going to put in less capacity than we think we need to serve the market. 
 Michael Masdea – Credit Suisse
 Got it. To follow-up on that point, when you think about your CapEx plan for next year, and I understand that you're not giving it to us yet, how much do you factor in your competitor's capacity? Do you consider that or do you build it really just based upon what the market will bear? 
 Paul Otellini
 Well, we certainly look at it, but as I said earlier, our view is that we factor in our lead on capacity. So we enter the year so far ahead on advanced technology and we exit the year even farther ahead on advanced technology. I believe very strongly that you sell the best products first in this market. That has not changed in two-and-a-half decades of the PC and it's not going to change going forward, in my mind. 
 Michael Masdea – Credit Suisse
 Got you. Just to follow-up on the whole platform strategy, you've talked about in the past being more important going forward, you announced Viiv and vPro. Just give us an update on where those stand and have they lived up to expectations? I know some of them are brand new. 
 Paul Otellini
 Well, Centrino is cranking away, we're in our third generation. We talked about what the fourth generation looks like at IDF by adding NAND and adding new chipsets and adding better a graphics and WiMAX. Viiv is also in its second half of the year in term of shipments. The product line was significantly upgraded over the summer to enable remote wireless, remote broadcast of protected content to large screens around the house. There was a software upgrade for the installed base and new machines. 
I have to say, though, that Viiv is probably suffering from the overall consumer market not being as robust as we first thought 12 months ago. So, as our views of the entire market shifted over the course of this year, Viiv was one of the products that came down along with that. 
Having said that, we're thinking that it's nicely poised for the holiday selling season and people are moving more and more of their content to these kinds of machines. It's the best media machine out there. 
vPro just started shipments and I'm very encouraged by the design wins. But I think this is like any enterprise product, it has its own deployment cycle. 
 Michael Masdea – Credit Suisse
 Great, thank you. 
Operator
Our next question is from the line of David Wu – Global Crown Capital. 
David Wu - Global Crown Capital
 Thank you. Two quick ones. First on the desktop, do you see a change in the competitive dynamics in Asia Pacific, where your competitor is spending a lot of focus on that market and how quickly would that market shift to Conroe, in your opinion? 
The last one is on the flash business, it's [inaudible] numbers but the operating losses are coming down despite lower revenue. I know that NAND flash is ramping over at Intel Micron and I assuming the losses are going to increase with time in '07. How do you balance better profitability in the NOR and losses, presumably increased costs on the NAND side? 
 Paul Otellini
 Let me take the first part and have Andy take the second part. The APAC dynamic on desktops is one that, as I said earlier, really reflects the most heightened sense of competition in the marketplace today for a variety of reasons. Conroe actually had a earlier and stronger uptake in the channel than it did at multinationals, principally because the channel sells more discrete-based graphic machines than the multinationals do traditionally. We saw that take off nicely and it's one of the reasons we saw channel sales throughout the quarter, including the September month. 
So, I'm encouraged with that product there. And the channel players can move quickly, they can offer very good prices and they can try to be in the market before larger competitors and that give them their early to market advantage. 
 Andy Bryant
 On the flash business, there are two separate divisions inside the group. You have the NOR and the NAND. NOR, is quite frankly, making good progress. As we've noted, their revenue was down, that was a disappointment. We lost some share. But if you look at the other dynamics of the business, the spending is lower, getting more efficient, the cost per units are getting lower. New products are coming out, which we think are topnotch products. Get a little revenue growth there and that business is going to start to resemble a well-rounded, dynamic business for us. 
So, the NOR flash business, the same goals. Keep driving revenues, keep controlling costs, keep improving your manufacturing costs. 
NAND is in its start-up phase. We knew that when we approved the program. I would say we're pretty much where we expected to be. If anything, the loss may be a little higher, only because we think the opportunity is good and we're investing a little quicker. What you'll see in the P&L for a while, you're right, a semiconductor business that's in start-up mode, investing in engineering and manufacturing capability ahead of the revenue stream is a couple of pretty tight years. Right now it's on our expectations and as CFO I'd like to see better numbers quicker, but this is what we expected and it's delivering. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Cody Acree - Stifel Nicolaus. 
 Cody Acree - Stifel Nicolaus
 Thanks, guys. Let me ask you about structural gross margins. Andy, maybe for you with Dual Core, with more competitive AMD, if you look out several quarters and really look at the overall mix of things, how does the business look compared to maybe what you've seen in prior cycles when you've ramped in full production on those new products? 
 Andy Bryant
I'm really not ready to give a long-term gross margin. I'll probably never give a long-term one. At the end of the year I'll certainly give more insight than I will now into the next few quarters. 
I will talk about costs. If you look at costs per microprocessors, cost per units and you looked at the time we were putting them on boards, little cards, the costs of the microprocessor doesn't change dramatically over time. We did see one of the few spikes when we when with the first 90-nanometer Dual Core. The new products, we're going to bring the costs back down nicely. It's going to be pretty much in line with historical. Possibly, again, a slight trend down. 
So, where the costs are going, I'm fine with. What will happen on the pricing side, which is the other half of margin has to do with, as Paul says, are our products the best, is the manufacturing technology the best? Can we fill the high end of the stack? How much capacity does AMD have? What do they do with it? So, those questions we need to wait and let some time pass before we answer. The cost side, we can drive. 
 Cody Acree - Stifel Nicolaus
 Great. And then maybe follow-up on AMD's acquisition of ATI, can you talk a little bit about how that's changed the way you look at chipsets and graphics going forward and how you're partnering? How is that changing the environment for you? 
 Paul Otellini
 Well, it doesn't have a significant change. Most of our processors go with our chipsets anyway. Particularly coming out of last year where we had a rather acute shortage of third-party chipsets, we've made plans in terms of capacity planning to be able to handle a larger chunk of our own needs ourselves. I think you see our competitors similarly having a strategy that's trying to do the same thing. 
The real issue is in the discrete graphics market. Obviously, NVIDIA, I believe, will continue to support both parties. I don't know what the plans are from ATI. So from a discrete graphics standpoint, that may be the one element that we have to take a look at. But I think there we're very comfortable with our ability to continue to grow the generational capabilities of integrated graphics by throwing Moore's Law of Transistors at it. 
 Cody Acree - Stifel Nicolaus
 Any thoughts in taking maybe a shot at the discrete graphics again yourself? 
 Paul Otellini
 Well, there's always thoughts. If you're asking plans, I really can't comment. 
Alex Lenke 
 Operator, we'll take two more questions. 
Operator
 Sir, our next question is from the line of Krishna Shankar - JMP Securities. 
Krishna Shankar - JMP Securities
 Yes. As Core 2 Duo ramps up in the desktop space, will that be one of the key factors in helping your desktop ASP stabilize going forward? Or can you talk about the factors which could potentially lead to a desktop ASP stabilizing? 
 Paul Otellini
 I think the Conroe ramp and the Core 2 Duo ramp in general, are one of the reasons that Andy cited confidence on a firmer price environment. 
Krishna Shankar - JMP Securities
The Vista ramp, what do you feel about the adequacy of the Broadwater chipset to handle DX9 and potentially DX10 graphics? 
 Paul Otellini
 Actually, Broadwater, is to my knowledge, is the first DX10 capable machine out there. It is qualified for Vista Gold or it is capable of handling Vista Gold when Vista Gold comes out on the high end of the line. We worked very closely with Microsoft to make sure that happens so the majority of computer users can have the best graphic experience. 
Krishna Shankar - JMP Securities
 Great. Thank you. 
Operator
Sir, our final question is from the line of Gus Richard - First Albany Capital. 
 Gus Richard - First Albany
 Thanks so much for taking my question. On the NOR flash business, the decision to stay in that business, is that more strategic or is it P&L driven? And if it's strategic, where does it fit in going forward? 
 Andy Bryant
That's a business that we believe has to provide a return and pay for itself and that's what we're trying to get it reshaped in order to do. As I've said, we're making progress. We have more to go, obviously. 
 Gus Richard - First Albany
 Got it. Then in terms of improving performance, you've got 45 nanometer coming out next year and then a new architecture after that. Which one -- could you sort of handicap which one is going to drive MIPS or what is going to drive performance? Is it going to more the processor or more the architecture? 
 Paul Otellini
 It's both. At IDF, I know I talked about this. We said that going forward from today forward over the rest of this decade we're going to deliver a 300% increase in performance per watt based upon that road map we put up there. Some of that comes through the capability that the transistor budget gives you, which is one element of the technology transition. The other is that we will continue to drive for lower power capability and lower leakage orientation at the transistor level, which helps the performance per watt independent of what the performance is. 
So the new silicon technologies are being optimized much more than they were in the old days for mobility, for power-friendly environments, for low leakage, that kind of stuff. 
 Gus Richard - First Albany
 Got it. Thank you.

Thank you, Alex. In April, I said that the second quarter would be a time to work with our customers on inventory levels and prepare to launch a new generation of microprocessors. We achieved those objectives during Q2 and are well positioned for the second half. 
Second quarter revenue was in the range we said in April, with microprocessor unit shipments meeting our expectations but with pricing more competitive. We believe we lost a bit of microprocessor market segment share on a billings basis, but we gained a bit of a share on a consumption basis adjusting for inventory reductions. 
Intel's factories continue to lead the industry in the conversion to new technology. We opened our third 65-nanometer facility in Q2, with over 50% of our microprocessor wafer starts now on dual-core products. 
In June, we initiated a major transition to the new core micro-architecture. We launched Woodcrest, the world's best processor for two-way volume servers, that is delivering clear platform leadership in both performance and performance-per-watt. 
For multiprocessor servers, we pulled in the Tulsa processor launch by two quarters to Q3, and have begun shipping that product for revenue. We expect Tulsa-based platforms to deliver industry-leading transaction performance in X-86 servers. 
Yesterday we launched our next generation Itanium processor, code name Montecito, which uses dual-core technology to double Itanium processor performance at 20% lower power. 
Additionally, we notified customers that we are pulling in both a desktop and a server version of our first quad-core processors into the fourth quarter of this year from the first half of 2007. 
In the PC segment, we are very excited about Conroe, our upcoming Core 2 Duo microprocessor for the desktop, which offers 40% more performance and 40% lower power than our previous best. Conroe will be launched on July 27th and is already setting new PC performance and performance-per-watt records across the board. 
Merom, our Core 2 Duo processor for mobile PCs, will extend our lead in mobile computing and has planned to ramp very quickly as it fits into the existing Centrino Duo platform. 
Both Conroe and Merom have now qualified and have shipped for revenue. Each is approximately one month ahead of the schedules that we laid out in our analyst meeting in April. In total, we have shipped 5 new dual-core microprocessors in the last 30 days, delivering new levels of energy efficient performance into every segment we serve. 
Intel's chipset business had a good quarter, and 65-nanometer ramps, chipsets are rapidly moving to 90-nanometer on 300 millimeter wafers, giving us both better products and greater capacity. 
The Broadwater chipset for Core 2 Duo desktops began shipping in early June, with very healthy yields and a record ramp. This chipset is the industry's first on 90 nanometers, and it includes a version with programmable fourth generation graphics, along with advanced features for manageability, power management and a significantly improved memory controller. 
There has been much speculation about pricing changes and I would like to provide you some context. 
The introduction of the Core 2 Duo processors enabled us to reset our entire microprocessor line-up, giving us a three-tiered brand strategy of good, better, best. Core 2 Duo is the best PC microprocessor in the world, and we will ramp it as rapidly as possible. 
Our leadership with Core 2 Duo allows us to lower the price of Pentium, which is the best known processor brand in the world, to system price points not previously addressed by this brand. 
Celeron remains Intel's brand for extremely cost sensitive designs. 
We believe that these three brands, combined with our lead in 65-nanometer technology and capacity, give Intel a unique competitive advantage. We will accelerate Dual-core penetration into more segments than ever before, giving Intel a compelling technology advantage at every price point. 
Turning to operations, we have finalized our plans to take $1 billion out of Intel projected spending in 2006. 
At the analyst meeting in April, I also spoke about a comprehensive structural review project designed to produce a leaner and more agile company for 2007 and beyond. One result of this program is the planned sale of our applications and communication processor business to Marvell announced last month. In addition, last week we announced the difficult action of eliminating 1,000 management positions throughout the company. 
We are now a bit over half-way through the structural review process, which is not about any singular announcement, but rather about a series of significant and well-considered actions that will improve our competitiveness and operating efficiency. We will continue to discuss these actions with you as they occur. 
In summary, we have a tight handle on spending and are making good progress on identifying ways to improve our efficiency and agility for the long-term. At the same time, we are delivering the best new microprocessors in the world and we use our manufacturing leadership to drive the industry's transition to Dual-core in all market segments. 
With that, I will hand the call over to Andy. 
Andy Bryant
Thanks, Paul. The second quarter was the time for facing the challenges of the market, while moving ahead with plans to improve our products and capabilities. Competition, market softness, a product mix shift in customer inventory levels entering the quarter, were among the challenges. 
In growth and servers, chipsets for mobile computers and communications infrastructure were among the bright spots. 
While we have trimmed the outlook for gross margin for the year, we continue to tackle the cost structure with reductions in capital spending, R&D, and headcount. We have also reduced our level of cash and the number of shares outstanding. 
As Paul stated, we made excellent progress in pushing forward with new products to support a stronger second half. 
Revenue for the second quarter was $8 billion, at the low-end of our forecast in April, and down 10% from the first quarter. Most of the sequential change in revenue came from lower average selling prices and unit volumes of microprocessors for the desktop and notebook segments. 
Average selling prices declined as the market moved a bit to lower price mix within both performance and value segments in an unusually competitive pricing environment. In all geographies and in the channel, revenue was lower than seasonal, indicating some overall softness in the PC market segment. 
Some of the decline also can be attributed to customers working through first quarter inventory. We believe we have met our goal to get customer inventories of our products in balance with business levels and in an appropriate mix for our new product ramp. 
Chipsets and other products in the mobility group delivered revenue growth of 16%. In the server business, revenue was up on improving average selling prices and unit volumes. In a year to year comparison, quarterly revenue was down approximately $1.2 billion, or 13%. Revenue in the digital enterprise group was down 23%, while revenue for the mobility group was up slightly. Among the geographies, the year to year revenue decline was highest in Europe, which was down 24%, and Asia-Pacific, which was down 14%. Japan's revenue was up 3%, marking the 15th consecutive quarter of year-to-year revenue growth. 
Gross margin dollars of $4.2 billion, including share-based compensation of $66 million, were down 16% from the first quarter. Gross margin percentage was 52.1% on a GAAP basis. Without share-based compensation, gross margin percentage was 52.9%. A decrease from the first quarter of 3.4 points on a non-GAAP basis came primarily from lower average selling prices for microprocessors, lower overall unit volume for microprocessors, and a mix shift or lower margin product in certain areas, offset somewhat by lower inventory write-downs. 
In April, our quarterly forecast for gross margin percentage, excluding share-based compensation, was 50% plus or minus a couple points. The improvement of 2.9 points from the midpoint of the forecast was a function of better-than-expected inventory evaluations, including qualification for production for some new products and improvements in unit cost for chipsets and microprocessors, offset by the mix-shift in microprocessors toward products with lower average selling prices. 
In a year-to-year comparison, gross margin percentage, excluding share-based compensation, is 3.5 points lower than the second quarter of 2005, primarily as a result of lower revenue, offset somewhat by lower start-up costs. 
Spending, R&D and MG&A was $3.1 billion, in line with our forecast in April. Excluding share-based compensation of $266 million, spending decreased by approximately 3% from the first quarter but is up 12% from a year ago. Spending has grown as a percentage of revenue. However, cost-cutting efforts are in the initial phases. 
The number of employees declined during the quarter to 102,500, which does not reflect the loss of 1,400 people we expect to be employed by Marvell, and 1,000 people whose positions were recently eliminated. With these actions and attrition, we expect the number of employees to be below 100,000 by the end of the year. 
Fully diluted earnings per share were $0.15. Excluding share-based compensation, earnings per share would have been $0.19. 
Quarterly average shares outstanding are down nearly 6% from a year ago. 
On the balance sheet, inventories of $4.3 billion were up over $750 million from the first quarter, as we ramp production of microprocessors on a 65-nanometer process and produced associated chipsets. 
The Conroe microprocessor qualified for production during the quarter and contributed to higher inventories, as did the Broadwater chipset. Broadwater ramped nicely and had good demand, which provided better unit cost and lower than expected write-downs. 
We continue to reduce the levels of cash. Total cash investments, comprised of cash, short-term investments, and fixed income trading assets, ended the quarter at $7.2 billion, down by $1.5 billion from the first quarter. 
Stock repurchases were $1 billion. Capital spending was $1.7 billion, and dividend payments were nearly $600 million. 
As a reminder, we indicated in April that we expect to reduce the level of our stock repurchases over coming quarters to less than half the first quarter rate as we continue to manage our cash flow. 
As we turn now to the outlook for the third quarter, please keep in mind that the forecast data do not include the effect of any new acquisitions, divestitures, or external transactions that may be completed after July 18th. I will use a mid-point of forecast ranges when making comparisons to specific periods. 
We are planning for revenue in the third quarter to be between $8.3 billion and $8.9 billion, an increase of approximately 7.5%, in line with seasonal patterns. If revenue for the second quarter is adjusted for the inventory burn, then the growth rate for the third quarter forecast would be at the low end of seasonal patterns. This forecast for Q3 assumes higher revenue than the second quarter for microprocessors, chipsets, and flash memory. 
Our expectations for gross margin percentage in the third quarter is 49%, plus or minus a couple points. Without share-based compensation of approximately 1 point of margin, the forecast for gross margin percentage is 50%, plus or minus a couple points. 
Higher microprocessor unit costs, as we ramp production of the Dual-core product, and some erosion in average selling prices will lower gross margin percentage, while higher unit volumes will partially offset the decrease. 
Keep in mind that gross margin in the second quarter benefited from the qualification of new products. 
Spending, R&D plus MG&A should be approximately $3 billion. The forecast includes approximately $300 million of share-based compensation. Without the impact of these charges, spending should be approximately $2.7 billion. This level of spending is flat to down slightly from the second quarter on higher revenue, and indicates some progress at reducing spending as a percent of revenue. 
Looking beyond the third quarter, we anticipate a fourth quarter with seasonal growth from the third quarter. In the last ten years, growth from the third to fourth quarter has varied widely, and averaged approximately 10%. This is likely to result in annual revenue for the year that is lower than our outlook in April, when we forecast a decrease of approximately 3% compared to 2005 within a wide range of variability. 
We expect gross margin percentage for the year to be 51%, plus or minus a few points. Without share-based compensation of approximately 1 point of margin, the forecast is 52%, plus or minus a few points. The adjustment in the forecast reflects lower revenue, primarily due to lower ASPs. The main causes of the decline from 59.4% in 2005, are lower prices of microprocessors, higher unit costs as we move to Dual-core, and higher cost for chipsets mitigated by lower start-up costs. 
As a result of several cost savings actions, we have again lowered the forecast for R&D and capital spending for the year. The forecast for R&D is now $100 million lower, at approximately $6 billion. This brings us to our previous goal for total spending for R&D, marketing, and G&A of $12.1 billion. Without share-based compensation of approximately $500 million, the forecast for R&D is $5.5 billion, up 7% from 2005. 
Without share-based compensation of approximately $600 million, the forecast for total spending is $11 billion, essentially flat with 2005. This includes spending for the IM flash technology joint venture. 
We have also lowered the capital spending forecast by $400 million to $6.2 billion, plus or minus $200 million. 
The estimated tax rate for the third and fourth quarters of 2006 is unchanged at approximately 30.5%. 
In summary, we look ahead to our business improving in the second half, with outstanding new products and seasonal growth. While business remains competitive, we are focused on doing the right things -- delivering compelling products, competing for sales, proceeding with systematic and comprehensive cost-cutting, and executing superbly with 65-nanometer, while laying the groundwork for the next generation. 
With that, let me turn it over to Alex for Q&A. 
Alex Lenke
Thanks, Andy. We will now open the conference call for Q&A. We will attempt to take questions from as many participants as possible. To help in this process, we ask that you please limit yourselves to only one question, and no more than one brief follow-up. Thank you.

(Operator Instructions) 
Your first question comes from the line of Sumit Dhanda with Banc of America Securities. Please proceed. 
Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Securities
Andy, I had a couple of questions. First, it seems, at least on a sequential basis, the notebook business was off fairly significantly. Conversely, the mobile chipset business did very well. Could you help us understand what occurred there? 
Secondly, you have indicated that cost on the dual-core ramp will impact margins significantly for Q3. Is the expectation still that this will start to be a little bit of a tailwind in Q4, as you had indicated at the analyst day, or has that changed? Thank you. 
Andy Bryant
On the cost one, I would expect us to start to see the turnover in cost units in the fourth quarter, and continuing into next year. My guess is the expensive dual-core product peak will be in the third quarter, and we will start to see the newer products have meaningful effect in the fourth quarter. In terms of the notebook... 
Paul Otellini
Why don't I take that one? In general, what we are seeing is an expansion of the notebook segment as a percent of the overall PC market. In the second quarter shipments, we saw quite a bit of expansion shipped, if you will, in the mix from the high end to the low end, principally driven by retail purchases. Consumer notebooks tend to sell for a lot less than business notebooks and they tend to use a lower-end microprocessor. 
There may also have been some hesitation in front of our price move and in front of our Merom launch, so I think those three things combined to get you to the… The chipset business is up in mobile, which indicates the continuing growth in mobile. We have a fairly high market segment share in mobile chipsets anyway, so I think that one is a good leading indicator on where the notebook business is going, in terms of what you see. 
Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Securities
Okay, thank you. 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Tim Luke with Lehman Brothers. Please proceed. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers
Thank you. Andy, with respect to the inventory levels, could you give us a sense on how you would expect them to look going forward, based on-hand, and maybe what you perceive in the channel? I was also wondering if you could give any color with respect to your guidance as a midpoint to 07 of how we should view the unit growth versus the ASP direction? Thank you. 
Andy Bryant
In terms of inventory levels, I will give a long-winded answer, because I also want to explain a little bit about the second quarter, which [multiple speakers] …up over $750 million. If you remember at the beginning of the quarter, we expected a little less than half of that. We knew we would be trying to ramp Broadwater in that period of time. We did not expect Conroe to qualify until the third quarter. 
So what happened, if you look inside the quarter, the surprise increase in inventory is several hundred million for the Conroe product line, better health in Broadwater, so I took lower inventory reserves there. A third element is in the second quarter, my mix was a little lower so I had a little more dual-core content in inventory, so it is a little higher. 
Essentially what I am trying to paint to you is what happened in the second quarter is I built a lot of product that is 65-nanometer processors and 90-nanometer chipsets, which is why I think is an okay thing. 
Going into the third quarter, I would expect profits to be about flat. We had a big profit evaluation in the second quarter for the Conroe and Woodcrest. I would expect chipsets to still grow a little bit. I still think we are digging ourselves out of the chipset hole. At some point, we made steps to turn that over but not in the third quarter. 
So overall, expect a little increase in the third quarter, but I do not think it is a big increase. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers
Sort of the $200 million, the same kind of range that you advocate or you thought before? That kind of framework? How should we view that? 
Andy Bryant
Well, I hate to put a number on it. That's an acceptable magnitude. If I were to see $200 million, it would not startle me. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers
Then you would expect it to go down, obviously, in the calendar fourth quarter? 
Andy Bryant
I would expect fourth quarter to start to turn that down, yes. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers
Can you give us any framework there? 
Andy Bryant
As bad as I was at forecasting inventory in Q2, I want to wait but yes, I would expect a slight increase in the third quarter, a slight decrease in the fourth. 
Your other question was? 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers
Was with respect to the midpoint of your revenue grade, your expectations in terms of how we should think about unit growth and ASPs. Should we think about ASPs coming down a little bit? 
Andy Bryant
ASPs do come down a bit in the third quarter. We do see a pretty tough pricing environment. 
If you look inside the second quarter, we came in at the low-end of our range and most of that was ASPs. If you look at the units we shipped into the marketplace, if you look at the units we think our customers burnt out of the inventories, it came in almost exactly has we had forecasted to you guys in April. The surprise was it was a little bit lower mix, a little bit lower price. 
When I look at my full year, even though our full year, if you do the math, is going to be down a fair amount, it is mostly pricing. The unit environment, the demand for product seems pretty normal in terms of purchasing -- a little weak, so don't change your mind -- again, we know Q1, Q2 was a little weak, but I would paint a normal second half off of the first half in terms of units. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers
ASPs in the mid-single-digit decline, is that what I should think about in the third quarter? Just some kind of approximation? 
Andy Bryant
I cannot go to that level of granularity. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers
So despite the normal units, you have the extra inventory and you think the inventory goes up in the third quarter, what do you think is normal units then? 
Andy Bryant
Again, go back and look at Gardner or anybody else's unit demand in Q3’s of years gone by. It is not too far off for revenue as well. You can get pretty close. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers
Thank you, guys. 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Joe Osha with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed. 
Joe Osha - Merrill Lynch
You are saying that you qualified Conroe more quickly than thought, so those wafers become part of inventory as opposed to just flowing through the P&L, right? 
Andy Bryant
That's correct, and that was about $200 million worth. 
Joe Osha - Merrill Lynch
First question then, why does that not show up in the R&D, which basically came in where you thought? As I look at this, and I look at… 
Andy Bryant
Slow down, slow down -- not so fast. 
Joe Osha - Merrill Lynch
Okay. 
Andy Bryant
If the product had not qualified, the expense would have not been in R&D. It would have been in other costs of sales, similar to our start-up costs. So what it does is it flips out of cost of sales into inventory. 
Joe Osha - Merrill Lynch
Okay. 
Andy Bryant
Our margin being a couple of points high, this is part of the reason, but with inventory being a $200 million high, again, they kind of balance. 
Joe Osha - Merrill Lynch
Okay. Second question, as I look at the timing and the mix of your ramp, it seems to me like an awful lot of this inventory addition has got to be dual-core Pentium D, right? Which is the expensive-to-manufacture part that you are going to sell and then end-of-life over the next couple of quarters, right? 
Andy Bryant
Some of it is, yes. There was an increase in inventory of that product. 
Joe Osha - Merrill Lynch
Okay. As I look, I do some back-of-the-envelope math here, I see your SG&A and your R&D falling off in Q4. As I think of 2007, how should I think about the run rates for those operating expense lines? 
Andy Bryant
I would think they are going down again, as Paul -- it is going to be hard for me to give you a magnitude. As Paul said, we are going through efficiency project evaluations now. We would be very disappointed not to see a significant dollar savings as we get into next year, but I really would like to finish that project before I give you a number. 
Joe Osha - Merrill Lynch
Just to clarify, down from the Q4 run rate, or down '07 on '06? The numbers, as I look at that Q4 run rate, are you saying that it goes down from there? 
Andy Bryant
Again, since we are not done with the work yet, I am giving you a bias that I do not have studied numbers behind, okay? My belief is it is down from the Q4 run rate and down year over year, both. 
Joe Osha - Merrill Lynch
Okay. Paul, may I ask one philosophical question before I go away? 
Paul Otellini
Certainly. 
Joe Osha - Merrill Lynch
You have a great new product lineup, and I think everybody knows that. Why on earth run up inventory like this? It creates a problem that appears to me to be obscuring the progress you would otherwise be making. 
Paul Otellini
I do not think that we are running up inventory or creating a problem. If you look at the history of Intel, we generally take care of our inventory pretty well. If I have made one mistake in the last two years, it was that we did not build enough chips at inventory at the right time in second half '04, early '05. That got us in trouble in terms of market share and got us in trouble in terms of our customers and everything else. 
We think that we are starting wafers on the right products now and I am very comfortable with the current build plans and factory loadings. 
Joe Osha - Merrill Lynch
 Thank you. 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Krishna Shankar with JMP Securities. Please proceed. 
Krishna Shankar - JMP Securities 
Yes, Andy, you talk about the $1 billion in operating expense, the savings there. Should we be looking at $1 billion taken out of part of op-ex between 2007 versus what the new guidance is for 2006? Can you give us some time frame for that op-ex reduction? 
Andy Bryant
The $1 billion out of this year essentially kept us flat to last year. I want everyone to understand, it is not like we cut a billion out of last year's total. We cut a billion out of our run rate, which got us to flat. 
What will happen next year is going to be more a function of what happens in the efficiency project. I do expect it to go down. I do expect it to go down from Q4, but I really need to finish the work to know how much. I know you would like to have a number. I have to resist at this point but again, I expect to make real progress next year. I expect it to be a lower number. 
Krishna Shankar - JMP Securities 
Paul, on the three-tiered pricing structure that you spoke about, does this imply a long tail to the NetBurst networks, where you have the three-brand structure, or should we anticipate a pretty quick flash out of the Pentium 4 NetBurst architecture? 
Paul Otellini
We have the opportunity to use a number of micro-architectural dye in that brand. I do not think it implies a long tail to NetBurst as much as it implies a long tail to using Pentium and bringing that into newer, lower price points. 
In particular, we find this an intriguing opportunity in emerging markets, where Pentium is quite well known but as a percent of the overall sales, because of price points of systems, it has not been the predominant line item in the Intel lineup. By having new systems, new CPU price points, we enable new system price points for Pentium in these markets, and we think that is an advantage to us. 
Krishna Shankar - JMP Securities 
Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis. Please proceed, sir. 
Mark Lipacis - Prudential Equity Group
Two brief questions. First, Andy, can you give us a sense of the cash flow from operations for the quarter? 
Andy Bryant
Cash flow from operations for the quarter -- no, I do not have that number with me. We did a $1 billion in buy back, we pulled cash down a little bit. It is probably some positive, but not a big number. I would have to get that, I do not have that. 
Mark Lipacis - Prudential Equity Group
Okay, fair enough. Second question, of the inventory that you have on the books, can you give us a sense of what percentage of those are from the new micro-architecture products? 
Andy Bryant
If you look at the total, it's an odd answer. If you look at the growth of $750-some million, it is most of it. If you look at dual-core and you look add Broadwater, we grew in those spaces -- essentially all of the growth. You still have flash, you still have communications products, you still have motherboards -- all of those products are still there at about the same level they have been. 
Mark Lipacis - Prudential Equity Group
Thank you very much. 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of John Lau with Jefferies. Please proceed. 
John Lau - Jefferies & Co. 
In terms of questions about your relationships with your major customer and the rumors about expanding usage from your competitor, what are the key issues that you think are driving the decisions? With new products out, is it performance anymore? Is it more pricing, supply chain management -- what are the key levers for the decision process now that you have your new products out, Paul? 
Paul Otellini
I tend to be pretty monolithic in this thinking. I think it is a bit of all of the above, but technology and good products tend to be the overarching drivers of success in our industry. 
You have seen the write-ups on the new products, the new micro-architectures. You have seen customers talking about them in a very positive fashion. You have seen the press talking about them in very positive fashion. 
I think at the end of the day, our job is to make sure we build the best products. Great new products very often ignite markets -- examples, Centrino a few years back, and I think that with this new class of products, we can perhaps lift the entire market as we go forward. 
Independent of that, the addition of those products gives us a much better competitive posture, particularly when you look at the three-brand strategy now. 
John Lau - Jefferies & Co. 
Along the lines of expanding the new markets, Paul, you do have the dual-cores now, quad cores coming by the end of the year. In terms of how the migration path in the market place when you have these new products in, what is the typical time in which you are going to see those next killer applications? Is it about a year away, or nine months from now? 
Paul Otellini
Well, it depends on a -- segment by segment. In the server segment, quad core doesn't need new software. Server software today is all threaded, so it just takes advantage of that as long as you can keep the pipelines full. We have done a pretty good job on architecting that to get high efficiency out of those quad-core machines. These are dual processor quad core machines. 
In the extreme gamer community, the quad core also can be readily adopted quite quickly because the software is tuned for it. Ditto on the workstation business. 
When you start talking about mainstream microprocessors, I agree, we have a ways before the applications can take advantage of all of that horsepower, but it is not that far away. Most people are running multi-tasking environments today already. 
John Lau - Jefferies & Co. 
Great. Thank you. 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Michael McConnell with Pacific Crest Securities. Please proceed. 
Michael McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities 
Thank you. Paul, just a longer term question with respect to pricing for the microprocessor industry. Obviously we have seen some of your larger customers begin to use your competitor on a more broader basis than at any time we have seen in history. If we look at the new product lineup, which looks like it is going to be much more competitive, are we expecting ASPs to begin to move up as we progress with the ramp of core-dual into next year? 
Paul Otellini
I do not think we are giving out ASP guidance today, Michael, so I am going to avoid that. 
I think the criteria is going to be, how does the mix settle out, geography by geography, quarter by quarter? In terms of the percent of our products that are going to be dual-core micro-architecture based versus Pentium versus Celeron. I think that we have not had this kind of lineup in a long time, and we certainly have never had a three-brand strategy. 
To the extent that we can create pull and demand around these new products, you can get some lift. I will tell you that we have shifted virtually all of our direct advertising in the second half of this year to focus on Core 2 Duo, and you will start seeing those in billboards and print ads and television ads throughout the second half, particularly as we move into the peak selling season, from Labor Day on. 
Michael McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities 
One follow-up, just on the restructuring. You said in the prepared comments that headcount could fall below 100,000 by the end of the year. There has been some pretty large numbers going around in terms of the amount of employees we could be seeing reductions for. Not trying to read the tea leaves, but should we be thinking that the restructuring or the employee reductions will not be on a very broad basis, or maybe more tempered? 
Andy Bryant
Do not make that connection, yes. What you should be thinking of, if we did no new restructuring activity, I will get it below 100,000. We believe between now and to the next two months, we will make a variety of decisions, some of which may have [inaudible] headcount implications yet this year, which would take the number down even lower. So I am not making that next statement yet. 
On what we have done today, I will get below 100. We may have actions that will take it even lower before the end of the year. 
Michael McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities 
Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Masdea with Credit Suisse. Please proceed. 
Michael Masdea - Credit Suisse
Thank you. When we looked at your '06 estimate, you talked about how we have seen it go from the high-single digits now to the low, an increase to a high-single digit decrease. You stated a lot of that was really due to the ASP side. Help me understand kind of how that kind of happens. What kind of environment really led to that pricing environment? What gives you confidence that we are not going to see that again in your ability to forecast that we are not going to see that again? 
Andy Bryant
Well, it is possible it will happen again. If you go through the math, we have a relatively wide range in Q3, and we said Q4 will be seasonal off whatever that final number would be. So right now, I am not picking a number for the year and saying thank God I finally figured it out. The environment we found ourselves in the second quarter, ASPs were down [inaudible] to price for two reasons. One is the competitive price environment, and one, it was a little bit lower mix than we expected. 
What we have done is assumed the competitive price environment stays. As Paul said, the product lineup gets stronger and stronger. Hopefully that allows us to gain some traction there. We have made a forecast that says we think that there will be a “normal” Q4 off of the third quarter, which is 7.5% off of a weak Q2. 
I do not think it is a particularly aggressive forecast for the rest of the year, but I certainly do not have a forecasting track record this year that says I can bet on it. 
Michael Masdea - Credit Suisse
That is fair enough. Then on the inventory side, given where we are now and given what you said about production and everything else, are you thinking about any sort of difference in your inventory target in terms of days going forward? Has it changed at all? Should we read anything into the cap-ex in terms of what you think production should be versus demand? 
Andy Bryant
A couple things there. In terms of “inventory strategy”, no, I think we are in the middle of a product transition, and in the middle of a product transition, you want to aggressively build the new products and then carefully manage the older products. That is what we are doing. Hopefully up a little in the third quarter, down some in the fourth quarter, see where the market is and then figure out what we need to do for the rest of next year. 
If you asked me would I like to see it be lower, of course. If you ask me if I am concerned where it is, the answer is no because we need to make this product transition. 
On the capital spending side, think of it in two ways. One is, of the reduction of the midpoint by $400 million, half of it is essentially slower construction spending. So we have all of the same construction projects we thought we would have. We just slowed down some, which means some spending falls into next year instead of this year. 
The other half, about $200 million, actually comes from, I hate to use this word, it's not the “efficiency” project, but when a company starts to focus on getting more efficient, you start to find ways to increase utilization of tools. In this case, almost all of the second $200 million comes from the back-end processor [inaudible], where we found a way to increase the loadings into the equipment in those factories and we can save a couple hundred million dollars. 
We do not think it changes our capacity. We think it is just better use of the capacity we plan to have. 
Michael Masdea - Credit Suisse
So in other words, you are going to reassess at the end of the year, based on what you have done in the second half of this year and what ’07 looks like in terms of… 
Andy Bryant
In terms of inventory, yes. In terms of capital, I hope that through this project, I find six more ways to increase my utilization of my equipment and save some more money. 
Michael Masdea - Credit Suisse
Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Adam Parker. Please proceed. 
Adam Parker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. 
Just one on inventory and one around wireless. I am still not sure. I heard Paul say you do not think you are running up inventory, and Andy, you said this is kind of what happens in the middle of a product transition. I guess I’m wondering, what level would you be concerned about it? If I look at days of inventory, it is basically among the highest it has ever been, so why is that the wrong thing to look at? If it is only slightly up and it is slightly down the next couple of quarters, doesn't it create a problem heading into '07? Is there a risk you have to take, a big reserve here? Help me understand why you are so comfortable when history implies that you are in a danger zone here on inventory. 
Andy Bryant
I don't think history implies I'm in a danger zone on inventory. It does show it is higher than it has historically been, but at $4.3 billion of inventory, that is about one-quarter’s worth cost of sales. That is not a danger zone, especially when you have a 13-week prepare time anyway. I am not uncomfortable with the level of inventory. Would I like it to be less? Of course. I would always like to manage it more tightly, but it does not lead to big write-offs. I am pretty comfortable with that situation. 
Now if you're telling me demand is going to fall off the table next year and I am going to have to unload factories, then it will be low. 
Keep in mind what Paul says -- the last time we built inventory, it was not quite this magnitude but it was a big number, we jerked down the factories, created shortages in chipsets, affected our microprocessor business. We are going to try to make sure this time we do not overreact to a one-quarter inventory build, particularly since we think we have built all the right stuff. 
Adam Parker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. 
So you are viewing this as just kind of a one-quarter build, because it seems like it is more than that. When you guys had guided on your analyst day, you had said the net value of our microprocessor inventory will be down in Q2, and now it looks like, because of this qualification, it is up. I am just trying to figure out, could you have -- maybe it's a follow-up on Masdea’s question, could you have structurally higher days of inventory for the next year? 
Andy Bryant
You could, but that is certainly not a conscious decision we have made. In the analyst day, we did say microprocessor inventory would be flat to down, no question. Again, I did not count on Q2 qualifying Conroe and Woodcrest for $200 million, so that was not in my thinking envelope before. 
The other thing that happened was we shipped from previously reserved inventories, so some of the lower-end mix products, I did not expect to ship those things. When I shipped those and replaced them with higher value dual-core in inventory, again, it grows a little bit. 
So yes, I would say that the first 200 is good news surprise. The fact that my inventory mix is a little richer, I will not call it a good news surprise but I will call it an understood surprise. 
In essence, it is not a place I am concerned about today. Now, if it grows another $800 million next quarter, then you can… 
Adam Parker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. 
Have you ever been concerned about it in the past? I mean… 
Andy Bryant
Have I been? Yes, I was concerned two years ago. I was the one who convinced Craig and Paul to slow down our inventories. I take responsibility for that and I was wrong. 
Adam Parker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. 
I guess what I'm saying is it looks so much worse now than it did two years ago, particularly because the demand outlook, if you look at GDP projections from economists, looks weaker now than it did at the same point two years ago. It seems hard on the surface, unless you are just explaining it largely as the new products, or all as the new products and the chipset ramp, the optics of it seem more difficult to understand for us dumb guys. 
Andy Bryant
I beg to differ. I think two years ago, we were looking at a potentially weaker economy. We also were looking at an overbuild that we had put in place for Prescott, which we knew was going to be a weak-yielding part to begin with, and it yielded well. We can relive the history, if you want. 
Adam Parker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. 
Actually, if you look in Q2 of '04 at what the GDP projections were for the biggest 20 countries for the second half of the year and you compare them to what they are right now for the second half of this year, it looks weaker at this point now than it did two years ago. That is what I am worrying about, is you are going to get capacity growth exceeding revenue growth and have a further inventory build, and then your margins are impeded for longer than you currently expect, but it sounds like you have comfort around that. 
Andy Bryant
It is possible. What we have built in for the rest of the year is, like we said, it's a seasonal back-half off of a weak first half. If you tell me you think the worldwide economy is going into recession, I will have an inventory problem. 
Adam Parker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. 
Right, well, we will all have problems. The other thing I wanted to ask about was just the wireless sale. Is there anything about that you embedded into your Q3 guides in terms of revenue? 
Andy Bryant
We think the business closes in the fourth quarter, so we kind of have it for the third quarter. 
Adam Parker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. 
I'm sorry, say that again? I could not hear you. 
Andy Bryant
We think the sale closes in the fourth quarter. We have it in the fourth quarter. 
Adam Parker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. 
Okay, so the sale of this business, can you talk now that it's kind out, can you kind of remind us what -- I know, Andy, you do these kind of ten-year MPVs on your businesses, and obviously the assumptions there dramatically change but in retrospect, what can we learn from what happened to your original expectations, given a couple of years ago this was looked at a real big contributor to your future growth. How did that really change? 
Paul Otellini
Well, I think our view of the markets evolved. Remember, we always aimed that business at the Smartphone market and our ability to penetrate. We did quite well in the PDA portion of the Smartphones. We just didn't do that well, with a couple of notable exceptions, in the generic Smartphone, mostly because the generic Smartphone business did not take off as a percent of the market. The cell phone market is still very much low-end driven in terms of unit growth. 
As we begin to evaluate our opportunity to participate in broader segments of that market going forward, we just did not see numbers that gave us a reasonable return on incremental investment going forward, hence the decision. 
On the other hand, as we talked about in the analyst day, we are very, very excited about mobile PCs and low-power Intel architecture moving into these things and having computers get smaller with the communication capability. That is where we are putting our energy at this point in time. 
Adam Parker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. 
Was it pure coincidence that the same $600 million was the amount you invested in WiMAX the very next week? 
Paul Otellini
It's pure coincidence. 
Adam Parker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. 
All right. On the surface, you can say well, we did a ten-year MPV here that suggests this is going to be much better than we thought… 
Paul Otellini
Two ships passing in the night and they happen to be the same number when they passed. 
Adam Parker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. 
All right. Thank you for your time. 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung with Citigroup. Please proceed. 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
Thanks. Andy, when I look at your gross margin forecast for the year, I think I am reading it right that it is 51% for the year. If that is right, it implies that fourth quarter gross margins will actually be below third quarter gross margins. I want to make sure I am understanding that correctly. 
Andy Bryant
I am not making a fourth quarter gross margin forecast right now. What you have to recognize is the full year has three years of baggage behind it -- three quarters of actual behind it. So if you look at that fourth quarter, you are going to find you have a wide range of outcomes that still leads to a midpoint of 51%, plus or minus a few. So do not overanalyze it at this point. Do what you think makes sense. 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
I.E., if revenues are up and utilization is up, in theory, you should be up? 
Andy Bryant
I believe cost per unit should get better in the fourth quarter. I believe the new products will be a higher percentage of our revenue in the fourth quarter, so there are some reasonably positive things out there. Again, let me wait a quarter before I give you a fourth quarter margin estimate. 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
Okay, fair enough. I wanted to ask also some questions on the pricing trends for the third quarter, recognizing that you guys are making some changes. Most notably in notebook, because there are not any sort of specific changes that you are making for notebook. If I am understanding that correctly, you actually cut prices on notebook in March, and now your refresh in the third quarter actually comes back to the old ladder. How should we think about notebook pricing in terms of across the board for the third quarter? 
Paul Otellini
The difference in the degree of reset of the price stack in desktop and notebooks reflects the strength we have in the notebook business. We are the performance leader, the volume leader by far there. We have designed the new products to come in and sit on top of the other ones, and yet we are driving dual-core farther and farther down the stack, particularly as it becomes appealing into consumer notebooks. It really reflects the competitive strength of the product line more than anything else. 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
That makes sense. If we think about just the desktop part of it, you guys seem to be putting the single core chips on fire sale for Q3, fine because that is going to end of life at some point. With the dual-core processors only, is there a strategy here for you guys in trying to move the mix? Are you trying to get us to buy more high-end in the dual-core markets starting in Q3? 
Paul Otellini
Heck, yes. Wouldn't you? 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
Yeah. 
Paul Otellini
That is always Intel's strategy to try and sell the richest mix possible. The thing that we are really focused on right now though, given that we have dual-core running on a number of new microprocessors and older ones, is really the penetration of dual-core, and making that much more pervasive in desktops in all segments. 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
I am sorry, did you say what you thought dual-core was going to be as a percentage of desktop sales in Q3? 
Paul Otellini
No, but I showed you Q3 -- I showed you a line through year end at the analyst meeting, and if anything, it has gotten a little bit richer than that. 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
Okay, that is good to know. All right. Thanks a lot. 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs 
Thanks very much. Question on the margins for Q3, and then the sort of implied margins for Q4. Is all of the weakness in margins in Q3 ASP related, or are there other factors going on? 
Andy Bryant
No, I think we will have a richer mix of dual-core, the early dual-core products, which means the cost of units will go up. In fact, I would guess cost is a bigger element than average selling price. 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs 
Then, relative to Q4, to Glen's point, there are scenarios that Q4 is down again. If it was cost in Q3, wouldn't that improve as we went through to Q4? 
Andy Bryant
Yes, I believe my cost units should improve in Q4 versus Q3. I believe the number of units shipped out of the new architecture products will be greater in Q4 versus Q3. I think I have a few good things happening in the fourth quarter for us. 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs 
Again then, and I do not want to push it too much, but the margins are theoretically down for both quarters. If there's positive things going on, why isn't that showing up in the margins then? 
Andy Bryant
Again, if you do the math with three quarters of actual at our midpoint and look at what the range of Q4 could be to still round to unit 51, I think you will see a wide range of possible outcomes. 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs 
Sure, I don’t want to get wrapped up in semantics, but it is not up in conjunction -- if revenue is going to up 10%, you would think margins would be better than flat to up slightly. Yes, there are scenarios mathematically that the margins are up, but there are scenarios down too. Just trying to get a handle on why the margins wouldn't be up consistent with the revenues. 
Andy Bryant
Okay. I do not know how many times I can say I am not giving a Q4 forecast. There is a wide range of outcomes. I agree there's no 10-point up margins outcome. 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs 
Okay. I guess we'll have to deal with that. On the inventory, what would it take for the company to do an inventory write-off? Under what scenario would you decide to write off some of the inventory? 
Andy Bryant
I want to be clear -- we always have some inventory write-offs. If you are asking an extraordinary inventory write-off? 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs 
Yes. 
Andy Bryant
It would take most likely a big change in demand. If suddenly demand dropped 10% or 15% and we decided to push all the new products and stop selling any of the single-core stuff, then we would take an inventory write-off. 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs 
To be clear, a change in demand relative to normal seasonality? Because clearly demand is just okay now. 
Andy Bryant
Change in demand from our expectations. 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs 
Okay. 
Andy Bryant
Again, I know we are in very different spaces on this. I have the equivalent of one month worth of cost of sales in my inventory -- one quarter's worth of cost of sales in my inventory. I would typically value a whole lot more than one quarters worth of inventory looking out into the future. It would take a pretty dramatic change to cause us to have a big inventory write-off. 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs 
Terrific, thank you. 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Chris with JP Morgan Chase. Please proceed. 
Chris Danely - JP Morgan
Thanks, guys. Just a follow-up on some of the gross margin stuff. Andy, it sounds like inventory's up a little this quarter and then down a little in Q4. Perhaps you want to take inventory down in the first half of next year. It seems as though depreciation should increase -- to make a short story long, should we expect gross margins to bottom in the second half of this year or the first half of next year? 
Andy Bryant
Again, I am not making long-term gross margin forecasts. What I really believe is we have shown a cost-per-unit of microprocessors chart at the analyst meeting and what it showed was the highest point on cost-per-unit for microprocessors, I expect to be the third quarter. Then I expect to see period by period by period by period improvements. 
Now, there are other products that we sell as well. We sell flash, we sell motherboards, we sell chipsets, so it is not as clean as looking at that one chart and saying I can forecast Intel's margins. But microprocessors are clearly the biggest part of our revenue. I actually see our cost units improving quarter by quarter by quarter through next year. 
Chris Danely - JP Morgan
Okay. Just to follow with that, Paul, you said you want to keep the fabs full. Have you guys lowered utilization rates at all, or do you plan on lowering utilization rates? 
Paul Otellini
I'm sorry, factory utilization rates, is that what you are asking? 
Chris Danely - JP Morgan
 Yes. Have they been lowered, or do you plan on lowering them? 
Paul Otellini
No, the factories are still operating, for the most part, at full capacity. 
Chris Danely - JP Morgan
Okay. So let's just say sales are a little bit lower than expected this quarter, you… 
Paul Otellini
Then we might have to -- then one of the options we have is to take down wafer starts a bit, but right now, none of our projections show that. 
Chris Danely - JP Morgan
I guess I am just wondering, given what has happened the last couple of quarters, why aren't you guys a little more conservative on your guidance and inventory? 
Andy Bryant
You mean why aren’t we forecasting it to grow more? 
Chris Danely - JP Morgan
I mean why forecast normal revenue growth and inventory going up, given what happened the last couple of quarters? 
Paul Otellini
Because the fourth quarter is bigger than the third quarter in terms of shipments. You want to -- we need to be able to support that growth. It's still a seasonal year, and then first quarter, things drop off. 
Chris Danely - JP Morgan
Yes, I understand that, it's just us analysts remember what happened in 2004, so that's why we are all pretty nervous. Okay, thanks guys. 
Alex Lenke
Operator, two more questions, please. 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Eric Gomberg with Thomas Weisel Partners. Please proceed. 
Eric Gomberg - Thomas Weisel Partners
I was wondering if you could give anymore color, given the early qualification of some of the processors, where you would expect to be, either by the end of 3Q or year end in terms of Woodcrest, Conroe and Merom as percent of processors? Also, do you have any concern regarding being able to ship enough Conroe, given how good the reviews have been? Will you be able to meet all the OEM demand? 
Paul Otellini
I showed a number in April at the analyst meeting on Woodcrest that said that we would, in terms of the percent of our Xeon products that were Woodcrest-based, it would be 75% by Q4. I think it was 50% in Q3, or whatever the number was. Those numbers have only gotten a little bit better since then. They have not gotten worse. Obviously the denominator is still at risk, but we're ramping Woodcrest as fast as possible, and our intent is to convert the product line. 
Similarly on Conroe and Merom. Right now, we have rolled up demand from our customers and from the channel and we believe we can satisfy all demand for both those products. 
Eric Gomberg - Thomas Weisel Partners
If I could just ask a follow-up, as you go through the strategic review, this is something you have been asked probably many times over the last few years, can you talk a little bit about the NOR flash business and why that remains a strategic and compelling business for Intel to be in, at $250 million operating loss in the first half? 
Paul Otellini
Our focus on that business is to not have that kind of operating loss going forward, so we are going through a similar rigorous process inside of the NOR business. You have already seen one action that came out of that, about six weeks ago where we rolled, for the first time ever we broke out the manufacturing and technology development groups for flash from the rest of the company and put them under the flash group. 
We have already seen some pretty interesting ideas, the beginnings of some efficiencies rolling out of that as they learn how to be much more competitive with their peer group companies in the flash marketplace. 
My focus inside the company is to make sure that business gets to be a profitable one as quickly as possible. 
Andy Bryant
I just want to clarify something. The losses you see in that business are not just the NOR flash. We are starting up the NAND flash business. Recognize in that business you have factories starting up pre-volume production, so you have pretty high start-up costs, you have pretty high R&D costs. A big portion of the increase in loss of the net business is that start-up, which we hope to turn profitable sometime in the near future. 
Eric Gomberg - Thomas Weisel Partners
Could you give any color in terms of what you would expect NAND contribution to be in the back half of the year? 
Andy Bryant
In terms of revenue, no. It is still relatively small at this point, starting to finally ramp in the back half of this year as it is being set up in the front half. Hopefully next year will be meaningful enough we can talk about it. 
Eric Gomberg - Thomas Weisel Partners
Thank you. 
Alex Lenke
Last question, please. 
Operator
Your last question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Moors & Cabot, Inc. Please proceed. 
Hans Mosesmann - Moors & Cabot, Inc.
Thank you. Paul, you mentioned that the rolled up demand from customers suggests that you could satisfy all of this demand. Can you satisfy it at launch? I just want to get a sense of how… 
Paul Otellini
Yes. In fact, at launch you will even see Conroe stocked in the channel. 
Hans Mosesmann - Moors & Cabot, Inc.
Okay, so both OEMs and channel will have product then? 
Paul Otellini
Yes, sir, and we have motherboards out there staged and so forth. This one is being done as broadly as we know how to do it. 
Hans Mosesmann - Moors & Cabot, Inc.
Okay, and then a follow-up. In terms of previous launches, how quick of a ramp pervasiveness did you see with this… 
Paul Otellini
It is faster than the NetBurst. 
Hans Mosesmann - Moors & Cabot, Inc.
Faster than NetBurst? 
Paul Otellini
Much faster. 
Hans Mosesmann - Moors & Cabot, Inc.

Thanks, Doug. I will keep my comments brief and then turn it over for Andy for more detail on our results for the first quarter and our outlook for the second quarter and the year. Revenue for the first quarter met our revised expectations set in March, but was well below our normal seasonal levels. Microprocessor ASPs were down slightly and unit market segment share was flat. 
We believe that while the computing market segment remains healthy overall, PC growth rates have moderated somewhat from the double-digit levels seen over the past several years. As a result, overall microprocessor inventories at our customers, while declining in Q1, remain several million units higher than their current inventory goals. The reduction of this inventory to normal levels will limit our revenue expectations for the current quarter. 
Our view of the end markets and overall economic conditions leads us to believe we will see continued improvements in customer inventory levels in the second quarter and allow us to return to our normal seasonal patterns for our business in the second half of this year. 
We are reducing our spending outlook for 2006 by $1 billion and will continue to closely monitor our inventory and production levels. At this time, we are not making any significant adjustments in our production levels or plans for the year. 
Moving to the product and technology side of our business, I'll briefly highlight our progress and plans to put Intel in an excellent competitive position as we approach the seasonally stronger second half. Our 65 nanometer process technology is ramping and yielding on target and we are now in production at all three of our 300-millimeter, 65 nanometer facilities. In fact, microprocessor wafer starts on 65 nanometer are crossing above those on 90 nanometer this month. 
We shipped over 5 million 65 nanometer dual-core microprocessors in the first quarter into the desktop, notebook, and server segments, including the first deliveries of Dempsey and the new Blackford server chipset. 
The Centrino Duo mobile platform went from launch in January to very high volume exiting the quarter with mobile continuing to generate strong year-over-year growth. We also launched the new Viiv platform for the digital home and are on track to ship more Viiv platforms this is year than Centrino platforms in its first year in the market. We are now beginning to convert our 90 nanometer factories to chipsets like Broadwater that enable new second-half platforms for the digital office and the home. 
Looking forward on our 65 nanometer technology, we are particularly pleased with the production readiness of upcoming processors based upon Intel's new core micro architecture, which gives us industry-leading, energy efficient performance across the desktop, notebook, and two-way server segments. We plan to ship Woodcrest, Conroe and Merom in volume during Q3. We will say more about these new platforms at our spring analyst meeting in New York next week. 
Our flash memory partnership with Micron is going quite well. Intel delivered the first NAND units for Apple's iPods and shipped our millionth unit only six weeks after production began from the IM flash technology venture. We also produced 65 nanometer NOR flash memories and 45 nanometer SRAM memories, demonstrating Intel's ongoing leadership in silicon process technology. 
In summary, the first half of 2006 is a time to reset our business. We are working with our customers and the channel to better ensure that inventory returns to more appropriate levels while transitioning to new products for the second half of 2006. We are adjusting our spending in line with reduced revenue outlook, but not changing the ramp profile of our new factories and product lines. 
At the same time as we are making these adjustments for 2006, we are undertaking a comprehensive analysis of our Company with the goal of significantly increasing our overall efficiency in 2007 and beyond. Our process technology and factory performance remain excellent and we are preparing to roll out our most competitive and compelling product line in years. With that, I'll turn the call over to Andy. 
Andy Bryant
Thanks, Paul. As Paul stated, we have begun the year competing for orders and holding share, adapting to lower expectations for the overall year by trimming spending and continuing to push forward to ensure we have new products to support a stronger second half. 
Revenue for the first quarter was $8.9 billion, down over 12% from the fourth quarter. Most of the change in revenue came from lower unit volumes in microprocessors and chipsets, concentrated in the desktop and server segments. 
Among the geographies, the changes in revenue were unusual for the first quarter. In the Europe region revenue decreased 26% and in Asia Pacific, revenue was down 16%; both geos substantially lower than typical seasonality. The Americas region grew 4%. Japan was up 10%, and achieved its first $1 billion quarter. In a year-to-year comparison, revenue was down approximately $500 million or 5%. 
Revenue in the digital enterprise group was down 19% from a year ago, while the mobility group grew 22%. Among the geographies, most of the decrease was in the greater Europe region where revenue was down 19%. 
The first quarter of 2005 was 14 weeks compared to 13 weeks in the recent quarter. 
Gross margin of $4.9 billion, including share-based compensation of $86 million, were down 22% from the fourth quarter. Gross margin percentage was 55.1% on a GAAP basis. Without share-based compensation of about 1 point, gross margin percentage was 56.1% down 5.7 points from the fourth quarter, due to lower revenue from logic products, a consequent change in overall product mix, and higher reserves and write-downs of logic products. 
In January, our quarterly forecast for growth margin percentage was 59%, plus or minus a few points. The difference of 3.9 points between the midpoint of the forecast and actual results was a function of lower microprocessor unit volume and a consequent change in overall product mix and higher write-downs of inventory. 
In a year-to-year comparison, gross margin percentage, excluding share-based compensation, is approximately 4 points lower than the first quarter of 2005, primarily as a result of lower revenue offset somewhat by lower start-up costs. 
Spending, R&D and MG&A, was $3.2 billion, slightly below our forecast in January. Excluding share-based compensation of approximately $300 million, spending decreased approximately 2% from the fourth quarter and is up more than 15% from a year ago. Despite the cuts, spending has grown as a percentage of revenue and there is much work yet to be done. 
Now to non-operating items. The effective tax rate in the first quarter was 27.5%, lower than our January forecast of approximately 32% as a result of higher concentration of profits in lower tax jurisdictions and tax credits. The change added approximately $0.014 to EPS. 
Fully diluted EPS were $0.23. Excluding share-based compensation, EPS would have been $0.27. Quarterly average shares outstanding are down nearly 6% from a year ago and fell below 6 billion for the first time in more than 10 years. 
On the balance sheet, inventories of $3.6 billion were up over $400 million from the fourth quarter as we ramped production of microprocessors on a 65 nanometer process and produced associated chipsets. The increase in the first quarter includes approximately $85 million of capitalized share-based compensation. 
Capacity utilization on the 65 and 90 nanometer processes is high and we expect to continue to build inventories in the second quarter. 
We substantially reduced total cash investments comprised of cash, short-term investments, and fixed income trading assets, ending the quarter at $8.7 billion, down by $3.7 billion from the fourth quarter. 
Other long-term assets increased by $1.7 billion, largely as a result of investments in IM flash technology. Stock repurchases were $2.9 billion, capital spending was $1.8 billion, and dividend payments were nearly $600 million. We expect to reduce the level of our stock repurchases over the coming quarters to less than half of the first quarter rate as we continue to manage our cash flow. 
As we turn now to the outlook for the second quarter, please keep in mind that the forecast data does not include the effect of any new acquisitions, divestitures, or similar transactions that may be completed after April 18. I will use the midpoint of forecast ranges when making comparisons to specific periods. 
We are planning for revenue in the second quarter to be between $8 billion and $8.6 billion, a sequential decrease of approximately 7%. That is a higher decline than we would typically see for this period. This forecast assumes lower unit volume in logic products as customers work through inventories. The projected year-to-year decrease of 10% anticipates lower unit volume and prices of microprocessors. 
Our expectation for gross margin percentage in the second quarter is 49% plus or minus a couple points. Without share-based compensation of approximately 1 point of margin, the forecast gross margin percentage is 50% plus or minus a couple points. Lower revenue for microprocessors and a consequent change in overall product mix will lower gross margin for the first quarter as will higher microprocessor unit costs as we ramp production of the dual core products. 
Spending, R&D plus MG&A, should be approximately $3 billion to $3.1 billion. The forecast includes approximately $300 million of share-based compensation. Without the impact of these charges, spending should be between $2.7 billion and $2.8 billion, down approximately 6% from the comparable number in the first quarter. 
Looking ahead to the full year, we have revised our January forecast for revenue growth of 6% to 9% from 2005 and are now planning for the revenue to be down approximately 3% primarily as a result of lower unit volumes. This forecast is subject to a wide range of potential variability. 
For the second half, the forecast assumes seasonal revenue growth and gains in market segment share. We believe Intel's revenue in the second quarter will be several hundred million dollars lower than PC consumption rates would typically suggest and we are planning for a second half growth that is seasonal off of our first half base adjusted for this difference. 
We expect gross margin percentage for the year to be 53% plus or minus a few points. Without share-based compensation of approximately 1 point of margin the forecast is 54% plus or minus a few points, down more than 5 points from gross margin in 2005. Lower start-up costs and manufacturing will help 2006 margins but this will be more than offset by higher unit costs for logic products and slightly lower average selling prices for microprocessors. 
As a result of several cost-saving actions we have lowered the forecast for R&D and capital spending for the year. The forecast for R&D is now about $400 million lower at approximately $6.1 billion. Without share-based compensation of approximately $500 million, the forecast for R&D spending is approximately $5.6 billion. 
Capital spending forecast is now $300 million lower at $6.6 billion plus or minus $200 million. Cost-saving actions have also lowered the forecast for total spending for the year, including not only R&D, but also marketing and G&A by over $1 billion. The current forecast of approximately $12.1 billion includes the impact of share-based compensation of $1.1 billion. Excluding this impact, total spending is forecasted as $11 billion, essentially flat with 2005. This includes spending for the IM flash technology joint venture. 
The estimated tax rate for the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2006 is approximately 30.5%, lower than the previous estimate of 32%. 
In summary, this is a year for resolute determination. We are determined to compete now, determined to deliver better products with superior manufacturing capabilities, and determined to control spending. This will require disciplined, methodical focus, but we believe that with Intel's products and manufacturing capabilities, we are more than up to the task. With that, let me turn it over to Doug. 
Doug Lusk
Thanks, Andy. We will now open the conference call for Q&A. We will attempt to take questions from as many participants as possible. To help in this process, we ask that you please limit yourselves to only one question and no more than one brief follow-up. Thank you. 
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you very much, sir. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Glen Yeung from Citigroup. 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
Maybe just a point of clarification; I'll say it the way I think I heard it and then you tell me if I'm wrong. You're basically saying that your second quarter guidance for revenues is being impacted by inventories. If I were to normalize that for normal seasonality and then grow Q3 and Q4 out for normal seasonality, I get you're down 3% for the year. Is that the right interpretation? 
Andy Bryant
Essentially so. We also think there's some share gain in the back half of the year because of the better product lineup. But the bulk of it is adjusting the second quarter to the consumption levels and then doing seasonal Q3 and Q4. 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
What gives you the confidence about the ability for the supply chain to clean up the inventory situation in the second quarter? And then oddly enough, what then gives you confidence that we're actually looking at a seasonal year when you guys have said that the end market may not be as strong? 
Andy Bryant
Well, two things in there. First, as far as confidence in cleaning up the supply chain, when you look at the extra few million units that we think are out there, that equates to one to two weeks of inventory, no more than that. There's a fairly high turnover among our customers. It's pretty easy to moderate our shipments into our customers, in cooperation with them, of course, to get anywhere between 3 and 4 million units of inventory burned off through a quarter. That is just careful, disciplined planning. 
As far as expectation for the second half, yes, we do believe the growth rate of PCs for the year moderated. Last time we talked to you, we believed low double digits, 10% to 12%. Now, if you look at most of the market forecasters, they'll tell you high single digits, 7% to 9% which we think is consistent. We also think that's a baseline that's in the second quarter. So I'm not counting on an increasing growth rate in the back half of the year consumption, I'm counting on a growth rate consistent with what people generally think today. 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
As you look into the second half, we see this revenue ramp and then we look at what you got it for in terms of gross margins, which also implies a reasonably significant ramp of margins in the second half, are we really just seeing the margins track where revenues are? Or are there other things that Intel is doing specifically to manage margins higher in the second half? Just any clarity you can provide on the details. 
Andy Bryant
Sure. I'll try to give a little more detail now about Q2 which hopefully will help later on because I think the question will come. So in the second quarter I'm saying the midpoint of my margin percentage expectation is down 6 points. If you look at that, it's a combination of things. The biggest factor is the fact that most of the revenue drop comes in high margin microprocessor-type products. So even though my microprocessor product mix stays about the same, because my other lower margin products don't drop, you see a mix change. Of my 6 point drop, that's about half of it. 
So in the third quarter when microprocessor returns to normal because the inventory correction has been adjusted for, you'll see a pretty good kick just because you get that mix improvement back. I'd like to see more progress in the back half of the year. One of the things I'll show you next week is I'll show you costs of microprocessors. 
The second biggest element in my margins going down in the second quarter is my cost per unit as we ramp the dual-core hard. Remember, as I get in the third and fourth quarter I'm getting the new dual-core products, I'm getting smaller die so we'll start seeing some benefits from the cost per units out there. It takes a bit to get to, but it's going to help in that place, as well. So I think I got a couple things going for me that should help me in the back half of the year. 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup
Great, thanks a lot.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Masdea of Credit Suisse. 
Michael Masdea - Credit Suisse
I guess what's interesting is the last few quarters we've seen your competitor seemed to outgrow you but market share loss hasn't been something in your vocabulary. Is there some math that we're doing wrong? What gives you the confidence that there's not more share loss going on, that we've seen the last few quarters and it's not going to continue? 
Andy Bryant
It's simple. When we talked to you in January, it was before we saw our competitors' shipment data. When you looked at it, it clearly said in the fourth quarter of last year we lost more market segment share than we thought we did. I think we probably lost a little more in the third quarter than we thought we did as well. 
If you look at the fourth quarter, again, we've seen their unit shipments, we know what our unit shipments are. On a unit shipment basis, we held -- in the first quarter, I mean. So we've seen that. There could be some adjustment in the second quarter again, as I clean up my inventory. I don't know what their position is so I can't really tell you yet how the points will move back and forth. The first quarter was a noticeable change from what we saw in the back half of '05. 
Michael Masdea - Credit Suisse
Does that imply that your ASPs were down in the ballpark of 5% to 8%, somewhere in that range? It seems like their unit market share wasn't down quite as much. Their units weren't down as much as yours were. 
Andy Bryant
ASPs only dropped slightly which wouldn't be quite that much to be honest. 
Michael Masdea - Credit Suisse
I'll work on the math. The other question is on that second-half ramp, the math I'm getting is a little bit different, too. It looks like you have almost about $1.2 billion to make up in the second half and it sounds like you're saying $300 million or $400 million is more the right ballpark in terms of revenue. When you start to think about the delta of seasonality versus what you need to do, is that the right ballpark or am I missing something? 
Andy Bryant
Again, if you take Q2 as we've given you an estimate, start with Q1 and a normal seasonal drop is somewhere in the 2% to 3% range. So take your Q2 baseline down 2% to 3% from Q1 and then add your normal seasonality in Q3 and Q4. It doesn't quite account for all of the revenue because we do expect to take some share in the second half of the year. 
Michael Masdea - Credit Suisse
It might be worth just to remind us what your view of seasonality is for each quarter just so we'll make sure we're all using the same math. Thanks a lot. 
Andy Bryant
Historical seasonality in the third quarter has been 7%, 8%. In the fourth quarter, it was a little bit better than that. 
Michael Masdea - Credit Suisse
Thanks a lot. 
Operator
Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, our next question comes from the line of Adam Parker of Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed. 
Adam Parker - Sanford Bernstein
The inventory reserves during the quarter, how much more will you take in Q2 and Q3 and how do you expect that to impact your margins in the coming quarters, please? 
Andy Bryant
Sure. There were some inventory reserves in the first quarter, Adam, not a big number. So if I were trying to explain the 6 point margin drop versus the prior quarter, reserves were a small portion of it. Essentially some of the older product that we think as we ramp the new products, we won't end up selling. Same thing in Q2; it's a pretty small number, that inventory reserve calculation effect. 
Adam Parker - Sanford Bernstein
Paul, just a question for you. You referenced I think, you said it quickly so I didn't catch it, sort of a plan to improving efficiencies in 2007 and beyond. I was wondering if you'd comment more on this. Should we see some head count reductions? Obviously headcount grew again here, or some structurally lower capital R&D intensity? Or what are you referencing with that improved efficiency, please? 
Paul Otellini
Well, first of all, I think it's a bit premature to give you any specifics. We're just undertaking a look at the Company now in a fairly comprehensive fashion. The idea would be to look at every aspect of our operations from capital efficiency to our facilities to our resourcing to our various business units to underperforming businesses, et cetera. This is a wholesale look at the Company over the next couple of months; to take a look at where we want to be for '07 and beyond. 
At the same time we're doing that, we're taking the other actions we've talked about in terms of trimming the spending for this year, but not taking our eye off the ball and getting the new products out. That is the most important thing for us at this point. 
Adam Parker - Sanford Bernstein
So you'll give some more color on that in the future, is what you're saying? 
Paul Otellini
As soon as we get some, yes. 
Andy Bryant
To reinforce what Paul said, we took the forecasted spending for the year down $1 billion. It had nothing to do with that, it's old-fashioned let's go cut some spending. I'm hoping that by the end of the year we're starting to see some results from this program and I can actually get a little below $11 billion. 
Adam Parker - Sanford Bernstein
Paul, this is the first time in how many years you've undertaken this sort of thorough analysis? Ever? 
Paul Otellini
It's probably the first time since the mid '80s. 
Adam Parker - Sanford Bernstein
Cool, all right. Thanks. 
Operator
Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava of Harris Nesbitt. 
Ambrish Srivastava - Harris Nesbitt
Hi, Andy. Just a clarification. I don't get it, so please help me understand this. Your customers have excess inventory, you build inventory again. You are alluding to some minimal reserves next quarter, but yet you're going to be building inventory. What areas do you think you'll be building inventory in and what is the risk that there won't be another larger write down in the second quarter? Thanks. 
Andy Bryant
There is some risk. I don't want to tell you there's none. Remember what Paul said, though, about the way we're using our factory right now. The 65 nanometer is building the new microprocessors that are going to be shipped in the back half. I don't want to slow those down. I think that's our future. The 90 nanometers transitioning into the chipsets, the Broadwater chipsets, are being used heavily there when again is our future. So we're building the products, we're certain are going to be there for the future. 
Some of the stuff in the line today is some of the older products that have to be there in case you have a product slip or something happens and you need to ship product. So there is some risk that in a transition, you build a bit of a bubble and you don't need to ship that stuff. It's a small risk. There are lots of places in this world you ship some product -- essentially as good as most people's in the world. So there's, the task for us is to find places to put those. 
As I said earlier, we did take modest reserves -- and by modest, it's believe me, it's not a big number -- in the first quarter because there were some products I looked at and said it's likely these won't be shippable. If demand slowed down and we had a choice between still shipping the old or the new, we'll ship the new. So if you saw another step down in demand it might become an issue. If demand, if the market grows in the high single digits, you won't see much change to the reserve portion. 
Ambrish Srivastava - Harris Nesbitt
Andy just so that we're clear, modest means what? Tens of millions of dollars? $100 million? 
Andy Bryant
Modest means under $100 million. We have $3.6 million in inventory, we're talking -- modest is under $100 million. 
Ambrish Srivastava - Harris Nesbitt
One last question and I'll go. On the cost side, is the increase in cost that you are anticipating in the next quarter, is that what you would typically expect when you ramp a lower geometric product or is that something atypical that you're experiencing? 
Andy Bryant
This is atypical. We're ramping the current larger die dual-core product because we have the capacity to, it's a higher performing product and we think we can take advantage of it. As a result of that, the cost will be higher than I expected, in fact, higher than I expected as little as six months ago. 
What I've got to do is get to the new products which take advantage of the new manufacturing and were designed to be a more cost efficient package. Those are in production today. They'll be shipping in Q3 and Q4, so I basically will have at three to five-month period where I have a heavy concentration of the larger die product. 
Ambrish Srivastava - Harris Nesbitt
Okay. Thank you. 
Operator
Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Charlie Glavin of Needham and Company. 
Charlie Glavin - Needham and Company
Thanks. Paul or Andy, in terms of the back half of the year, what gives you the conviction in terms of having the mix right? Paul, there's certainly a fair number of new products -- Woodcrest, Conroe, Merom -- which have been getting good reception, but if I take a look, you've already got about 13 new brands not including the Viiv. 
Andy, I recall you having previously said you can get the absolute numbers right, but the mix always scares you. Given that you're really counting on probably the strongest second half you've had since 1996, where can we get the conviction that you got the mix right? 
Paul Otellini
Well, we will build our newest, best products most and fastest. So we will load the 65 nanometer factories as fast as they're possible to ramp, with Woodcrest, Conroe, and Merom. We'll backfill that, because there is a natural ramp on new products and yield and so forth. We'll backfill that with the existing 65 nanometer products, which are the core-based products, Core Duo product and the Prestor product that goes out today and Dempsey and servers. 
Since we'll load from the top, my conviction goes up a much higher in terms of mix predictability. Viiv, if you talk about brands, Centrino and Viiv and the upcoming brand associated with the business desktop that we'll talk about on Monday, those all will take advantage of a variety of microprocessors, but generally speaking all 65 nanometers. 
Charlie Glavin - Needham and Company
In terms of the current excess, if I back out the numbers, it looks like about $450 million in excess right now in terms of Q2. What is the general mix of that? Is it more lower-end product, are we talking about a combination of both servers and desktops? Could you give a little bit more granularity, particularly given the geographic or the diversity of the geographic strength in Q1? 
Andy Bryant
Again, it's somewhat speculation because you don't get inventory reporting from your customers by part and by speed. My guess is it's pretty much a general mix of what we sell. So I don't think there's anything unique out there. Again, remember we're talking about between one and two weeks, we're not talking about six or eight weeks worth of parts of anything. 
Charlie Glavin - Needham and Company
1 million to 2 million? 
Andy Bryant
One to two weeks. 
Charlie Glavin - Needham and Company
Several million. 
Andy Bryant
Several million, which is one to two weeks' worth of consumption. 
Charlie Glavin - Needham and Company
Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Cody Acree of Stifel Nicolaus. 
Cody Acree - Stifel Nicolaus
Thanks. Andy, in this quarter a lot's been made of the pricing competition in your efforts to clean out the channel. Can you talk about your pricing strategy? Sounds like your ASPs are only down just moderately this quarter. I guess there seems to be a little disconnect. How does the pricing strategy change in the second half with the new products? 
Paul Otellini
Let me address the question, second half first. The new products that will come in right on top of our existing price points and then ramp very quickly from there down. So they tend to replace the existing dual-core products at the high end. They have new SKUs, new in splits on top of our product line, and new feature sets. So that one is pretty easy. 
In terms of the pricing actions we've taken in the first quarter and looking at Q2 and Q3, they tend to be more aggressive towards the bottom of the market, particularly on desktops. I think that's one of the reasons you're seeing a bit of a glut in the channel today, not at our distributors because the inventory there is in relatively good shape, but in the grey market and that's up to distributors and brokers. You tend to see a bit of a discount for most microprocessors of all flavors, of all brands in the channel right now. 
Cody Acree - Stifel Nicolaus
Paul, if I may follow up there. You talked about the market share stabilizing here in the first quarter, basically with the same product portfolio that caused some of the market share losses in the second half. Is it a more aggressive pricing strategy that caused that stabilization or is there something else going on there? 
Paul Otellini
Well, the fact that ASPs were down only slightly says it wasn't a radical change in pricing. There were some line items that had fairly significant moves, particularly at the bottom of the stack. But we also did a good job selling our high end products this quarter, particularly in notebooks as the Core Duo ramped. So the number that we talked about in my comments was a blended number. 
Cody Acree - Stifel Nicolaus
All right. Thank you. 
Operator
Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of John Lau of Jefferies. 
John Lau - Jefferies
Great. Following along the lines of the pricing question, there has been a lot of concern on the pricing action and you did mention that the blended price, didn't go down that much, which means you did a very good job in terms of offsetting that with the high end. As you look into Q2, what are your expectations with regards to that blend again, given that you were quite aggressive in the low end? Thank you. 
Andy Bryant
As I've slowly, a piece at a time, given the gross margin reconciliation, about half of the decline in Q1 and Q2 is because of revenue drop. The next biggest element was unit cost for microprocessors, the dual-core ramp. The next one would be an ASP decline. So I do expect again a modest decline. But recognize it's not a big number. It's again, it's relatively modest. 
John Lau - Jefferies
As a follow-up, you did mention something that was quite interesting. Europe was down so much. What do you attribute that to? Is there anything that was regional or anything out of the ordinary that would cause such a precipitous drop? Thank you. 
Paul Otellini
It seems like in general, both the consumer and the enterprise business was soft in Europe. We're seeing that. We've seen that from comments from a number of the computer manufacturers now as they've discussed the environment in Q1. I think that it was equal as well between notebooks and desktops. I didn't see that one was stronger than the other. So we just saw a very soft quarter in Europe and as I said, that was one of the reasons we saw inventory stacking up at our OEM customers. 
John Lau - Jefferies
Great, thank you. 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello of Goldman Sachs. 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs
Good evening, thanks very much. Guys can I just ask a philosophical question first? Coming off two quarters where you missed numbers and the environment is choppy, why not set a lower bar for yourself for the second half of the year? Everybody knows the business is pretty choppy right now. Why be so aggressive? 
Andy Bryant
Sure, I'll be happy to take that one. We have a philosophy that says we communicate to the general public what we actually believe is going to happen. We don't lowball, we don't take aggressive numbers. We think that's what's expected of us by the SEC. It's certainly what we do. So I realize that means I'm going to miss an occasional number. But it seems to be the high integrity way to do it. 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs
On a more fundamental basis, on the CapEx cut can you give us some color on where the CapEx is coming from? Usually you give us some indication in the analyst meeting here in the spring on the forward-looking CapEx and what you think that might look like. You've talked before about just how a little bit of overage on the capacity can cause a pretty big hit at the margins. 
A final piece to that question is, you're spending at $1.8 billion a quarter on CapEx and depreciating a little over $1.1 billion a quarter. How much is the depreciation going to ramp here over the next couple of quarters, which would cut into any the margin ramp? Thanks very much and sorry for all the questions. 
Andy Bryant
Boy, a lot of questions in there. On the depreciation question, we've given a full year depreciation, you can pretty much draw a straight line between Q1, Q2, and the full year. There's no right turns in there. It will just be a gradual ramp. 
In terms of the capital spending, there's no big place that we cut. As Paul said we're protecting the 45 nanometer ramp, we're protecting the 65 nanometer. What you're really seeing is cuts around the edges. You're seeing, if I was going to build a building someplace, maybe I'll not do that. Maybe I'll do a little more compression. Some engineering tools. So it's not a big cut. It's not in any particular place where you try to protect capacity and then look at all the things beyond capacity and see if we could save some money. 
We'll talk next week about the capital efficiency. I don't intend that to be a signaling device for next year's capital. But I understand if you do math, you can start to triangulate where you think we're headed. I'll save that for next week. 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs

Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of David Wu of Global Crown Capital. 
David Wu - Global Crown Capital
Can you clarify one thing? Historically, when PC OEMs or channel partners get into trouble with excess inventory, they were very, very quick to get rid of it. From the stuff that you get out of Taiwan, it looks like the European slowdown really hit in January and February. By March, things were more or less getting back to normal. Why do you think it will take the whole second quarter to get rid of that excess inventory which you admitted was one or two weeks? 
Paul Otellini
Yes. Well, I mean, it is still several million units and we factored that into the numbers, David, relative to normal seasonality between Q1 and Q2. So we looked at what normal seasonality would be. At this point, we have a fairly good view, at least with our largest customers in terms of exactly how much product they need for calendar Q2. Those orders reflect their view of consumption, assuming that they drive their inventories down. 
As our collective view on the size of the market in 2006 changed over the last few months, they've also reduced their view going forward and reduced their inventory levels. 
Part of this, I think, is also trying to kind of clear the decks for our new products coming out in Q3. No one really wants to be on the wrong side of that inventory conversion. So the combination of those, I think, leads us to a fairly high confidence that the inventory will come down this quarter as we're projecting. 
David Wu - Global Crown Capital
Okay. Thank you. 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Edelstone of Morgan Stanley. 
Mark Edelstone - Morgan Stanley
Good afternoon. Andy. For you, what type of inventory build should we expect on your balance sheet here this quarter? 
Andy Bryant
I would guess this quarter will be similar to last quarter, which without share-based compensation was around $300 million. I would guess it's in the ballpark. 
Mark Edelstone - Morgan Stanley
And then just so I'm clear, the microprocessor revenues are down about 15% sequentially. If I take a relatively slight decline in ASPs it sounds like units would have been down about 12% sequentially in Q1. Is that about the right order of magnitude? 
Andy Bryant
You're probably pretty good at math. I actually haven't calculated that number so I don't know. But it's probably in that neighborhood. 
Mark Edelstone - Morgan Stanley
I think AMD disclosed their units were down 6%. I was just trying to reconcile the comments on the share issue in the quarter. 
Paul Otellini
Well, if you go back to what they said, they said they believe they gained revenue share. They didn't say anything about unit share, to my knowledge. We've done the math. We know what we shipped and we did the math on what they shipped. By the way, just on your number, you may be assuming too aggressive of an ASP decline for Intel in your comments there. We said slight. 
Mark Edelstone - Morgan Stanley
Okay, fair enough. Just last question on the operating expense guidance, especially for the implications for the second half of the year. It certainly seems like pretty aggressive goals. Can you get to those goals without some type of restructuring or head count reduction? 
Andy Bryant
In order to hit those goals, there would have to be some kind of head count reduction, probably similar to being on full attrition and then conserving around the edges. So making sure you control your discretionary spending. It does not require a layoff to make those numbers. It just requires discipline around not hiring people. 
Mark Edelstone - Morgan Stanley
Thank you very much. 
Operator
Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Chris Danely of JP Morgan. 
Chris Danely - JP Morgan
Thanks, guys. We're all concerned about a price war out here. If I do the math on the full year revenue guidance it sounds like you guys are expecting about 15% sequential growth in Q3 and Q4. Are you not anticipating a price war in microprocessors in the second half in order to gain back the market share? 
Andy Bryant
I don't know what a price war means. I think we're going to be bringing better products that compete better against the competition. I think that price will still be necessary to win back market share we lost. So I guess I would imply, we've had as Paul said, in certain markets, we've had pretty aggressive pricing through the first part of this year. It may lighten a little bit in those markets, but you'll continue to be on normal price curves for all your products. ASPs will be down some through the year. 
Chris Danely - JP Morgan
So you're expecting a normal price curve in the second half of the year, nothing too crazy? 
Andy Bryant
We're not expecting anything crazy, but it is a competitive environment. Even as we bring out new products and new capabilities, you have to win business back that you lost. 
Chris Danely - JP Morgan
A philosophical question, Paul. If you have the choice between sacrificing a little bit of margin but gaining back your market share, which choice would you take? 
Paul Otellini
I would take the choice that keeps my factories the fullest. 
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Tom Thornhill of UBS. 
Tom Thornhill - UBS
Creating demand for the new products is going to be a function also of meeting that ramp with the 1264 capacity. Do you feel that the ramp is going to be able to meet that demand? And to the degree it's not, what gives you the conviction you'll be able to substitute product coming out of the 1262 process? 
Paul Otellini
Well, the largest consumer of our 65 nanometer process today are the dual-core desktop and notebook products that we launched in January. Those products were designed to be able to afford a fast ramp on 65 nanometers and the new products coming in are socket compatible with those. So to some extent, it's a much easier transition than, say, when we brought the Prescott product on a couple years ago or the first Centrino product, both of which were platform changes. 
Secondly, we've got three factories now humming at very good yields and very high production on the products. So our comfort level with both the health of the products and the health of the processes and the ability to continue to ramp is much smarter now than it was three months ago when we had just begun shipping these. 
Andy Bryant
So we'll show you some data next week, Tom, on the health of the process in the factories. It looks as good as anything we've done. 
Paul Otellini
Yes. And go back to what I said earlier; this month we will have the crossover on 65 nanometer wafer starts; more processors wafer starts on 65 than on 90. 
Tom Thornhill - UBS
Okay. A follow-up if I could, Andy, on some analysis on COGS. One approach is to take out depreciation and look at the residual or the proxy for direct labor, direct materials. The ratios through '04 and '05 were running in the 29% to 31% range. It looks like we're headed into a period where it's going to be more like 35%. So higher COGS and some lower margin. 
Is this something we should think of as a structural issue with direct materials, direct labor versus dual-core products and die size? Or is this a temporary issue where we'll get back to those previous ratios when we get past this? 
Andy Bryant
I have to go look at it in detail. I'm a little bit winging my answer for you. If I look at today, I'd say a little of each. We do know that there's been constraints in substrates, some of the material COGS have gone up and I think those will last for a while. On the other hand, we also know that as we go to the smaller die, we'll get less labor COGS per die, so we'll see some benefits there. The efficiency project Paul is talking about will be focused in that space. And recognize your 35%, when you just pull out depreciation, there are some reserves and things like that in that costs of goods sold. So in reality 35% sounds high to me. It will go back down towards historical low. My guess is it will settle above where it's been during some of the material cost issues. 
Tom Thornhill - UBS
Thank you. 
Operator
Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, our next question comes from the line of Ben Lynch of Deutsche Bank. 
Ben Lynch - Deutsche Bank
Andy, a question for you and sorry it's a little bit long, but I think you'll get the gist of it. You guys attributed the trend of the Q4 revenue shortfall to excess customer inventories at the end of Q3. Then you attributed the original 300 million shortfall in the Q1 guidance to customer; again, 300 million customer inventories at the end of Q4. Now you're saying Q2 below seasonal is -- I guess it works out about 400 million excess inventory. That sounds like a lot of accumulated excess inventory. 
Is part of what you're saying here is maybe the initial diagnosis was wrong on that? The way inventories work, if Q1 already saw some inventory drawdown, which I think you said, then for Q2 to be below seasonal, then the amount of drawdown would be a lot more than it was already in Q1. But if you're saying there's only one to two weeks of excess out there, that doesn't seem possible. I'm really just trying to understand all of that, please. I do have a follow-up. 
Andy Bryant
Okay. So, my answer will be as long as your question, is my suspicion. As we ended the third quarter, we believe there's about $100 million of excess inventory out there. Looking back it's possible there's a little bit more, but not significantly more. 
In the fourth quarter, we believe there's about $100 million of excess inventory out there. In retrospect, after the quarter, remember when we got to the end of the quarter, we had a bunch of cancellations and we were trying to figure out what's going on. We saw the weaker market and we still thought we ended the quarter at a $100 million excess. 
When we looked back later, we said we were wrong, it was probably more than twice that. So the excess inventory at the beginning of the first quarter was higher than we thought. 
As we go into this current quarter, what's happening is our customers are indicating they want leaner inventories as they prepare for the second half. So that's not necessarily inventory that was excess to begin with. But as they reset their inventory targets because of a weaker growth environment and preparing, clearing their deck for the newer products, there's a further reduction they're looking for. 
So it's kind of a combination of, we think we lost a little more share than we thought in the fourth quarter. Therefore, the inventory was a little larger than we thought. The Q4 burn off was relatively small. Customers are resetting low inventories now for the second quarter. A combination of all that is why the second quarter numbers comes out so big. 
Ben Lynch - Deutsche Bank
Great. And then just a second question I had was the notebook or mobility CP RAS looks sort of flattish but operating profit was down very significantly. You raised the mix, but in the process, cut prices a lot for the high end so that you got maybe flattish ASPs overall, but the price on the mix degraded a lot and that's behind the operating profit decline? Or is there something else, something off or something there? 
Andy Bryant
It's more on the cost side. As we begin to ramp the new products - so that's one of the place we hedged some of the reserves. It's also one of the places where some of the older products got revalued downward because the new costs were much lower. So in essence, think in terms of the revenue drop, kind of drops through at 100%. Then you have some other inventory issues causing it to go down a couple hundred more million. 
Ben Lynch - Deutsche Bank
Thank you. 
Operator
Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, our next question comes from the line of Apjit Walia of RBC Capital Markets. 
Apjit Walia - RBC Capital Markets
Thank you, good evening. A question on the second half. You're assuming market share gains back in the second half, in your assumptions. If all else is equal and you don't gain any share back in the second half, how will that impact your guidance for revenue? 
Andy Bryant
So, I won't give you specific number. Again, add your $400 million to $500 million into Q2, run seasonal Q3 and Q4, subtract it from down 3% and you'll get your number. The bigger number does rely more on the inventory correction reset than it does on a share win back. 
Apjit Walia - RBC Capital Markets
One long-term question. Given the competitive dynamics you're seeing from AMD at this point in the recent threshold, do you see your long-term growth margin band which is say late 40s, early 50s, to early 60s, do you see that contract in the next couple of years? 
Andy Bryant
Boy, I hate to make a long-term gross margin prediction. It's been between 50 and 60 for years and years and years. If we can, as I said earlier, we can continue to drive costs, which I think we have a chance to, we have a pretty good opportunity to keep margins at a pretty good level. We do have to drive the cost element. 
Apjit Walia - RBC Capital Markets
And just one clarification. Your chipset constraint issue from last year, is that something completely removed now? 
Andy Bryant
Essentially so, yes. Combination between our chipsets and a third party's should meet all the market needs. 
Apjit Walia - RBC Capital Markets
Okay. Thank you. 
Doug Lusk
Operator, we'll take two more questions, please. 
Operator
Thank you very much, sir. Your next question comes from the line of Tim Luke of Lehman Brothers. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers
Thanks. I guess for Paul or Andy, just in guiding for a somewhat more moderate market, but suggesting you'll get the share gain in the second half. Could you give us a sense of where you would expect to make the share gain most materially? Would that be in the notebook, desktop, or in the server area, maybe any comments on the dynamics you see in terms of your share positioning for the second half in those arenas? Thank you. 
Paul Otellini
I'm not going to give you a specific set of numbers. Over the last year, the steepest market segment share loss was in servers and we have -- we think -- an extremely compelling product line coming out with Woodcrest so we've already begun shipping its platform with the Blackbird platform in Dempsey now, so that one I expect to start turning the corner on in terms of market segment share fairly rapidly after launch. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers
A blind stabilization or gain, in your view? 
Paul Otellini
Yes, exactly. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers
Which one? 
Paul Otellini
Well, stabilizing and then gain. You have to do one before the other. In mobile we've had actually fairly good traction the last few years with Centrino. I think the Merom product is icing on the cake in terms of giving us accelerated lead there. 
The one that is very interesting is Conroe. It is the most significant performance gain that we've brought into the marketplace from an Intel perspective since we introduced the Pentium versus the 486. This product at the same time lowers the power, so I think that that one we'll see immediate uptick in two areas and the enterprise as it's associated with our new brand, platform brand for business desktop, and in the gamer high-end community and workstation community where they want to use that heat-seeking kind of performance that this product will deliver. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers
As a follow-up if I could I ask, with respect to the second quarter, Andy, when you think about digital enterprise and mobility, should the sequential decline that you're forecasting be fairly similar between those two areas, or would it be more pronounced in the digital enterprise arena? 
Andy Bryant
Again, if you're looking at year-over-year trends, we've seen stronger growth in mobile than we have in the digital enterprise. So I would tend to look at my last few quarters of year-over-year and assume it's similar to what you've seen there. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers
Thanks. 
Operator
Thank you very much, sir. Our final question comes from the line of Chris Caso of Friedman, Billings, Ramsey. 
Chris Caso - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey
Hi, guys, thanks for taking my question. Andy, I wonder if you could expand a little bit on some of the unit cost comments that you made. I think you were implying that the new products in the second half would have smaller die size. Maybe you could talk on that with respect to products that are going to come in at similar price points on a price point per price point basis, are you going to enjoy a smaller die size? 
Andy Bryant
The answer is yes. What I'm trying to get to show for you next week at the analysts' meeting would be to show you the dual-core costs. Typical we only show average microprocessor and I'm trying to get a chart that will show you the dual core so you can actually see how the new products come in and how it changes the costs of those products at the high end. That is where you'd expect to see most of the benefit probably more in the fourth quarter than the third quarter and certainly next year. But again, I'll try to give you that next week. 
Chris Caso - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey
Just finally, with respect to Vista coming out at the beginning of 2007, given your revenue guidance for the second half of the year, it seems like you guys are not dialing any impact of that. I guess it's anybody's question what the consumer actually does, but safe to say that's your assumption at this point? 
Paul Otellini
Well, that is our assumption. That's been the history. If you look at normal seasonality the last five years, it did not include an operating system release. That's where we're modeling on that same kind of seasonality. When you go back to the XP release, which was a late Q3 early Q4 release, you saw a bit of a gyration because it impacted enterprise as well as consumer. Right now, we don't see that there will be any kind of material impact in the fourth quarter. But boy that's a long way off to call. 
Chris Caso - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey
Thanks. 
Doug Lusk

Thanks, Doug.  I will keep my comments brief, and then turn it over to Andy for more details on the results for the quarter and the full year.  2005 was a record year for Intel for both revenue and operating income as we posted our third straight year of double-digit growth.  These strong results came in a year, where we underwent the largest reorganization in our Company’s history, as we realigned our company around platform solutions.

We’ve just recently seen the fruits of this effort with the launch of CES of two exciting new platforms.  Centrino Duo for notebooks and Viiv for the digital home.  2005 was also a year of many other notable accomplishments including our entries to the fast growing demand to market segment with sort of a new relationship with Apples, and shipments of millions of dual core processors including the first built on our industry leading 65-nanometer process technology.

Fourth quarter results also set records with new highs in revenue and operating income as we surpassed the $10 billion revenue level for the first time.  We continue to see strong demand for our notebook platforms and shipped record units of mobile, desktop, and server CPUs during the quarter.  However, we were disappointed that results in the last part of the quarter fell below our previous expectations.  The shortfall was a combination of a number of factors resulting from the continuing constraint of internal chipsets.  We overestimated the ability of third party suppliers of chipsets and motherboards to ramp supply late in the quarter resulting in about 1 point of share loss in the low-end desktop CPU market segment.

In addition we believe end demand for desktop PCs weakened somewhat over the course of the quarter and this became evident as expected turns business from OEM and channel customers failed to materialize in December.  Pricing was also a bit lower than we expected in a very competitive desktop market segment.  As a result we believe that our OEM customers increased their CPU inventories rather than decreasing them; resulting in a lower than seasonal expectation for Q1.  Although fourth quarter results fell below our December guidance revenue did come in at the low-end of the range we set in October.  As you know our practice has been to provide a revenue range at the beginning of each quarter and narrow it at our mid quarter update.

As the Company has grown to current revenue levels of approximately $10 billion per quarter we believe that narrowing ranges to plus or minus 1% of revenue is increasingly less relevant as an indicator of the performance of the Company.  More importantly we manage our business to deliver long-term earnings growth and believe this current process is not effective in communicating our progress towards that objective and only heightens attention to short-term results.  Therefore, beginning this year we will return to our previous process and the one prevalent in the industry by providing annual and quarterly guidance but not a mid quarter update.  At the same time beginning this year we will start providing further insight into how we view our business by adding annual revenue and spending projections to our outlook each January.  Our goal is to have more meaningful discussions about the long-term strategies and trends for our business.

In summary, 2005 was a record year for Intel with strong financial results and numerous significant accomplishments.  Although the year did not finish as strong as we expected we look to another solid year of growth in 2006.  Thanks in part to a very strong product roadmap.  65-nanometer process technology is healthy and ramping exciting, new, dual core products such as the Core Duo into high volume.  We expect the majority of our shipments and performance segments to be dual core by mid year.  And in the second half of 2006 we will launch a new micro architecture that we expect will deliver performance per watt leadership in mobile, desktop and server settle.  We remain confident in long-term growth opportunities in our business such as mobility, the digital home, digital office and emerging markets.  With that I will turn it over to Andy for more details on the quarter.

Andy Bryant, Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Paul.  2005 was a great year punctuated by a difficult December.  As Paul discussed unexpected issues with the timing of chipset supply demand in the desktop segment and practicing of logic products resulted in less growth than we usually see in the final weeks of the year.  For all of 2005, revenue, gross margin dollars, operating income, and net income each achieved year to year growth rates in the double-digits.  Stock repurchases and cash dividends returned over $12 billion to stockholders.  Quarterly average shares outstanding were down nearly 5% from a year ago and 11% from the peak in 1998.  We delivered not only our third consecutive year of double-digit growth in revenues, which Paul mentioned; but also our fourth year is the fourth consecutive year of progress in gross profit margin.  And our tenth year in a row with cash from operations in excess of $8 billion.

Our outlook for 2006 anticipates another year of growth but at a slower rate than the last three years in line with industry forecasts and the overall economy.  To prepare for silicon demand in the years beyond 2006 we are substantially increasing research and development and capital spending.  Revenue for the fourth quarter was $10.2 billion at the low-end of the range we forecast in the October earnings release, and below the range in the December update.  Although revenue grew a little over 2% from the third quarter this is lower than is typical for this period.  Compared to the fourth quarter a year ago revenue grew approximately 6%.  Revenue for the second half was up 8% over the first half within the range of the last five and ten years and approximately 12% over the second half of 2004.

On a geographic basis the sequential growth in revenue came from the greater Europe region.  Asia Pacific was flat with the third quarter at the low-end of historical range, primarily due to some softness in the desktop segment.  In the Americas revenue was down almost 4% with most of the decline concentrated in the United States, offset somewhat by growth in Latin America.  Year to year growth for the fourth quarter was led by Asia Pacific at 16% and Japan at 11% driven by demand for mobile computing, chipsets, and flash memory.  Europe was flat with the fourth quarter a year ago.  The year to year decline of 10% for the Americas region is primarily a function of continuing movement of sales from manufacturing to Asia Pacific.  For the year overall, Asia Pacific was nearly half the total revenue followed by Europe with 21% of revenue.

Gross margin dollars of 6.3 billion were up 6% from the third quarter when results included a charge $140 million related to a legal settlement and up 17% from a year ago.  Gross margin percentage of 61.8% improved 2-points from the third quarter and is up substantially from a year ago.  The result was just below the range of the forecast in December due to a lower inventory, lower revenue and inventory evaluations.  61.8% compares to 59.7% in the third quarter which included 1.4 points for the legal charge.  As we anticipated in October, gross margin benefited from the qualification of new dual core products as we ramp 65-nanometer.  This accounted for the largest part of the improvement from the third quarter.  The gains in gross profit were offset somewhat by reducing valuations of logic products due to lower unit costs.

In the year to year comparison gross margin percentage is nearly 6-points higher than the fourth quarter of 2004.  Higher revenues, higher factory utilization, and lower unit costs contributed to better gross profit margins than a year ago.  Spending, R&D and MG&A was $3 billion, consistent with our previous forecasts and up 5% from the third quarter.  For the year, spending was 28% of revenue approximately the same level as in 2004.  The number of employees rose during the quarter to 100,000 at the end of December, up from 85,000 a year ago.

Before looking at non-operating income I will highlight results for Intel's largest operating segment.  A little less than two-thirds of the total revenue came from digital enterprise group which was flat with the third quarter and down 5% from a year ago.  Operating profit for the digital enterprise group was up 13% sequentially and flat from a year ago.  Revenue at Intel's mobility group accounted for nearly one fourth of total revenue.  Revenue from mobile microprocessors was up 3% from the third quarter and 40% from a year ago.  With the success of mobile platforms, revenue from mobile chipsets and other products was up 66% year to year.  The mobility group also made progress in operating profit, up 8% from the third quarter and 63% from a year ago.

Our flash memory business revenue was up 5% from the third quarter although flat from 2004 overall.  For the entire year flash revenue was flat with 2004.  With the formation of IM flash technologies, a joint venture with Micron, we will report flash memory revenue and operating profit as part of a new operating segment.

Now to non-operating items.  The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 29.1%.  Intel's third quarter tax rate of 38.5% included accrual of tax expense of approximately $250 million related to the repatriation of accumulated income earned abroad.  Fully diluted earnings per share were $0.40.  This is well above $0.32 in the third quarter which included a charge related to the legal settlement and a charge related to repatriation of foreign earnings which together lowered earnings per share by approximately $0.06.  On the balance sheet inventories of $3.1 billion were up over $300 million from the third quarter.  As anticipated in October, we built inventories with the production of more 65-nanometer processors.

Total cash investments comprised of cash, short-term investments, and fixed income trading assets ended the quarter at $12.4 billion, a decrease of 1.2 billion from the third quarter after stock repurchases of $3.1 billion, capital spending of 1.4 billion, and dividend payments of nearly 500 million.  Long-term debt grew to $2.1 billion, up from 432 million, following the issuance of $1.6 billion in convertible securities.

As we turn now to the outlook for the first quarter please keep in mind that the forecast data do not include the effects of any new acquisitions, divestitures, or similar transactions that may completed after January 16.  I will use a mid point of forecast ranges when making comparisons to specific periods.

We are planning for revenue in the first quarter to be between 9.1 and $9.7 billion.  The midpoint of this range would mean a sequential decline of 8%, although this is within a wide historical range for the period, it is less than the typical seasonal growth.  This is flat compared to the first quarter of 2005 which included 14 weeks instead of 13.  It also incorporates what we believe will be the impact of an inventory build at our customers in the fourth quarter.  Our expectation for gross margin percentage in the first quarter is 59% plus or minus a couple of points.  This includes share-based compensation expenses, a non-cash charge which we will begin recognizing in the first quarter.  Without share-based compensation of approximately 1 point of margin, the forecast for gross margin percentage is 60% plus or minus a couple of points.  This is down two points from the fourth quarter due primarily to start up costs for IM Flash technologies, the NAND memory joint venture, lower revenues, and inventory valuations.

Spending, R&D plus MG&A should be approximately $3.3 billion, higher than the fourth quarter due to the impact of share-based compensation expense.  The forecast includes approximately $300 million of share-based compensation, a non-cash expense.  Without the impact of these charges spending should be about $3 billion, flat with the fourth quarter.  Depreciation should be $1.1 billion plus or minus $100 million.  We expect amortization of acquisition related intangibles for the first quarter to be approximately $20 million.  Our estimate for gains and losses from equity investments and interest and other income is a net gain of $140 million.

Looking ahead to the full year we are planning for revenue growth of 6 to 9% led by mobile computing and emerging markets.  The pace of year to year growth and our plan is slower than in recent years tempered somewhat by the outlook for the worldwide economy.  We expect gross margin percentage to be 57% plus or minus a few points.  Without share-based compensation of approximately 1 point of margin the forecast is 58% plus or miles a few points.  This is down more than 1 point from gross margin in 2005.  Lower start up costs for logic products will help lift margin from 2005 levels, but this will be more than offset by slightly higher unit costs and slightly lower average selling prices for microprocessors and start up costs for the NAND memory joint venture.

At the same time we are ramping the 65-nanometer process technology, we are also moving ahead with a transition to even smaller geometries and increasing our investments in manufacturing technology and capacity.  We are targeting overall capital spending at $6.9 billion plus or minus 200 million, an increase of 19% over 5.8 billion in 2005.  Most of the projected increase will be spent on construction and long lead purchases to support 45-nanometer capacity requirements.  With plan to invest in a construction of two 300 millimeter, 45-nanometer factories in Arizona and Israel both announced last year.  We believe the capacity will help maintain Intel leadership in providing silicon to a growing, global market and the technology will be an advantage that enables us to deliver better products at competitive unit costs.

For research and development in 2006, we plan to spend approximately $6.5 billion, an increase from the $5.1 billion we spent in 2005.  The forecast includes share-based compensation of approximately $500 million, a non-cash expense.  R&D spending excluding share-based expenses would grow to $6 billion.  Most of the increase in the budget will be directed to product development and validation for platform products.  As is the case almost every year this is the highest level of R&D spending in Intel's history.

Total spending for the year including not only R&D but marketing and G&A is forecast at 13.1 billion.  This includes the impact of share-based compensation of $1.1 billion.  Excluding this impact total spending is forecast at 12 billion which is $1.2 billion or 11% higher than 2005.  This spending growth exceeds projected revenue growth for the year and deviates from what remains our long-term goal of keeping one in line with the other.  Excluding projected spending in IM flash the year to year growth will be 9%.  The largest dollar and percentage increase is in R&D for resources to deliver new platforms for new markets.  Depreciation for the year is forecast at $4.7 billion plus or minus $100 million, up from $4.3 billion in 2005.  The estimated tax rate for 2006 is 32%.

In summary, 2005 was a good year and the Company is in excellent financial condition.  We are planning for another year of growth and are optimistic that our competitive position will improve as we see the fruits of investments in new products and new manufacturing capabilities.  In any year while the economy may fluctuate we can be certain that the pace of technical innovation will not stop.  Our investments are a statement of confidence in the future of innovation.  With that let me turn it over to Doug for Q&A.

Doug Lusk, Director, Investor Relations

Thanks, Andy.  We will now open the call for Q&A.  We will attempt to take questions from as many participants as possible.  To help in this process we ask that you please limit yourselves to only one question and no more than one brief follow-up.  Thank you.  Operator?

Questions and Answers

Operator

Yes, sir.  Thank you.  Operator Instructions Sir, our first quarter is from the line of Tim Luke with Lehman Brothers.

Q - Tim Luke

Thank you.  Andy, I was wondering if you could frame the extent of the inventory build that you described in the fourth quarter in guiding us somewhat lower than seasonal first quarter off a somewhat lower than expected fourth quarter.  Thank you.

A - Andy Bryant

Sure, the easiest way to frame that is really to look at the Q1 outlook.  The Q1 revenue outlook calls for the midpoint to be down approximately 8%.  If that we were having, and I know seasonals a wide range, but if we were having a seasonal first quarter it would have been down approximately 5%.  The difference 3 percentage points is roughly equal to what we think the inventory is on hand at our customers that needs to be worked off.

Q - Tim Luke

I was also wondering, Andy, if you could just give some more color on the gross margin outlook going forward in terms of suggesting that there were lower start up costs but I think you said offset by the higher unit costs and lower ASPs.  If you could give some color on those issues that would be helpful.

A - Andy Bryant

Sure.  I will do what I can.  I can't give you too much detail on that.  As we all remember throughout 2005 we had the start up costs on the 65-nanometer and the fact that process was going into several factories which depressed gross margin percentage.  We will see positive or an uplift in margin in '06 because we no longer have those expenses.  On the other hand we did enter into the IM flash joint venture which will begin NAND memory production in several factories this year.  It is not quite as expensive as doing our start up in our logic factories; but it is similar in nature and the way the contract with the joint venture is structured those costs come directly into our P&L.  So you can almost think that those two will offset each other.  In the meantime, I do expect unit costs to go up slightly.  To give you a simple indication, if our revenue growth for the year hits out mid point of 7.5% you can look at my depreciation cost is going to go up more in terms of 8 to 9%.  So I am going to take a little cost pressure there.  Headcount generally in the factories relate to the capital expense so I will take probably a little bit of cost pressure there.  Right now materials going into finished products has been tight for the last year or so, a little bit of cost pressure there.  So what you are seeing is no big change other than a little bit of pressure in each cost element.  Same thing if you look at average selling prices.  Remember I'm talking about a year-over-year, what we saw in the fourth quarter was average selling prices step down a little.  If you just take that number and compare it, blow it through that entire next year you are going to see average selling prices a little bit lower year to year.  So there are no big, wow, there's a huge change coming type numbers in here, there are a series of small events that are going to tend to put margin pressure down a point on a year to year comparison if you exclude share-based costs.  If you don't it will be down 2-points.

Q - Tim Luke

Thanks.

Operator

And, sir, our next question is from the line of Sumit Dhanda with Banc of America Securities.

Q - Sumit Dhanda

Andy, I had a question on, you talked about the fact that demand for low-end desktops was below expectations and that impacted your growth.  But your mobile segment growth was also what I would say is subpar given how well that segment has grown in recent quarters.  Could you talk about what's happening there and is there a share loss issue, was there a slow down within the notebook market that you didn't allude to earlier in your comments?

A - Andy Bryant

Well, we thought the mobile business did pretty well in the fourth quarter as expected so I don't know where you got information.  We had certainly record shipments in that space.  If you look at what we thought was quote, the shortfall in revenue from the mid quarter update, I'd say maybe a little bit in mobile but it's really not much change.

Q - Sumit Dhanda

I guess my point was that you reported 3% growth whereas seasonality would have dictated better growth within your mobile segment?

A - Andy Bryant

A little bit.  Recognize that some of the growth went into the lower end value stuff which maybe was what contributed a small amount of our pricing stuff.  But in reality mobile did fine.  I would not be talking about a revenue shortfall if we were dealing in the mobile business exclusively.

Q - Sumit Dhanda

The other question I had was, this seems to be the second straight quarter where your OEM base has built some level of inventory, the 100 million the prior quarter and this quarter you are implying roughly 300 million.  Could you talk about why, I mean, is that just, first of all, relegated to your OEM customer base and are you seeing a similar build in the channel and if not why not?

A - Andy Bryant

Well, it isn't the OEM and the multinationals.  If you go, study your balance sheet carefully you can actually figure out what our inventory is in the channel; it was down in the fourth quarter and channel sales out were at a record.  The other thing I want to correct is there wasn't a $300 million inventory build in the fourth quarter; there is a total of between, say 250 and $300 million excess inventory in the customers hands today.  They would also have billed in the first quarter.  So you have got to add the two together to get to the total effect.  In general what I would suspect is you are seeing some after effect of the constraints we've been in and the customer is trying to match chipsets and the timing of when chipsets are coming from third party suppliers and our products, it's a fairly complex equation and you certainly wouldn't want to be caught short if you had the chipsets and the motherboards available.  I don't think it's anything other than that at this time.

Q - Sumit Dhanda

One final question.  I mean when can we start to see a better match between the revenue growth and your cost structure? It seems to be a little out of whack right now.

A - Andy Bryant

Well, I actually think we improved margins in '05 and that was revenue growth exceeding the cost structure.  I do believe it will turn a little bit the other way this year.  It really is a factor of if we can drive revenue I can hold cost, I can leverage my fixed cost base pretty well.  If revenue can't be driven then I have got to address costs, but certainly not something you do in the short-term and not something you do today facing what should be a high single-digit revenue growth.

Q - Sumit Dhanda

Okay.  Thank you.

Operator

And sir, our next question is from the line of Glen Yeung with Citigroup Investment Research.

Q - Glen Yeung

Andy, when we look at your forecast for revenues for 2006 at 6 to 9% growth.  Can you give us a sense as to what you think underlying PC growth is when you come up with that number?

A - Andy Bryant

Sure.  What we are guessing for underlying PC growth is somewhere in the high single digits, low double-digits, so 9, 10, 11%, somewhere in that range.  Mostly we've seen that from external forecasts as we've had conversation with customers.  We've looked at macro economic data.  It's kind of what we have settled on as a good target.

Q - Glen Yeung

You made the comment in your prepared remarks that with some of the new products that you are introducing in 2006; I think the words you used were that you could gain share.  I just want to get a sense of if that's exactly what you mean, you think you will be up higher market share in 2006 or maybe just slow the rate of loss?

A - Paul Otellini

Let me take that one.  What I said was I thought we would be able to be in a position to retake share over the course of 2006.

Q - Glen Yeung

I'm not quite sure I understand that.  So, I'm sorry--.

A - Paul Otellini

Net gain.

Q - Glen Yeung

Gain.  Thank you.  Just to be absolutely clear.  If I could just ask one more quick question on expenditures.  You were seeing a big CapEx number, a big R&D number.  I get the sense that there seems to be some acceleration here of hitting the 45-nanometer manufacturing node.  I want to get a sense as to whether or not that's an accurate read and whether or not you think that's technologically achievable?

A - Andy Bryant

I don't really think acceleration.  I think we are still on our two-year cadence.  It turns out if you are on a two-year cadence towards the end of this year you need to start spending a fair amount of money to get the equipment in place and get started.

Q - Glen Yeung

Okay.  Thanks.

Operator

And sir, our next question is from the line of Tom Thornhill with UBS.

Q - Tom Thornhill

Paul, it feels like you've accelerated several programs and some spending in order to strengthen a competitive position.  We'll bear the brunt of that through the first half.  When do you really feel that that will pay off and get the Company back into the operating ratios that we've seen over the last year or so?

A - Paul Otellini

Well, the acceleration, the spending acceleration really is focused on the deployment plans for 45-nanometers and from our perspective is not an acceleration; it's the deployment that we've been planning for some time as Andy indicated in the two-year cycle.  I don't see that as being an acceleration.  Spending is a bit higher in R&D and we believe that we need to do that to be able to deploy fully on the platform plans that we have in store for '06 and '07.  We launched two new platforms in January and we will be launching another one kind of in mid year for the business client.  Those are more complex developments, more comprehensive developments than we've had before.  In terms of operating ratios it really all hinges on the revenue.  I think that part what have you are hearing from us is that as the fourth quarter ended up being lower than we thought and the first quarter is more than seasonally down as a result of the inventory that Andy discussed, we are starting out in a bit more of a hole for '06 than we first had thought.  And we hope to be able to capitalize on any revenue opportunities and a lot of it's going to depend on the product health and the competitiveness of those products in terms of whether we can gain share and how much share we will gain.

Q - Tom Thornhill

Would it be your opinion that the ratios that we are going to see here in the near term are a temporary phenomenon? That as the new products come to market and if you get the share gains you anticipate getting that the Company gets back into the operating model that it had in terms of……

A - Paul Otellini

Yes.  In terms of spending versus revenue growth absolutely.  Andy implied that we are a little bit backwards here as we enter '06 because of momentum we had going out of '05 in terms of hiring and stuff, and we had already built a plan, a conservative spending plan into '06 and now there's a little less revenue around that plan than we at first thought.  And so as the revenue picks up you will see us get the spending growth versus revenue growth back in line.  You have our commitment to continue to focus on growing revenue faster than spending.

Q - Tom Thornhill

Okay, that would apply to gross margin as well?

A - Paul Otellini

Well, gross margin is a slightly different question.  I mean, that one view there is to grow gross margin dollars and not necessarily focus on the percent as we've talked about before.

Q - Tom Thornhill

All right.  One last one for Andy.  What would you expect the direction in share count to be across the '06 year?

A - Andy Bryant

In theory I'm not supposed to answer prospective buyback questions, but it should be lower across the year.

Q - Tom Thornhill

Similar to '05?

A - Andy Bryant

I can't go that specific.

Q - Tom Thornhill

Thank you.

Operator

Sir, our next question is from the line of Adam Parker with Sanford Bernstein.

Q - Adam Parker

Hi.  I just want to say thanks for canceling the mid quarter updates.  I think that's positive.  Now, in terms of the longer term issues you want to talk about, I just want to talk about 2007 if we can for a minute.  Can you talk at all about your gross margins as we look out a couple of years in terms of 45-nanometer start ups, depreciation looks like it will rise and how should we think about your operating expenses there as well? And also it doesn't look like you can continue to buy back stock at the current rate for more than a couple of years.  So what would your strategy be as you run out of cash there?

A - Andy Bryant

It's going to be tough for me to make a gross margin percentage prediction for '07.  We do focus on capital efficiency.  We do plan to try to do the best we can with that.  As Paul said we do try for positive return on invested capital and absolute dollar margins.  It really the big factor will turn out to be end demand; if we have decent end demand and full factories costs will be fine.  If we don't we will struggle.  As far as the cash, you are absolutely right.  If you look at this year, we've been pulling about $1 billion a quarter out of cash.  We will meet with our Board again in the first quarter and set a cash target with them and then we will use, the way we do the work internally, is we say what projects do we have to fund, what dividend can we sustain for a long period of time, and then we use buybacks to try to get the cash to the level we think it should be.  So there's a point at which time the buyback will diminish as we come more in line with the cash targets that we have.

Q - Tom Thornhill

Okay.  No comments on 45 costs or depreciation, '07 versus '06 yet?

A - Andy Bryant

No, it's too early.  Even though in reality I wouldn't give you that type of data for a year.  I think we will start to see meaningful data in the first half of the year.  We will provide your cost of unit forecast in the spring analyst meeting so will you start to get a sense for where we think we are headed.  I really think I need to wait on that one.

Q - Tom Thornhill

Okay.  Just one more short-term question then instead of long-term.  I am kind of thick on this one here but I don't understand how your inventory builds internally, whatever it is, 10%, your big OEMs build inventory, yet there's a chipset shortage that lowered your revenue.  Can you explain that? And then just, are you comfortable with inventory levels now or should we expect a further build here in Q1 and Q2?

A - Andy Bryant

I would expect, let's see, the simple question is I expect to further build in Q1.  Let me talk about Q2 as we see what revenue looks like in Q2.  But I do expect a further build in Q1.  We were building obviously for a higher Q4 and a higher Q1.  As a result, pending a three-month throughput time, I'll collect some more inventory.  The levels I'm at today don't disturb me in the slightest.  I could use more chipset, finished goods inventory.  I still need to get a little more inventory in my 65-nanometer processor lines.  I still have to make a transition between the 90 and 65.  So today's inventory levels I'm very comfortable with.  My guess is I will build some in the first quarter.  My second guess is I will try to get those down some through the rest of the year.

Q - Tom Thornhill

In terms of this explaining about what happened, I mean, the chipset shortage, how do you build so much inventory internally and externally yet not yet have lower, yet not meet demand? Is it all nonprocessor?

A - Andy Bryant

The simple answer is we anticipated third party chipsets coming into the marketplace quicker than they did, which meant we could have married up processors to motherboards to chipsets and we all could have had a little less inventory.  So the chipset imbalance we think got us hopefully one last time.

Q - Tom Thornhill

Do you think that will be okay?  Got you.  Okay.  Thanks.

Operator

Sir, our next question is from the line of Ben Lynch with Deutsche Bank.

Q - Ben Lynch

Hi, guys, Paul, maybe I will just give you one first.  I know you like to be precise.  You said you believe Intel will be in a position to retake share during the course of '06.  Is this the same thing as saying taking share or just be in a position to take share?

A - Andy Bryant

He's saying are you going to actually take it..

A - Paul Otellini

Oh, we plan to.

Q - Ben Lynch

You plan to.  Is this more sort of second half and do you think that along with--?

A - Paul Otellini

If you look at '05 we took share, we gained share in the first half of the year and we lost a little bit in the second half of the year.  And I think our product portfolio particularly in mobile and desktop as we shift aggressively to dual core only gets stronger and then we have two server platforms launching in 2006.  One is the Bentley platform which will ship this quarter for our customer shipments in Q2 and then we will ship in second generation on 65-nanometers in the second half of next year.  So, I believe you will be able to plot the regain of market share or the take back of market share along the dual core ramp of the Company across multiple segments.

Q - Ben Lynch

Great.  And then maybe one, I guess for Andy.  Yes, I just want to point out that the bubble bursting, what you've guided to is the worse 1Q over 4Q following the worst 4Q over 3Q of the past decade and it sort of seems like most of this is coming down to inventory.  It's strange that after some inventory build in Q3 there was an even greater magnitude in Q4.  Unless you are basically telling us that end demand was a lot worse or else your specific customers were losing share or else they have been building inventory principally of Intel processors.

A - Andy Bryant

We don't think end demand was a lot worse.  We do believe there was some disconnect between our processors getting connected to chipsets and motherboards which caused a bit of the problem.  We do believe end demand and flow in desktop was lower than you seasonally would expect so there is a little bit of demands there.  We do believe, we haven't seen the AMD numbers yet but we believe we lost up to 1 point of market share to AMD through these things.  So it all triangulates but that, I realize it doesn't leave you with a great feeling of comfort.  I understand that.

Q - Ben Lynch

Okay.  We will see what AMD says.  We will see how Q1 goes for you.  Thank you.

Operator

And sir, our next question is from the line of David Wong with A.G. Edwards.

Q - David Wong

Thank you very much.  You may have touched on this already.  But I don't really understand the pattern of your costs especially depreciation of margin through the year because you are starting 59%, gross margin of 59% in the March quarter but you end presumably even with some seasonality of revenue with a lower gross margin for the full year.  So would you expect gross margin to continuously drop through the year? Or what's the shape of the pattern? Similarly your depreciation is 1 billion in the first quarter and you end up with 4.7 billion in the full year, which suggested a ramp of 20 to 30% in depreciation as you cross the quarter.  Is there some big event that cuts in a lot of depreciation partway through the year?

A - Andy Bryant

Depreciation in the earnings release said 1 billion for this quarter, it's actually 1.1 billion.  That's a typo in the earning release.  So starting at 1.1 billion, it grows, for the year comes in at 4.7.  So you do see some depreciation growth.  What you see through the year is some cost growth.  You see normal ASP struggles.  It says margins actually, I don't want to give a quarter by quarter margins.  It's also going to be a factor of how full are the factories in the second and third quarter, and the fourth quarter.  There are a lot of working variables here.  Let's just leave it at full year, 59% plus or minus and first quarter, 60% plus or minus a couple.

Q - David Wong

Right.  Thank you.

Operator

Sir, our next question is from the line of David Wu with Global Crown Capital.

Q - David Wu

Yes, two quick questions, please.  The first thing is on capital spending.  Is that the joint venture on NAND, is your portion of the joint venture's capital spending included in that $6.7 billion guidance for calendar '06?

A - Andy Bryant

The midpoint of the guidance was 6.9 billion and it does not include the memory joint venture.  The consolidated company of that joint venture is Micron and they will report their capital spending.

Q - David Wu

Oh! I see.  Okay, so it's basically all logic and I assume more equipment than buildings?

A - Andy Bryant

Actually there's a pretty heavy construction load in this one with the two fabs we are getting started and some office buildings that we started around the world.

Q - David Wu

Okay.  The other thing is, help me one more time on this fourth quarter thing, because you said there was some low-end market slowing particularly in the Asia Pacific.  Where did the demand go to? Did it go to notebooks or did it go to competition? Or basically disappeared to things like PDAs or iPods, things of that like?

A - Andy Bryant

In reality we don't believe it quote, went any place except the consumers kept more money in their pockets.  The ones who were in Asia would buy the lower end desktop PCs.  Maybe went to a PDA and we are able to finally track the data.  Mobile laptops seemed to sell kind of normally.  Servers seemed to sell kind of normally.  What we really believe is in Asia and the low-end of the desktop there were just less computers bought by people who wanted to use them.

Q - David Wu

I see.  Okay.  Thank you.

Operator

Sir, our next question is from the line of Mark Edelstone with Morgan Stanley.

Q - Mark Edelstone

Thanks, guys.  A couple of clarifications.  One, in the press release, Andy, you talked about average selling prices down slightly.  Can we define that as 2 or 3% in the processor business?

A - Andy Bryant

I can't define it for you but 2, 3% is a slight number.

Q - Mark Edelstone

And then on the chipset business, are the constraints still in force today or have those eased up now?

A - Andy Bryant

We believe the supply metric demand today in total, we still believe there is a little bit of time it will take for everything to get rematched, resorted, and returned to what I would call normal operations.  But there is enough supply today.

Q - Mark Edelstone

That is a change from what you were seeing midway through the fourth quarter, correct?

A - Andy Bryant

Yes

Q - Mark Edelstone

Then, just lastly, from an accounting point of view on IMFT, I guess, I was surprised by your last comments that the 1.2 billion of capital spending that Intel is going to contribute to the joint venture does not show up in your CapEx numbers.  Is my understanding correct that you are consolidating the revenues and expenses? If that's true, how come the capital expenses and other items there, do not get included in your CapEx numbers?

A - Andy Bryant

We are not the consolidating company.  Micron is the Company that consolidates the JV.  So what we do is we take our portion of the JV into the other income line, they report the capital as a result.  The reason that hits my start-up costs this year is, there is an agreement between us that are start up costs for the JV are charged directly back to the two parents as opposed to kept inside the JV.  So what you will see is that Micron is the consolidating company.  They will report their revenues and the cost inside their P&L.  They will report the capital expense.  What we will take is a capital charge, not a capital expense as we contribute cash or assets into the JV.

Q - Mark Edelstone

But the revenues from that JV will not flow to your revenue line?

A - Andy Bryant

I am going to give you a sense.  But, we will purchase product from the manufacturing joint venture, IM flash technologies.  What we then resell will be revenue for us.  So my costs will come across as well with that and I will have a normal margin.  The business itself will be consolidated at Micron.  So each company will have its own revenues for the product itself.  Each company will have the appropriate cost of sales.  If there's profit or loss left in the JV, it will be in Micron's income statement at the operating line.  It will be at ours in the other income line.

Q - Mark Edelstone

Okay.  Understood.  Thank you.

Operator

And sir, our next question is from the line of Rohit Pandey with HSBC Securities.

Q - Rohit Pandey

Thank you.  A quick one on the ASPs.  A quick look at the ABC data shows that the desktops are about 25% more expensive in the mature markets compared to the emerging markets and servers about 10%.  Whereas notebooks are 15% more expensive in the emerging markets.  So do you think as the notebook penetration increases, your ASP this year would actually go down more than slightly as the product might shift to more of the value product there?

A - Paul Otellini

No, actually I don't, not in mobile.  I think that a lot of that difference in markets that you are seeing, market pricing you are seeing is that notebooks principally are sold by branded multinational firms or very large firms and a third of the desktops in the world are sold by white boxes and in the emerging markets many of those are shipped without software.  And that accounts for the bulk of that difference, differential pricing you talked about.

Q - Rohit Pandey

Okay.  And then I have a quick one on the new positioning of the Company.  Intel Inside was very clear to the consumer as to where the Company is positioned.  What are you trying to position with Leap Ahead? And then I have a follow-up, or a quick one for Andy.

A - Paul Otellini

Well, Leap Ahead won't be part of our branding program or merchandising program at the ingredient brand level.  That's the tag line much like the Nike, just go do it tag line, it's much more of a corporate identifier.  The Intel Inside program will take advantage of the existing nomenclature.  The logo has changed because we felt that the word inside, inside a swirl was redundant.  Since it's already been ingrained in 1 billion peoples psyche and this is a little bit more elegant cosmetic treatment of that.  But the program in its essence is still at the computer point-of-sale level an ingredient sale.

Q - Rohit Pandey

And for Andy could you clarify in the die bank inventory is valued differently for the tax and the GAAP purposes?

A - Andy Bryant

Which inventory?

Q - Rohit Pandey

The die bank.

A - Andy Bryant

No, the die bank, first of all, all inventory is valued, I'm sorry, you are going to get into a level of detail that normal people never want to get to.  The value of the inventory is the same in both cases.  In income statement GAAP books if you have a reserve that would lower the expected tax that you are going to pay because you have, you don't, you take a write off for that cost.  In your tax books reserves don't count, so the difference between tax and GAAP isn't in terms of the value of the inventory it is in terms of how the reserve is treated between the two different sets of books.

Q - Rohit Pandey

Okay.  Got it.  Thank you.

Operator

And, sir, our next question is from the line of Joseph Osha with Merrill Lynch.

Q - Joseph Osha

Thanks.  Listen, Andy, just looking at how the JV works, for starters, can I assume that the JV itself, not your reseller margin, but the JV itself is going to be run with an eye towards having it be break even and then the margin is earned on the resale activity by you and Micron, is that the idea?

A - Andy Bryant

That is the intent is to have it be a manufacturing JV at approximately break even if it can.

Q - Joseph Osha

Second question, then, can you maybe give me a little help in terms of understanding the magnitude of the revenue resale that is built into your target as well as some kind of sense as to what kind of start up costs that you are taking and whether those continue through 2007?

A - Andy Bryant

Some but not a lot.  In 2006 there is not a lot of revenue to be honest.  I won't tell you a specific number but it's a pretty small number.  There is some.  More importantly is the cost in the spending side.  You got a sense for the spending when we said spending growth is 11% without the JV, 9% with the JV .  So you can get a sense for how much we are putting into the R&D line for the business.  In terms of start up costs, don't want to get too specific but it is notable in the year to year reconciliation.  Not quite as big as what we saw for the logic business last year.  But in that magnitude, so….

Q - Joseph Osha

Well, let's just put it another way, then, on an apples-to-apples basis without this would gross margins be flat?

A - Andy Bryant

Gross margins would be discussed as flat.  I don't want to give you a precise rounding to decimal points.  But it's enough to cause the round to be different.

Q - Joseph Osha

Okay.  Last question and then I'll go away.  Paul, it seems to me like the repositioning of, let me rephrase the question.  It seems to me like you've top Core Duo, which was kind of initially a dual core notebook part and you are aiming it now at the desktop market as well with the Core Duo branding and with the Apple announcement.  Is that true or am I off base there?

A - Paul Otellini

It's partially true and I think it gets increasingly true over the course of the year, Joe.  Our view for sometime has been that performance per watt matters as much in the desktop particularly consumer desktops and in servers as anywhere else.  And so you saw the first part of that with the Viiv announcement where the number of the Viiv living room PCs were built around Core Duo, particularly the small stainless ones.  You also saw that last week with the iMac.  I think that you will continue to see more and more momentum towards low profile, small form factor designs consuming much more, utilizing much more energy-efficient processors.  That is particularly true when we get to mid year and start in Q3 start shipping Conro which is the new desktop product that comes off of the same power efficient course.

Q - Joseph Osha

Okay.  I'm sorry, does this margin target that you've given perhaps incorporate extra special aggressive pricing year in the desktop market as you look at 2006 and what your competitor has done.  Do you have maybe a little lower pricing umbrella built in? That's it.  Thank you.

A - Paul Otellini

Well, it's sufficient for us to be able to do what we suggested which is to regain share.

Q - Joseph Osha

Thanks a lot.

Operator

Sir, our next question is from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Moors & Cabot.

Q - Hans Mosesmann

Thanks.  Is there any change to the ramp of 65-nanometer as a result of this inventory situation?

A - Andy Bryant

No, no change at all to the ramp to 65-nanometer.  We actually are watching wafer starts closely.  We haven't changed anything.  If we did by the way, it wouldn't be in 65-nanometer.  It would be in the clearing out 90-nanometer quicker so you can make the chipset transition more quickly.

Q - Hans Mosesmann

So 90-nanometer goes away more quickly, is that--?

A - Andy Bryant

No, nothing has changed yet.  I said if we saw a weakness that we wanted to respond to that's how we would respond.  As of now we have not changed our low returning factories.

Q - Hans Mosesmann

Okay.  One last question.

A - Paul Otellini

Just to be clear, 90-nanometer doesn't go away.  We will use that technology to build chipsets and we'll be converting our chipsets from the old 8-inch network to the 12-inch 90-nanometer network over the course of 2006.

Q - Hans Mosesmann

Okay.  I see.  What is the ASP assumption for Q1 for processors?

A - Andy Bryant

I don't make ASP forecasts.  So I won't give you that one.  But you can see essentially we see gross margin percentages down mostly because of the business, somewhat because of IM flash start up costs.

Q - Hans Mosesmann

Thank you.

Operator

Sir, our next question is from the line of Allan Mishan with CIBC World Markets.

Q - Allan Mishan

Hey, guys.  A quick question.  If I look at your quarterly revenue guidance and your annual revenue guidance, you either have to have a much better than seasonal second quarter or you have to have kind of a huge second half.  Can you help handicap those two for me?

A - Andy Bryant

Certainly, what we believe is as we get past the first quarter it will get progressively better and stronger.  We think the roadmap gets progressively better and stronger.  We think the inventory will be worked out.  So I don't want to handicap between Q2, Q3, and Q4 but certainly we believe the strength builds through the year.

Q - Allan Mishan

Okay.  That's helpful.  And can you also help us understand the thinking behind the convert? If you are buying back so much stock, I guess, in hopes of reducing dilution and you are such a big company with a great credit rating why wouldn't you just do straight debt? Why would you dilute shareholders in that manner?

A - Andy Bryant

We don't believe that when we finish with the convert and the actions as a result of the convert there will be dilution of the shareholders.  We did the convert because we think there's a positive return to the Company that's ours; and we are using the funds for basically general purpose to run the Company.  Also don't, we are walk around with the assumption that says the reason we buy stock is to offset dilution of our stock options as some have said.  We are really doing it as a balancing act to getting cash back to the shareholders.

Q - Allan Mishan

Okay.  Thanks.  That's very helpful.

A - Paul Otellini

Operator, we will take two more questions, please.

Operator

Yes sir.  Our next question is from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.

Q - Jim Covello

Thanks so much.  First, quick question on the Apple Business.  How much is that going to help Q1 relative to Q4?

A - Andy Bryant

Some, but the customers are pretty sensitive about us providing their cost of sales data to the market so I really don't want to do anything other than say they will by more in Q1 than they bought in Q4.

Q - Jim Covello

Second, on the CapEx.  Can you help us understand from a wafer-fab equipment perspective, you said overall CapEx is up 18%.  Do you think the equipment portion of that is up 10, up 15, up 5, flat?

A - Andy Bryant

I will give a better break out at the analyst meeting.  Again, there is a heavy increase in construction of this piece.  There will still be increases in the equipment business as well.

Q - Jim Covello

There may be, I hate to try and pin you down but maybe 5 to 10 is a decent number?

A - Andy Bryant

I am not going to let you pin me down today.  I will give you a lot better detail in April when we are out there.

Q - Jim Covello

Final question probably.  Andy, at the Analyst Summit in Oregon, you talked about the risks of underage or overage relative, the capacity relative to demand and you talked about how even a little bit of overage can have a pretty significant impact on gross margins.  With the demand doing what it did at the end of the fourth quarter and with you guys already ramping two new fabs given the CapEx from '05.  Do you think the risk has been raised for overage a little bit in 2006?

A - Andy Bryant

If you asked me I would say ever so slightly it's something I'm watching with a lot more interest than I was a quarter ago.  It really comes down to does the worldwide economy hold up? Do we get through an inventory hiccup here? And as Paul says we gain share, the worldwide market grows as we think will be okay.  If there's extended softness it will hit margins.

Q - Jim Covello

I guess maybe one quick follow-up to that.  When you have seen inventory start to build and/or demand start to soften up a little bit.  Is it normal, that it would turn around as quickly as a quarter?

A - Andy Bryant

It's not abnormal.  It depends on the underlying strength of the business.  In this case I think it can turn around inside the quarter.  We haven't seen information out there that would cause us to say this is going to linger for the first half of the year.  It doesn't mean I would build a little more inventory than I would like.  So I will have to get my inventories fixed over the next couple of quarters.

Q - Jim Covello

Thanks very much.

Operator

And sir, we have a question from the line of Michael Masdea with Credit Suisse First Boston.

Q - Michael Masdea

Great.  Thanks a lot.  When you guys talk about gaining share in Q2 through Q4, sometime in that time frame, it sounds like Paul is maybe saying that dual core is the main driver.  Paul, is that more from a cost structure perspective, the power side? Or what do you feel like your true advantage is over the competitor, the dual core out there?

A - Paul Otellini

Well, we are on a technology generation conversion well ahead of them.  That gives us a cost advantage, a performance advantage, a die size advantage, and an overall power envelope advantage.  That clearly has clear merits in notebooks, and clear merits in blade servers where people don't have to retool their data centers, and I think that will have clearer merits in consumer PCs over time as a result of the form factor discussion.  In addition we are launching our first platform brand for enterprise focused on manageability and that will come out in the second half of the year; at the same time as IT shops will be looking at Vista ready purchases.  So I think that overall we have a pretty compelling list of attributes to bring to market in '06.

Q - Michael Masdea

Okay.  Great.  And then, I guess on the memory side.  I've seen you kind of take a variety of strategies, you fund other companies that do development, you do JVs now and you also have your NOR piece internally.  Longer term is memory a piece that you are going to continue to treat multiple ways? Or is it something you want to get off your own books going forward? Or how do you think about memory longer time?

A - Paul Otellini

Putting a lot more on, effectively our books with the NAND joint venture.  That's a pretty big bet on NAND and we intend to be a number one, number two player over the course of that entities existence.

Q - Michael Masdea

Is that the structure you are going to favor more going forward is JV rather than, just tell me the whole thing.

A - Paul Otellini

No, I can't say that.  This was a very opportune deal and the partner, the two-parters were melded nicely with the right attributes and time to market capabilities.

Q - Michael Masdea

Got it.  The last question.  You made a comment earlier about spending around platforms.  Do we need to think about platform spending as an overall higher spend per desktop server, mobile, et cetera and the hope is that, we do with Centrino, just a much bigger revenue pie from that.  Is that how you think about it?

A - Paul Otellini

Yes.  I think I explained it in the last analyst meeting in terms of the Centrino model, but it's, in theory it generates a higher ASP for us, a higher build of materials presence for us, faster market expansion for us and our customers, and everybody wins.

Q - Michael Masdea

Got it.  Thanks a lot.

Q&A
Operator:  Thank you very much, sir.   Our first question comes from the line of Apjit Walia of RBC.  Please proceed.
Q:  Thank you. Essentially Andy for the September quarter, if you did not have the chipset constraint, how much more revenues could there be?
A:  Well, it is difficult to estimate. If we had not had the chipset constraint, it would certainly cause us to round to the next higher, if not a little bit more.
Q:  Great. And I am terms of the inventory build, with the end customer, essentially is this, I mean are you seeing this across the board or is it more specific? And where do you think it comes from.
A:  I don't want to point out any specific customer but there is not a lot of them.  We saw the inventory build.  And what happened, I think, is we have been in a period of tightness.  Our customers do want to make sure they have respond to a fourth quarter upside and in reality it is perfectly natural if you can get a few extra part, you get a few extra parts.
Q:  And lastly, if you were to rate India and China as revenues, what would they be right now?
A:  I'm sorry?
Q:  China and India as end markets, what would they be in revenues right now in your respective.
A:  China would be far greater than India at this point.  And I think that China is probably 
A :  China is about to become, or if it hasn't already, the second largest consumption market in the world for PC's after the U.S.  It is about to pass Japan.  So it is in that range.
A:  China, what we called out specifically, because it is a big enough percentage of revenue, so you will see that.  India is much smaller at this point.  Clearly just getting under way as a growth market.
Q:  Great. Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you very much, sir.  Ladies and gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Mr. Chris Caso of Friedman Billings Ramsey.  Please proceed.
Q:  Yes, hi, thank you. I wonder if you could just give some more color on the gross margins and, specifically the increase for the fourth quarter, if you can kind of break down for us where the sequential increase comes from, perhaps, break it out by the different components?
A :  By far, the vast majority of the increase in large percentage for the fourth quarter will be in the qualification of the products in 65-nanometer production.  You always get a little bit of benefit when have you increasing revenue, particularly in a quarter when you make processors the biggest driver, so to a small amount, we have the product mix.  By far, the biggest explanation will be adding the qualification for the 65-nanometer product.
Q:  Okay. And as a follow-up, if you can just,, address, obviously, a lot has been discussed about the capacity constraints that you're under right now.  How do you see that playing out perhaps into Q4 and into Q1.  Which areas do you still expect to be tight as you exit the year and go into Q1?
A :  Clearly, the chip set constraint will continue into the fourth quarter.  We are producing more chip sets ourselves.  We do have relationships now with a couple of other suppliers who will be providing chip sets for the low end desk top.  It takes a while for that competitor to come online.  I still think you will hear a fair amount of noise in the third quarter.  We are hopeful that as we get to the end of the quarter we will start to get some relief from the constraints we have been seeing.
Q:  Okay. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you very much, sir.  Ladies and gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Christopher Danely with JP Morgan.  Please proceed.
Q:  Thanks, guys.  Just a quick clarification and then on to the questions.  So, Andy, you said that the reason that the Q4 sales guidance is a little less than seasonal is basically because Q3 was better than seasonal and there is a little bit of an inventory build out there?  Is that where we're going?
A :  That's correct. I said that I thought there was about $100 million of inventory build in the third quarter, which means if you look at quote normal consumption, it would have put us back more towards the midpoint of the third quarter season.  If you recall last year, we had a situation like that, and we over forecast the following quarter, and not allowing the inventory to be used by a customer, so what we see is seasonal consumption, and we see about $100 million inventory swing for us between the third and fourth quarter.
Q:  Okay. And how about your own inventory? How do you expect that to change in Q4?
A :  Well, you saw inventory up under $100 million, all essentially good for the third quarter, which was a pleasant surprise, to be honest.  And I do think as we qualify the product for the 65-nanometer, that then does put some spending into inventory and I would expect to see the increase in inventory levels in the hundreds of millions, above 200, less than 400, something like that.
Q:  Okay. That's fine. Thanks a lot, guys.
Operator:
Thank you very much. And again, ladies and gentlemen, we do have a question, please key * 1.  Our next question comes from the line of Michael Masdea of Credit Suisse First Boston.  Please proceed.
Q:  Thanks a lot. Continuing on the gross margin side, one of the major concerns out there is that we may be at or around peak gross margin for Intel.  Can you talk to us about the dynamics that are playing out in '06 that go into making a decision like that or a call like that? What are the moving parts and cogs that we should think about next year assuming that demand is alright and ASPs don't surprise us in a big way.
A:  You took away all other factors.  The biggest factor of gross margin next year will be demand, will be the worldwide economic health and our factories stay full, our margins will remain fine.  I think that our product is getting stronger and stronger as the year goes on.  I like our product lineup at this point and what it comes down to, can I keep my factories full, and if I can, we're in pretty good shape and continue to make our cost targets and continue to have a decent year.  I'm not going to make that call until January.  January, we will give you an estimation as to how we think the year will unfold.
Q:  Is there a structural limit that were hitting up against here? I guess that's what I'm getting at.
A :  The answer is no.  But, I'm not going to tell you, if you go back through our entire history, it doesn't get much better than it does in the fourth quarter. There are ways it could be margins could be higher but it is a complex mix that has to be how successful your chip set business arch the flash business and the mixers involved and different types of processors involved, and a lot of moving parts.  It can be higher, and quite frankly it can be lower.  Again, why don't you wait until January and I will try to give you a little bit more insight.
Q:  A quick follow up on the chip outset I'm trying to recall Intel has been capacity restraint consistently for a year and is there something else going on here that is driving this on the transition of 300-millimeter or anything else that is factoring in here?
A:  The factories are helping, no issue there.  The chip sets are on the 8-inch network.  We're transitioning to the 12-inch network next year, which will certainly give us a lot of relief.  I would say we're gearing toward a decision to try not to grow the 8-inch network.  We want to invest in the 12-inch, which is our future.  Demand spiked on us and as a result we got tighter than we would like.  The investment goes forward these days.
Q:  Makes sense.  Thanks a lot.
Operator:
Thank you very much, sir.  Ladies and gentlemen, our next question comes from the line of Mr. John Lau of Jefferies & Company.  Please proceed.
Q:  Thank you.  Andy, circling back to the inventory comments, I think most people are concerned about.  That so specifically, do you believe that this inventory is prudent given the current tightness?  And if so, and if you take a look at the PC demand, if that remains seasonal throughout the year, seasonally normal throughout the rest of the year, will that inventory sell through without any excess by year end?  Thank you.
A:  I clearly believe the inventory that we have in the third quarter is prudent.  In fact if I could have it today, I would take it today.  And it is in a time when we have been constrained, we're doing all we can to try to make sure we have the parts available.  We've learned many times again, which you see over this last year, Intel is always better to have parts available ready for an upturn and not constrained like we have been.  So yes, inventory is prudent.  Under normal business conditions we will not have excess inventory. It is a very controlled normal environment.  The only thing that is going to cause me a problem will be if there is a worldwide economic problem.  And demand drops more than you would see in the first and second quarter.
Q:  And those comments, I was also relating not only to your own inventory, but the inventory that you had commented with regards to your major customers.  Is that correct?
A:  Absolutely.  Again, $100 million in the worldwide PC networks is very small.  We still are in a situation today where we have customers in channels we would like to actually have more products.  So we have outlets if we would have inventory right now.
Q:  Okay. And just, I know I'm beating this again on you, but assuming a normal PC seasonal demand out there this shouldn't be an issue by year-end then?
A:  Right. Are you talking about year-end '06?
Q:  No, this Q4.
A:  Oh, absolutely not. By year-end '04, as I said earlier, I still think I'm going to be struggling to meet the chipset demand. I think the nanoprocessors is gone.
Q:  Thank you very much for answering that.
Operator:
Thank you very much, sir.  Ladies and gentlemen, the next question comes from the line of Mr. Adam Parker of Sanford Bernstein.  Please proceed.
Q:  Yes, could you give a little more color about Q4, your guidance in revenue in particular?  Do you think it is indicative of a slowing PC market, a sense that maybe your blended ASPs are going to be down? I think you said they're flat sequentially.  Or is it continued share loss to AMD who has guided to more like 10% growth that is making you,, coming into I guess it is several points below normal seasonality?
A:  So I will choose the fourth, and say none of the above.  What I believe is happening is there is a bit of inventory build in the third quarter, that inventory will be sold out in the fourth quarter, and quote, the extra inventory won't be replenished but as a result it will appear to be an above seasonal third quarter for us, and a below seasonal fourth quarter consumption in PCs, and PC-type products will be perfectly cease seasonal for the third quarter and the fourth quarter.
Q:  I mean if you add 100 million to your midpoint, which is the number you're throwing out there, and it is still, it doesn't get you to even the lower end of normal seasonality over the last five years so it just seems like, maybe we're splitting hairs on a couple hundred million dollars, I'm just trying to figure out do you think that anything else is going on?
A:  I agree.  You also subtract 100 out of the third quarter.  And if you take 100 out of the third quarter, you have a seasonal third quarter and if you add 110 to the fourth quarter number from the third quarter number, you are back to your seasonal fourth quarter.
Q:  It is close enough.  All right.  The other question is, you talked about, trying to keep your revenue growth above your operating expense growth, and are you looking at a year where SG&A growth is going to be about 20% plus or minus above your revenue growth.  It is there something that you can point to in terms of why that is really had to come up a lot in the last year?  Is it competitive positioning or new initiatives with dual core? And how should I think about, the SG&A growth in particular going forward? Are we in a new environment where that is going to have to be still pretty high or how should I think about that?
A:  If you look at we will take R&D and SG&A and look at it as a combined investment spending.  Year-over-year, the increase in that bucket will be the same as the increase in revenue for '05 versus '04.  The difference you're seeing is the front half of the year we grew spending at a much lower rate, as we have in some prior years.  And the second half of the year spending more quickly.  We have every intention now to trail off the spending growth to match revenue growth next year.  So we think where we're at for the year right now is a pretty comfortable place to be.
Q:  So I'm kind of confused.  Why do I have to think about it as combined SG&A and R&D? I guess dumb Wall Street guys sort of think R&D going toward technology and the SG&A going toward marketing.  Is that too simplistic?
A:  We think of them as both investments.  For example, we have to choose between whether you're going to do a new version of a processor versus a marketing program like Centrino.  Or _____ you get a return on each of those.  And what we have to do, under the guise of trying to make sure spending in total matches revenue growth, it depends, figure out which of those we think we will get the best return on and allocate spending appropriately.  We don't separate the two buckets.  We make investment choices in total.
Q:  Got you. So bottom line is long term there is no operating leverage? I mean in terms there is no operating expense
A:  Our intent right now long term would be to have revenue and spending grow pretty much in line with each other.
Q:  Thanks. Take care, guys.
Operator
Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Tim Luke of Lehman Brothers.  Please proceed.
Q:  Thanks. And I was wondering in your guidance of midpoint, could you give us any sense of after the quarter and third quarter digital enterprise was up around and mobility under around 12 or 13, whether one would continue to expect the mobility to exceed the digital enterprise growth or talk about maybe some of the factors, influencing the differentiated growth rates of the two areas?
A:  We certainly expect to see mobility to be a driver of growth.  It is now a year ago, we would sit and talk about it, and talk about the U.S., and is not a worldwide phenomenon.  It is going to continue, we're seeing the price points of those products hit in the places around the world where many, many more people are choosing to have the ability to have a laptop to be mobile.  And American business, you see it almost exclusively, being what is being bought, same thing in Western Europe.  I don't see it changing.  The capabilities of those machines are such that they will continue to be the growth driver.
Q:  So it could be a double of the growth rate of one over the other?
A:  I don't want to get pinned down to giving growth rate percentages off of baseline inventories.  We don't provide it to being with.  I would just say, you can look at (36.19) has been, it is going to continue for a while.  We don't think we've begun to hit the equilibrium point yet.
Q:  And just with respect to the inventory, the 100 million is in which area? Which of the product line?
A:  It would be well, I will say in the Intel architecture product line.  I would say it is not flash or communications stuff.
Q:  But it is likely to be on the service side or how should we view that? Or is broad?
A:  I don't want to define it any more than that.  It is in the Intel architecture, so think logic, and silicon, and as my friend Paul is pointing out to me, $100 million equals about two days worth of shipments, so it is a small number.
Q:  And lastly, as we look at the beginning of next year, if we assume normal seasonality, just if you could give us any flavor of the factors that may influence the gross margin from this very high 63% level, as you end this calendar year?
A:  No, I'm going to, I have got new back one, I will hold off answering '06 margin questions until '06.
Q:  Thanks.
Operator:
Thank you very much, sir.  Ladies and gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Joe Osha from Merrill Lynch.  Please proceed.
Q:  Hi, folks.  Two questions.  First, just back of the envelope math, in terms of your silicon acreage next year, if you will, would indicate to me that your capacity growth for 2006 is going to be higher than 2005.  Is that a reasonable statement?
A:  Yes.
Q:  Okay.  All in 300 millimeter?
A:All in 300-millimeter.
Q:  Okay. Second question, you bought back now $7.5 billion worth of stock this year a lot of it at higher levels than where the stock is now.  You got a market multiple basically, your dividend yield is half the Dow, so I guess my question is, since the market obviously isn't necessarily being all that impressed by these buybacks, why is the dividend yield on this stock not twice what it is?
A:  That's a decision made by the Board.  It is a decision that gets debated throughout the time frame and those discussions are under way, and if they decided to change the dividend yield, we will certainly let you know within 24 hours.
Q:  Well, I mean you're a smart guy.  What's your impression of why it is the Street is not rewarding this massive stock buyback?
A:  Actually, that is a hard debate for us to get into.  If we hadn't done matching buyback, the price would be the same.  Anyway, I don't really actually I'm not going to go there.  We will continue to look at ways to return cash to shareholders, and I'm sure we will look at whether we should increase the dividend and do more of that versus buybacks.
Q:  And just back to the first question.  Is it fair to say that the incremental just confirming your incremental capacity comes from bringing the conversion of Chandler back up, and then also continuing to ramp the second phase of Ireland?
A:  Yes.
Q:  Okay. Thanks, very much.
Operator:
Thank you very much, sir.  Ladies and gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Michael McConnell of Pacific Crest Securities.  Please proceed.
Q:  Hi. Thank you.  A question for Paul.  Paul, with the Bensley right around the horizon, what should we expect in terms of the server market, with the competition there? Are you expecting to regain some share with Bensley, or do you have a higher degree of confidence that if we look into the summer with the new architecture on the micro server time, should that be the time we think about share reversals in the server market?
A:  I think that I'm not going to give you a specific number, Michael, but we've got three events all of which are very positive in our server line.  One is the tax bill launch for DP a dual processor, and then MP, which is coming later this quarter, which are already having an impact in our volumes.  The second is the Bensley platform launch in Q1 that you referenced which I think will give us another pop.  Implicit also in Q1 is our first very low power blade for servers, Soccer man will be shipping, and then mid year, you're right, we have the next generation 65-nanometer products woodcrest platform shipping.  All three of those events happening over a kind of a quarter a piece, over the next year, really give us much more competitive road map in '06 than we have today even.  And I would expect to be able to exploit it.
Q:  In terms of though, an inflection, should we think about it being more gradual? I'm just trying to get a sense of your perm confidence and when we can  
A:  We're going to ship the heck out of them when we get them.  At that point it just becomes how our customer does.
Q:  Okay.  But any sense of just feedback from the customer right now?
A:  They're all very excited, and the feedback about pulling the product line in is very, we're very well received.  Our customers, as you've already seen, are able to exploit it with a dollar per TPC number that Dell put out, giving them industry leadership on that platform.
Q:  Okay. And then one last question, just on the chip set side, on the low-end desk topside, there's been some speculation that Intel is going to be exiting that segment.  Should we look at that as being strained or is this a matter of you being constrained right now as we go into Q1 you start to ramp the chip sets at 90-nanometer, are you expecting some of the third party arrangements that have you right now to work their way back down, and then you start to obviously ship what you want to within that particular market segment?
A: We backed off on the low-end desktop volumes this year, because of the capacity constraints.  And we didn't get out entirely.  We backed down some.  And you will see us as we get capacity over the course of the next year, re-enter that part of the market again.  It is our intention to be a broad-based supplier of chipsets.  It is intrinsic to our platform strategy.
Q:  Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you very much, sir.  Ladies and gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Tom Thornhill of UBS.  Pease proceed.
Q:  Thank you.  Question for Andy in gross margins.  You laid out a unit cost program at analyst meeting about a year ago, Q4 '04 to Q4 '06, down 25%.
A:  Yes.
Q:  Where are we on that plan? How much progress have we made? How much progress is there yet to go?
A:  Today, I'm a little ahead on that plan.  And if my factories can stay full next year, I'm pretty comfortable with that plan.  What it comes down to, today, Tom, quite frankly it is also a give me, because the fact I'm building everything I can build.  If we have normal loadings next year with the company on track to make it, today with loading, I'm ahead of where I thought I would be.
Q:  Are we about halfway through this plan or? 
A:  Boy, I don't want to wing it.  Sorry, I don't know the specific number we had for this particular time.
Q:  I'm not trying to be that precise.  I'm trying to estimate it, how much more there is to go.
A:  There certainly is more to go next year.  You get the benefits of 65-nanometer coming across the product line.  You get more 300 millimeter near the product line.  You get, non-processor products fitting into the 300-millimeter factories.  So there is the technology is bringing more benefit through next year.
Q:  In '05, gross margins were impacted by 65-nanometer start-up costs and I understand that their start-up costs continually on new process, but there are ramps and sort of tidal surges in those.  What has in '06, is there something similar in the offering that we had in '05 or not?
A:  Not the same level of tidal surge.  As you get towards the end of next year, you will begin to start seeing the beginning efforts of getting ready for the next manufacturing process.  But it is to back in the last year and it will be much smaller than we saw in '05.
Q:  Okay. Paul, a question about enterprise.  Revenue growth quarter to quarter, can you differentiate at all between desktop and server? I mean it is clear that mobility had good growth, because we can see that, the way you report, but between server and desktop, was there a difference in the growth rates?
A:  There was a no difference.  They were both positive.  That's about as much granularity as I can give you Tom.  We grew units in both desktops and processors this quarter.
Q:  Given that your servers were up, and since we know what your competitor has already reported about their sequential growth, they are clearly the rate of share change slowed, what were the key factors in that, in the first quarter?  That carry into Q4?
A:  Again, a new platforms shipping, we've been doing actually better than we expected internally this year because our product line has been able to be pulled in over the course of the year.  Bits and pieces and that along with our customers being pretty aggressive, you've seen bell be aggressive, you've seen HP be aggressive, IBM with the hurricane platform has done very well with Intel based XEON products.  All of those combined have given us pretty solid year-end servers.  Better than I had expected coming into the year.
Q:  Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you very much, sir.  Ladies and gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with Harris Nesbitt.  Please proceed.
Q:  Hi Andy just trying to considering your comments on channel business, you mentioned it was flat Q-over-Q.  And then you talk about growth in emerging markets.  And what am I missing here? Is there something going on, IE, some market share shifts or how should we be looking at it going forward?
A:  The emerging markets are served more than just by the channel.  You have big local OEMs like novo and Dell establishing presence and you have HP being active and what tends to happen this quarter is we saw the large OEMs being more successful in all markets, emerging markets particularly, versus the channel, but not the management.  Like I said, the channel is flat, so the growth happening in the OEMs happens around the world.
Q:  And this is about between 10 to 30% of your total business, is that correct?
A:  It tends to be at the high end of the numbers that you just listed.
Q:  And should we expect it to be up in Q4?
A:  It hangs around the 30%, plus or minus a couple of point force the last decade so I wouldn't see it moving out of that range.
Q:  Okay. Thanks.
Operator:
Thank you very much, sir.  Ladies and gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann of Moors & Cabot.  Please proceed.
Q:  Thanks. Quick question on Bensley.  What is the performance improvement over Paxville ill that we can expect to see?
A:  Well, we're not allowed to give out TPC numbers until they're in volume but we're comfortable that this will be a very competitive platform and it is not just in TPCs, it is as I said earlier, we've got other platform features in terms of manage ability and virtualization that will be released with that platform that we think have nice value-add for our customers.
Q:  Okay and a quick follow up 65-nanometer, when do you expect the crossover to consider in '06, if it does occur in '06.
A:  I think I said in my commentary, by the third quarter we will have crossed.
Q:  I think you said for the performance
A:  Oh, you meant for the entirety?
Q:  Right.
A:  I don't have that number in front of me.  I'm sorry.
Q:  All right. Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you very much, sir.  Ladies and gentlemen, your next question comes in from the line of Cody Acree of Legg Mason.  Please proceed.
Q:  Thanks. Paul, following up on the server side, not being able to give specific jumps in performance, but it does sound like Woodcrest is going to be a real step function in capability.  Do you run into an issue, maybe where there is such an anticipation in the step functioning capability that we see some delayed purchases during the first half of next year, waiting on this new architecture to come out next year?
A:  I have never seen that yet in my history of this industry.  So it would be remarkable for that to happen.  And I don't think so. I think people tend to buy from their existing vendors, when they need the product, and they look at the road maps, they have to vault them, and the one difference is when they see the need for a new blade server that may have a lower power envelope into an existing data system, that is something that might actually be something that people wait for and you have seen us launching the product early in Q1.
Q:  Okay. And then just secondly, last year, you guys ran into an issue in excess supply, partially at 90-nanometer yields came up faster than you anticipated. 65 sounds like it is coming on pretty quickly here.  As you run into next year and you start to look at a little inventory building here internally, not knowing exactly where demand is going to fall next year, but yet it looks as though yields are progressing well, what are you doing to make sure we don't see some repeat of that upward yield surprise last year?
A:  Well, the difference this time is 90-nanometer factories will be a pressure relief valve for our chipset business, which as Andy indicated, are essentially built-on our eight-inch network today and therefore constrained at the upper end of their volumes.  By having the processors move to 65-nanometers, we free up capacity for chip sets.  And that allows us to move on to the next generation, more capability, lower cost, and ultimately take the eight-inch either offline or retrofit that.
Q:  Thanks.
Operator:
Thank you very much, sir.  Ladies and gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Mr. Ben Lynch of Deutsche Bank.  Please proceed.
Q:  Hi there. First question I had was, Andy, you guys have stuck to this sort of typical $600 million revenue range guidance for Q4.  Given that your capacity constrained, I would think that you might have a tighter view on attainable revenues.  Sort of removed one degree of freedom.  I'm just wondering how much is their revenues attainable sensitive to capacity constraints?  And somebody asked specific to Q3, what did you, you think the dollars left on the table were, and you didn't want to get pinned down.  Could you maybe comment on that for Q4, please?
A:  Sure.  The, there is a reasonable probability it could show up in the upper end of that range.  Remember we are building the inventory.  If demand is strong enough to consume that inventory, we do have upside to the current range.  So I don't think I'm capacity limbed at this point.  We do make sure we have chip sets available, that customers do have a little bit more juggling than they normally do, but I'm pretty comfortable with the inventory build I have planned, that if demand is strong, that we can find a way to meet higher levels in the midpoint we've given.
Q:  Okay
A:  In terms of whether Q4 will be constrained.  It is tough to predict.  At this time, I don't think I see chip sets con straining the business, other than the chip set business, and it's hard to know today exactly how much that will be.  It is hard to even know looking backwards how much it is con strained to prior quarters.  So I think there will be some constraint.  I think there will be some lost revenue opportunity in the chip set space.  And I think the rest of the business will be about okay.
Q:  Okay. And you're not sort of factoring in the possibility as just product availability for a tight for chipsets that you ship a bit later in the quarter than you normally would?
A:  It certainly is a possibility but again the customer base is pretty resourceful in finding ways to meet demand if demand is now.  So I think we will continue to see people scrambling, we will continue to see people doing all they can to meet customer's demands because they're concerned of a loss shipment a delayed shipment is a lost shipment.
Q:  And the other phenomenon that you have is we're launching the Napa platform and the Viiv platform in Q1.  So I think people will take product later in the quarter in anticipation of the launches in the January timeframe.
A:  Right.
Q:  Okay.  And then the second question I have is then for you Paul, directly was I think in September, according to current analytic, one of the houses out there, they say that AMD for the first time ever over took you in U.S. retail desk top for a full month.  Can you take a bit about this in terms of, to you think the data is sort of representative of what happened? It doesn't really matter? It is due to chip set shortages? You guys are focusing on notebooks? Just sort of give your perspective on that, please.
A:  Well it is about of all three of those.  I did see the data just briefly and I haven't analyzed it yet, but the first approximation, I can't argue with.  It the U.S. retail phenomena, though, have you to remember is no longer reflective of the U.S. consumer market.  Because it excludes the direct business.  For example Dell is not in there and Dell is the largest consumer vendor in the United States.  So you need to really add Dell's numbers into that to get a snapshot of the U.S. consumer numbers.  Number two, as we were constrained on low end desktop chip set, much of those were retail oriented and for companies like Hewlett Packard, and the results are what you saw as a result in U.S. retail.  On a worldwide basis, the numbers don't look anywhere near like that.
Q:  Great. Okay.  Thank you very much.
A:  Operator, We will take two more questions, please.
Operator:
Thank you, sir.  The next question comes from the line of Charlie Glavin of Needham & Company.  Please proceed.
Q:  Thanks.  Hopefully not beating a dead horse, Andy but in terms of the last comment, when you said that the delayed shipment is potentially a lost shipment, in terms of stock-out, when you take a look at the 100 million in the inventory, was that essentially due to a constraint? And did some of your lower guidance for fourth quarter, based on an assumption that some of that 100 million, or what was constrained in the third quarter won't materialize in the fourth quarter?
A:  Well, I'm not honestly I don’t I think I followed the entire question.  Can you do it again?
Q:  The 100 million build that occurred at some of the larger OEMs, I assume was due to constraints and the inability of some of those OEMs being able to ship?
A:  I don't think so.  I think it was the OEMs wanting to make sure they're prepared for an up Q4 and have inventory in place when they had a chance to have it. I don't think it was lost orders for them.
Q:  Maybe looked at it a different way, you answered earlier that you did believe that some that there was some upside that could have been realized in the third quarter.  And what I'm looking for is whether or not we are still somewhat tight in the fourth quarter.  Could that spill over into the first quarter as you like to bend people are still scrambling and make sure a delayed shipment does not become an outright stock out and a lost shipment?
A:  It is possible if we're con strained in the first couple of months, some revenues lost that could have been had.  I think I was talking about our revenue, and I'm not speaking for our customers.  You need to get their input, their data from them.  And in our case, we believe if we had more chip sets, we could have shipped more chip sets.
Q:  Andy, one other question, just in terms of the shift going on right now. I noticed your tax rate actually coming up a little bit, even with the other issues.  And yet, your shipments to Asia are well over 50%, and seem to continue to grow fairly well.  Can you give some sort of idea as far as is there a shift going on right now, or some of the stall-outs, and Paul, to that idea, the ESPD group, in terms of the server side, included with the OEMs or within channel group? Just for a little more clarity.
A:  Our tax rate, I will do the tax rate one first.  Our tax rate is essentially a function of mostly where the fabrication takes place.  As more is done in the United States and Arizona, and in the development Fab out in Oregon, you see a higher percentage of the revenue and less effectively a higher tax environment.
A:  Your question on the service, all of the server revenue is reported in the DEG or Enterprise Revenue Group, whether it is shipped through the channel or through the OEMs.
Q:  Okay I think when were you talking about flat channel, any progress in terms of that ESPD group as far as enabling now particularly toward the i campaigns?
A:  Yes, that continues to grow.  The numbers are relatively small in that server space, but they're growing.
Q:  Okay.
Operator:  Thank you very much, sir.  And ladies and gentlemen, our last question this evening comes from the line of Glenn young of Citigroup Investment Research.  Please proceed.
Q:  Thank you.  I guess either for Andy or Paul.  If I were to look at, let's say your guidance plays out for the fourth quarter.  Can you compare where your utilization would look like exiting Q4 of this year compared to how it looked exiting Q4 of last year?
A:  Exiting Q4 of this year would probably be a little higher than exiting Q4 of last year.  If you recall last year in the fourth quarter, we had the 12-inch factories full by the end of the fourth quarter.  We had wafers start in 8-inch factory full.  However, we started though in the middle of the quarter that the lead time to get through the factories.  At this point, everything is full.  Beginning in the first quarter, first part of the quarter.  So in effect, have you a little higher utilization but not dramatically.  In both cases, you see three or pretty full factors.
Q:  And one of the elements of this year's first quarter was 65-nanometer start- up charges looking better than you had anticipated.  And I think you answered this already but just to be clear, you don't have anything like that in the first quarter of next year where it could play a factor in the way gross margins could proceed?
A:  Again, I'm trying to stay away from next year's margin questions but there is, to my knowledge now, actually no big surprises in the first quarter, no.
Q:  And then early in the year, you had talked about ASP pressure in servers in particular.  And I wonder if we looked out into 2006, at Bensley, both with Dempsey and Woodcrest, middle of the year, whether you would anticipate the pricing pressure next year would not be as intense as it was earlier this year?
A:  I do think our products are getting stronger versus competition but I really can't talk about pricing for next year.  It is way too soon.
Q:  And the last question, just to absolutely clarify this, when you look out at your guidance for the fourth quarter, recognize can that the combination between Q3 and Q4 is normally seasonal, has there in fact been any change from your customers' perspective in term what was they're telling in terms of what demand will look like in either quarter?
A:  Yeah.  We see nothing other than business as usual with a little bit of inventory build.
Q:  Thank you. Thank you very much.",https://seekingalpha.com/article/3730-full-transcript-of-intels-3q05-conference-call-q-and-a-intc
